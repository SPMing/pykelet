				<p>In light of the recent BICEP2 B-mode polarization detection, which implies a large inflationary tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.05 = 0.2 +0.07 −0.05 , we reexamine the evidence for an extra sterile massive neutrino, originally invoked to account for the tension between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum and local measurements of the expansion rate H0 and cos-mological structure. With only the standard active neutrinos and power-law scalar spectra, this detection is in tension with the upper limit of r &lt; 0.11 (95% confidence) from the lack of a corresponding low multipole excess in the temperature anisotropy from gravitational waves. An extra sterile species with the same energy density as is needed to reconcile the CMB data with H0 measurements can also alleviate this new tension. By combining data from the Planck and ACT/SPT temperature spectra, WMAP9 polarization, H0, baryon acoustic oscillation and local cluster abundance measurements with BICEP2 data, we find the joint evidence for a sterile massive neutrino increases to ∆N eff = 0.98 ± 0.26 for the effective number and ms = 0.52 ± 0.13 eV for the effective mass or 3.8σ and 4σ evidence respectively. We caution the reader that these results correspond to a joint statistical evidence and, in addition, astrophysical systematic errors in the clusters and H0 measurements, and small-scale CMB data could weaken our conclusions. The recent detection of degree scale B-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the BICEP2 experiment [1] implies that the inflationary ratio of tensor-to-scalar fluctuations is r 0.05 = 0.2</p>

				<p>−0.05 , a number in significant tension with the upper limit of r &lt; 0.11 at 95% confidence level from the temperature anisotropy spectrum in the simplest inflationary ΛCDM cosmology [2]. This conflict occurs because the large angle temperature excess implied by the gravitational waves is not observed, and the mismatch cannot be compensated by parameter changes in this highly restricted, seven parameter model. Aside from the possibility of large astrophysical [1, 3, 4] or cosmological [5–9] foreground and systematic contamination , possible solutions include extending the inflationary side or the ΛCDM side of this model. Inflationary modifications include a large running of the scalar tilt [1]; more explicit features in the inflationary scalar spectra [10–12]; or anticorrelated isocurvature perturbations [13]. In the present work, we instead consider extensions to the matter content of the ΛCDM model that can alleviate this early Universe tension.</p>

				<p>In the ΛCDM cosmology, recall that the Planck CMB temperature anisotropy spectrum is also in conflict with * cdvorkin@ias.edu measurements of the local Universe [14–16]. The ΛCDM values for the current expansion rate – or Hubble constant , H 0 – and the abundance of galaxy clusters are individually in 2 − 3σ tension with direct measurements. While similar tensions existed in previous CMB data sets (e.g. [17]), the Planck results suggest a shift in the sound horizon that brings close agreement between CMB-based H 0 inferences and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements while disfavoring other possible explanations related to cosmic acceleration physics.</p>

				<p>In this work, we show that both the early Universe and the local Universe tension with the Planck data may be pointing to the same extension of the ΛCDM cosmology: an extra massive sterile neutrino. Such a neutrino would modify the sound horizon at recombination, which is used to infer distances with both the CMB and BAO, removing the tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant. By changing the relationship between the CMB sound horizon and the damping scale, it also leads to an increase in the scalar tilt that suppresses large angle anisotropy relative to the simpler model. Finally, if the neutrino carries a mass in the eV range it suppresses the growth of structure and hence reduces the number of galaxy clusters predicted in the local Universe.</p>

				<p>In §I we define the ΛCDM model along with its tensor and neutrino extensions and group the data sets by the early and local Universe tensions they expose. We present results in §II and discuss them in §III.</p>

			</div>

				<head>I. MODELS AND DATA</head>

				<p>The simplest inflationary ΛCDM model is characterized by 6 parameters, {Ω c h 2 , Ω b h 2 , τ, θ MC , A s , n s }. Here, Ω c h 2 represents the physical cold dark matter (CDM) density, Ω b h 2 is the baryon density, τ is the Thomson optical depth to reionization, θ MC is a proxy for the angular acoustic scale at recombination, A s is the amplitude of the initial curvature power spectrum at k = 0.05 Mpc −1 , and n s its spectral index.</p>

				<p>To these parameters we add r, the tensor-scalar ratio evaluated at k = 0.002 Mpc −1 , and take the tensor tilt to follow the consistency relation n t = −r/8. For the neutrino extension we add two new parameters. The first is the effective number of relativistic species, N eff , defined in terms of the relativistic energy density at high redshift</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In the minimal model, N eff = 3.046 and so ∆N eff = N eff −3.046 &gt; 0 indicates the presence of extra relativistic particle species in the early Universe. We assume that the active neutrinos have m ν = 0.06 eV (as suggested by a normal hierarchy and solar and atmospheric oscillation measurements [18]) and any additional contributions are carried by a mostly sterile state, with effective mass m s for a total neutrino contribution to the energy density today of</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Thus m s characterizes extra non-CDM energy density rather than the true (Lagrangian) mass of a neutrinolike particle. In particular even in the ∆N eff → 0 limit, at fixed m s , the presence of an extra sterile species still adds an extra energy density component at recombination and still changes inferences based on the sound horizon.</p>

				<p>In the most recent version of CosmoMC [19], a prior on the physical mass of a thermally produced sterile neutrino is imposed with a value of m s /(∆N eff ) 3/4 &lt; 10eV to close off a degeneracy between very massive neutrinos and cold dark matter. We call these extensions the νΛCDM and νrΛCDM models, where the names follow from the additional parameters introduced by tensors and neutrinos. For the data sets, we consider combinations that best expose the separate early and local Universe tensions with what we refer to as the central (C) Universe – the time intermediate between inflation at the late Universe , characterized chiefly by the CMB temperature power spectrum. This C data set is composed of the Planck temperature [2], WMAP9 polarization [20], and ACT/SPT [21–23] high multipole power spectra. For the Planck data analysis we marginalize over the standard</p>

				<p>Planck foreground parameters [2]. For the early Universe tension, we add to these what we call the early (E) data set, the BICEP2 BB and EE polarization bandpowers [1]. We call the combination of these two the early-central (EC) Universe data set. For the local Universe tension, we define the following collection as the local (L) data sets: the H 0 inference from the maser-cepheid-supernovae distance ladder, h = 0.738 ± 0.024 [24], BAO measurements [25–27], and the X-ray derived cluster abundance using the likelihood code 1 of Ref. [29] which roughly equates to a constraint on S 8 = σ 8 (Ω m /0.25) 0.47 = 0.813 ± 0.013. Note that the BAO data are added here not because they are in tension with Planck (they are not) but because they exclude resolutions of the H 0 tension involving exotic dark energy or curvature. To these we again add the Planck temperature, WMAP9 polarization and the ACT/SPT data sets. We call this the central-local (CL) Universe data set. Finally, we call the union of this with the EC data the ECL data set. These model and data choices are summarized in Tab. I.</p>

				<p>We analyze these data and models using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique and the CosmoMC code [19]. Our local analysis will be in many ways similar to that performed in Ref. [14] to which we refer the reader for details and robustness checks.</p>

				<head>II. RESULTS</head>

				<p>We begin by discussing the tension introduced by the BICEP2 data in the EC data set in the rΛCDM model and its alleviation in the νrΛCDM space independently of the CL data. In Fig. 1, we show the posterior probability distribution of the scalar-tensor ratio in these two models. In order to compare distributions with the quoted BICEP2 result of r 0.05 = 0.2</p>

				<p>−0.05 , we show results for the ratio at k = 0.05 Mpc −1 unlike the 0.002 Mpc −1 value assumed elsewhere. Note that in rΛCDM the C data set imply an upper limit of r 0.05 &lt; 0.1 consistent with the Planck collaboration analysis [2] but in tension with the E or BI- CEP2 data. Moving to the νrΛCDM space, constraints on r 0.05 weaken and allow r 0.05 = 0.2 within the 95% confidence limits.</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Fig. 2 we show the two dimensional r−∆N eff posterior for the EC data and the νrΛCDM model. Note in particular that r ∼ 0.2 would favor a fully populated ∆N eff ∼ 1 extra neutrino state, while ∆N eff = 0 is significantly disfavored (at 2.9σ once r is marginalized, see Tab. II). The origin of this preference is exposed by examining the n s −∆N eff plane in Fig. 3. Extra neutrino energy density at recombination allows a higher tilt and hence removes excess power in the low multipole temperature anisotropy. For example changing n s from 0.96 to 1 reduces the amount of power at k = 0.002 Mpc −1 relative to 0.05 Mpc −1 by 0.88, a reduction comparable to the amount of temperature power added by tensors when r = 0.2. This change simultaneously relaxes the CMB-ΛCDM upper bound on H 0 , as can be seen in Fig. 4. Extra neutrino energy density at recombination changes the amount of time sound waves propagate in the CMBbaryon plasma and hence the standard ruler for CMB and BAO distance measures. Note that the EC data set does not incorporate late Universe measurements of H 0 or S 8 . It is therefore interesting to compare the posterior probability of these FIG. 1. BICEP2 measurement of the tensor-scalar ratio r 0.05 (bands) compared with the posterior probability distribution of the C data set in the rΛCDM model space (black curve) and νrΛCDM space (red curve). In the former, the measurement is in strong tension with the posteriors whereas the addition of massive sterile neutrinos in the latter allows high r. For both the curves and the band, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is evaluated at a pivot scale of k = 0.05Mpc −1 unlike elsewhere. parameters with the actual measurements before combining them into a joint likelihood. In Fig. 5, we show these distributions from the νrΛCDM-EC analysis. Predictions for H 0 in this model context are now fully compatible with measurements (bands) and correspond to 0.74 ± 0.04. The addition of tensors shifts the distribution to higher H 0 as compared with neutrinos alone (cf. [14]). The predicted value of the cluster observable is S 8 = 0.89 ± 0.03, so residual tension remains – albeit slightly less tension than with neutrinos alone. However, this posterior can accommodate the local observations within the 95% confidence range. This tension can be further reduced if there is a 9% upward shift in the mass calibration of clusters, which is currently allowed [29]. Likewise it is instructive to review the local tension FIG. 2. Early Universe tension and neutrinos. In the νrΛCDM parameter space the EC data set favors ∆N eff &gt; 0 in order to offset the excess large angle temperature anisotropy implied by the high tensor-scalar ratio r (68%, 95% contours here and below). This in turn is driven by the degeneracy between ∆N eff and ns illustrated in Fig. 3. In brief, gravitational waves add power at low ℓ, requiring larger ns to compensate. Larger ns then requires larger ∆N eff to agree with the higher-ℓ CMB. FIG. 3</p>

Without tensors the C component of the CL data set places an upper limit on ∆N eff that disfavors ∆N eff = 1. Thus the Hubble constant inferred is h = 0.70 ± 0.01, which is consistent with measurements but on the low side. Meanwhile, the clus- FIG. 4. By allowing for tensors and neutrinos, the EC data set in the νrΛCDM model favors higher values for H 0 . Note that the actual measurements of H 0 are not imposed here as a prior – the BICEP2 central value of r in νrΛCDM predicts an H 0 in concordance with observations. ter abundance data in the CL data set dominates the mass constraint. Note that we do not consider the impact of systematic errors on the determination of cluster masses here. In Ref. [14], it was shown that the preference for a large m s would only be eliminated if the masses are underestimated by ∼ 30% which is large compared with the 9% uncertainty quoted in Ref. [29]. The full list of parameter constraints is given in Tab. II.</p>

				<p>Finally we consider the combined early and late Universe (ECL) data sets in the full νrΛCDM parameter space. By including tensors in the model, we again both enable a larger N eff and simultaneously fit the tensor results of BICEP2 and H 0 measurements. We find that the preference for an extra massive neutrino has increased in the joint data over the CL case, especially for ∆N eff . As shown in Fig. 7 and Tab. II, ∆N eff = 0.98 ± 0.26 and m s = 0.52 ± 0.13 eV or 3.8σ and 4σ evidence respectively . In particular, adding tensors closes off solutions FIG. 5. H 0 and S 8 posterior probability distributions in the νrΛCDM parameter space using early Universe (EC) data alone compared with the late Universe measurements. To emphasize, the black 1D posteriors plotted here have been derived without any use of local Universe data. The addition of neutrinos and tensors makes the H 0 posterior fully compatible with measurements (bands) and S 8 substantially more compatible, though some residual tension remains. The dotted line represents the shift in the central value of the cluster abundance measurements under the assumption of a 9% systematic increase in cluster masses. where H 0 is altered by adding energy density at recombination through m s at ∆N eff → 0 (cf. Figs. 6, 7). In addition, the distribution of the helium fraction for this combined data set is consistent with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis measurements (see Fig. 9). These conclusions could weaken if there were systematic problems in the cluster abundance measurements (as suggested, for example, by Ref. [30]), H 0 measurements [31] or in the small-scale CMB data [32]. Ref. [33] emphasizes that the tension between CMB + BAO data and the cluster measurements is not fully resolved by neutrinos, consistent with Fig. 5, and interpret this as an indication that the cluster data is not robust. Even without the cluster data, the neutrino solution is favored in order to satisfy H 0 , BAO and BICEP2 data simultaneously with the C data. In fact it is the agreement FIG. 6. Local Universe tension and neutrinos. The CL data set in the νΛCDM parameter space strongly disfavors the minimal neutrino model with ∆N eff =0 and ms = 0. This agrees with Ref. [14–16], and comes about because local H 0 measurements and local cluster abundance measurements add coherently in the direction of preferring new neutrino physics. Note that the line at ms = 10(∆N eff ) 3/4 eV represents the prior on the physical mass. FIG. 7. Joint evidence for sterile massive neutrino in the combined ECL data set and νrΛCDM model. The minimal neutrino model of ∆N eff = 0, ms = 0, is rejected at even higher confidence than in the CL-νrΛCDM combination and more strongly favors ∆N eff &gt; 0 (cf. Fig. 6). Note also that the same prior on ms vs. ∆N eff has been imposed here as in Fig. 6; we do not shade the excluded region since these contours have not been distorted by this prior. with BAO that make the single biggest contribution to the likelihood improvement from neutrinos (see Tab. III) and what is limiting the neutrino explanation is mainly a small tension with SPT/ACT. Furthermore compared with the ΛCDM model that best fits the C data alone, the νrΛCDM maximum likelihood model is actually a better fit to the BAO data itself and improves H 0 agreement by 2∆ ln L ≈ 6.2. The net improvement in maximum like- FIG. 8. Inflationary implications from the combined ECL data set and νrΛCDM model.

				<p>We close with a brief mention of the inflationary consequences of our analysis. In our final analysis, we find n s ∼ 1 and r ∼ 0.2. Such models are allowed within the framework of slow roll inflation since they do not have a large running of the tilt. However, they fall outside the class of simple featureless monomial potentials (see Fig. 8). To achieve nearly exact scale invariance, an inflationary potential must have its slope and curvature partially cancel in their effect on the tilt, a less typical situation. There is a relative dearth of such models in the literature (see e.g. [35]), although predictions for such models can be found, for example, in Refs. [36–38].</p>

				<head>III. DISCUSSION</head>

				<p>We have shown that the tension introduced by the detection of large amplitude gravitational wave power FIG. 9. Distribution of the helium fraction for the combined ECL data set and νrΛCDM model compared with the BBN measurements (band) [34]. by the BICEP2 experiment with temperature anisotropy measurements is alleviated in a model with an extra sterile neutrino. The relativistic energy density required to alleviate this early Universe tension is the same as that required to resolve the late Universe tension of acoustic distance measures with local Hubble constant measurements . Combined they imply a ∆N eff = 0.98 ± 0.26. Note that the ACT/SPT data already limit the upper range of allowed ∆N eff , and so this explanation of the early and late Universe tensions can be tested with more data from high multipole CMB temperature and polarization observations . Conversely, it would weaken if extra evidence for alternate inflationary or foreground explanations of the early Universe tension is found. By making the sterile neutrino massive, the tension with growth of structure measurements can simultaneously be alleviated. The combined constraint on the effective mass is m s = 0.52 ± 0.13 eV. This preference for high neutrino mass(es) is mainly driven by the cluster data set (cf. Ref. [39] who find upper limits without clusters). Compared with analyses that do not include gravitational waves, the sterile neutrino suggested here has a smaller expected physical mass, thanks to the generally larger values of ∆N eff that we find (recall the thermal conversion formula: m th s = m s /(∆N eff ) 3/4 ). At the upper range of ∆N eff , it is thus somewhat less likely that this sterile neutrino could explain anomalies in short baseline and reactor neutrino experiments (see Refs. [40, 41] for reviews). If future data or analyses lead to increased mass estimates for the clusters, that change would weaken the preference for a non-zero m s by increasing S 8 , giving better concordance with the basic ΛCDM prediction. However , the preference can only be eliminated if the systematic shift is roughly triple the 9% estimate; that estimate is derived from comparisons of a variety of X-ray, optical, Sunyaev-Zel&apos;dovich, and lensing observables (see e.g. [42] for a recent assessment). Taken at face value, these results leave us with a potentially very different cosmological standard model. Gravitational waves are nearly indisputable evidence for an inflationary epoch, but the lack of a significant primordial tilt compared with r would suggest somewhat unusual inflationary physics is at play where the impact of the slope and curvature of the inflationary potential partially cancelled each other. On the other hand, the new neutrino physics favored here is less contrived than that proposed in Ref. [14–16]: we are now allowed ∆N eff = 1, which is in better accord with a &quot; theory prior &quot; that the sterile neutrino would be fully populated by oscillations with active neutrinos for typical mixing angles. Meanwhile , we see somewhat less residual tension between the early and late Universe, especially if galaxy clusters are indeed a bit more massive than we have assumed in our main analysis.</p>

More recent studies of the cluster abundance indicate that this may somewhat underestimate the neutrino mass at least at lower masses than considered here [28] where the abundance follows the cold dark matter power spectrum more closely. We continue to adopt this approach to be conservative with respect to new neutrino physics and provide a continuous limit with CDM at high ms.</note>
