				<p>Light-front dynamics (LFD) is a powerful approach to the theory of relativistic composite systems (hadrons in the quark models and relativistic nucleons in nuclei). Its explicitly covariant version [1] has been recently applied with success [2] to describe the new CE- BAF/TJNAF data on the deuteron electromagnetic form factors. The solutions used in [2] were however not obtained from solving exactly the LFD equations but by means of a perturbative calculation with respect to the non relativistic wave function. Since, a consequent effort has been made to obtain exact solutions of LFD equations. The first results concerning J = 0 states in a scalar model have been published in [3]. The construction of J = 0 states in LFD is complicated by the two following facts. First, the generators of the spatial rotations contain interaction and are thus difficult to handle.

In the standard approach, with the light-front plane defined as t + z = 0, this violation of rotational invariance manifests by the fact that the energy depends on the angular momentum projection on z-axis [4]. We present here a method to construct J = 0 states in the explicitly covariant formulation of LFD and show how it leads to a restoration of rotational invariance. In this approach [1] the equation for relativistic two-body bound state wave function ψ reads:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>[4( k 2 + m 2 ) − M 2 ]ψ( k, ˆ n) = − m 2 2π 3 d 3 k ′ ε k ′ V ( k, k ′ , ˆ n, M 2 )ψ( k ′ , ˆ n), (1)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where V is the interaction kernel, ˆ n the three-dimensional unit vector determining the orientation of the light-front plane, M the total mass of the system and ε k = m 2 + k 2 .</p>

				<p>In general, the wave function depends both on the relative momentum k and n. In order to solve the problem, we replace the dynamical angular momentum operator by the kinematical one: J = −i[ k × ∂/∂ k ] − i[ˆ n × ∂/∂ˆ The eigenstates of J 2 are constructed from vectors k, ˆ n – taken on equal ground – by using the standard techniques of angular momentum theory. It turns out that the kernel and J commute not only with each other, but also with the operator A 2 = (ˆ n · J) 2 . Hence, the solutions of (1) are labelled by their mass, angular momentum and projection on z-axis, but also by the eigenvalues a 2 = 0, 1, . . . , J 2 of A 2 . In a truncated Fock space, the states with different a correspond to different masses M a . In the J π = 1 − case for instance, the solutions ψ a with a = 0, 1 can be written in the form:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ψ a ( k, ˆ n) = χ a ( ˆ k, ˆ n)g a (k, z), where χ a are the normalized eigenfunctions of the operator A 2 : A 2 χ a ( ˆ k, ˆ n) = a 2 χ a ( ˆ k, ˆ n), χ 0 ( ˆ k, ˆ n) = 3zˆ k, ˆ n) = 3 √ 2 2 ( ˆ k − zˆ z = ˆ k · ˆ n and functions g a satisfy the equations [4( k 2 + m 2 ) − M 2 0 ]zg 0 (k, z) = − m 2 2π 3 d 3 k ′ ε k ′ V ( k, k ′ , ˆ n, M 2 0 )z ′ g 0 (k ′ , z ′ ), [4( k 2 + m 2 ) − M 2 1 ](1 − z 2 )g 1 (k, z) = − m 2 2π 3 d 3 k ′ ε k ′ V ( k, k ′ , ˆ n, M 2 1 )( ˆ k · ˆ k ′ − zz ′ )g 1 (k ′ , z ′ ). obtained by inserting ψ 0,1 into (1). As mentioned above, due to the Fock space truncation, the masses M 0,1</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>determined in this way differ from each other. The key point of our method is based on the fact that, in order to ensure the equivalence between the dynamical angular momentum operator and the kinematical one (2), the physical state has to satisfy the so called angular condition [5]. This condition imposes the physical wave function to be a superposition of eigenstates of A 2 :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ψ( k, ˆ n) = a c a ψ a ( k, ˆ n) = c 0 χ 0 ( ˆ k, ˆ n)g 0 (k, z) + c 1 χ 1 ( ˆ k, ˆ n)g 1 (k, z) (3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The unknown coefficients are in principle determined by the angular condition itself but they can be unambiguously fixed by imposing that in the limit k → 0, the solution does not depend on n. The corresponding mass is then given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M 2 = a c 2 a M 2 a . (4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The validity of this solution has been checked in the Wick-Cutkosky model, i.e. for two scalar particles interacting by a massless scalar exchange. For J = 1 − state, the values of M a , M given by (4) and the mass of the 2s states are shown in Figure (a) as functions of the coupling constant α. One can see that despite the big split between M 0 and M 1 , M for the 1p state is very close to the mass of the 2s one, which in its turn is very close to the results obtained by solving Bethe-Salpeter equation (denoted by dots). The curves for M (solid line) and the 2s mass (long-dashed line) are hardly distinguishable. This means that our solution restores quite accurately the 2s-1p degeneracy of the relativistic Coulomb problem which in the Bethe-Salpeter approach is an exact result. The same situation also takes place in Figure (b) for 3s-2p states. It is worth noticing that in the whole range of coupling constants considered – implying large binding energies – the coefficients c 0,1 are very close to 1/3 and 2/3. To summarize, we emphasize that the physical state (3) is found as a superposition of non physical solutions ψ a . In the exact case, these solutions would be degenerated, but they are split in a truncated Fock space due to the effective violation of rotational invariance. Taking as a solution a superposition satisfying the angular condition – in spite of the mass split, we restore the general properties of the wave function, violated by the truncation of the Fock space. This solution, which fulfills the correct transformation laws under rotation, approaches the exact one. Our method thus provides a high accuracy solution of the relativistic two-body problem.</p>
