				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Field-antifield formalism [1, 2], summarizing numerous attempts to find correct quantization rules for various types of gauge models [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], is a powerful covariant quantization method which can be applied to arbitrary gauge invariant systems. This method is based on fundamental principle of BRST invariance [8, 9] and has a rich new geometry [10]. One of the most important objects of the field-antifield formalism is an odd symplectic structure called antibracket and known to mathematicians as Buttin bracket [11]. In terms of antibracket the master equation and the Ward identity for generating functional of vertex functions (effective action) are formulated. It is an important property that the antibracket is preserved under the anticanonical transformations which are dual to canonical transformations for a Poisson bracket. An important role and rich geometric possibilities of general anticanonical transformations in the field-antifield formalism have been realized in the procedure of gauge fixing [12] (see, also [13]). Original procedure of gauge fixing [1, 2] corresponds in fact to a special type of anticanonical transformation in an action being a proper solution to the quantum master equation . That type of transformations is capable to yield admissible gauge-fixing conditions in the form of equations of arbitrary Lagrangian surfaces (constraints in the antibracket involution) in the field-antifield phase space. Thereby, the necessary class of admissible gauges was involved actually. The latter made it possible to describe in [12] the structure and renormalization of general gauge theories in terms of anticanonical transformations. As the authors [12] assumed the use of regularizations in which δ(0) = 0 in local field theories, they based on the use of general anticanonical transformations in an action being a proper solution to the classical master equation. In turn, the gauge dependence and the structure of renormalization of the effective action have been analyzed by using infinitesimal anticanonical transformations only.</p>

				<p>In the present article, we extend the use of anticanonical transformations in the field-antifield formalism from the infinitesimal level to the finite one, and explore a gauge fixing procedure for general gauge theories, based on arbitrary anticanonical transformations in an action being a proper solution to the quantum master equation with fixed boundary condition. Now, it is worthy to notice the difference between the properties of the classical and quantum master equations under anticanonical transformations. The classical master equation is covariant under anticanonical transformations, as its left-hand side is the antibracket of the action with itself. In contrast to that, the form of the quantum master equation is not maintained under anticanonical transformations. One should accompany the anticanonical transformation by multiplying the exponential of i/ times the transformed action with the square root of the superjacobian of that anticanonical transformation. We will call such an operation for an anticanonical master transformation and the corresponding action for a master transformed action. Thus, one can say that the form of the quantum master equation is maintained under the anticanonical master transformation. We consider in all details the relationship between the two descriptions (in terms of the generating functions and the generators) for arbitrary finite anticanonical transformations.</p>

				<p>Finally, let us notice the study [14], among the other recent developments, where it was found a procedure to connect generating functionals of Green functions for a gauge system formulated in any two admissible gauges with the help of finite field-dependent BRST trans- formations.</p>

				<head n="2">Field-Antifield Formalism</head>

				<p>The starting point of the field-antifield formalism [1] is a theory of fields {A} for which the initial classical action S 0 (A) is assumed to be invariant under the gauge transformations δA = R(A)ξ. Here ξ are arbitrary functions of space-time coordinates , and {R(A)} are generators of gauge transformations. The set of generators is complete but, in general, maybe reducible and forms an open gauge algebra so that one works with general gauge theories. Here we do not discuss these points, referring to original papers [1, 2]. The structure of the gauge algebra determines necessary content of total configuration space of fields {ϕ i (ε(ϕ i ) = ε i )} involving fields {A} of initial classical system, ghost and antighost fields, auxiliary fields and , in case of reducible generators, pyramids of extra ghost and antighost fields as well as pyramids of extra auxiliary fields. To each field ϕ i one introduces an antifield ϕ * i , whose statistics is opposite to that of the corresponding fields ϕ i , ε(ϕ * i ) = ε i + 1. On the space of the fields ϕ i and antifields ϕ * i one defines an odd symplectic structure ( , ) called the antibracket</p>

					<trash>(J, ϕ * ) and W (J, ϕ * ) defined by the relations Z(J, ϕ * ) = Dϕ exp i S(ϕ, ϕ * ) + J i ϕ i = exp i W (J, ϕ * ) (2.12) where S(ϕ, ϕ * ) = S ϕ, ϕ * + ∂ ϕ ψ(ϕ) . (2.13) Obviously, we have Z(J) = Z(J, ϕ * ) | ϕ * =0 , W (J) = W (J, ϕ * ) | ϕ * =0 . (2.14) The action S = S(ϕ, ϕ * ) (2.13) satisfies the quantum master equation 1 2 (S, S) = i∆S ⇔ ∆ exp i S = 0. (2.15) It follows from (2.15) that the Ward identities hold for the extended generating functionals Z(J, ϕ * ) and W (J, ϕ * ) J i ∂ ϕ * i Z(J, ϕ * ) = 0 , J i ∂ ϕ * i W (J, ϕ * ) = 0. (2.16) Indeed, we have 0 = dϕ exp i Jϕ ∆ exp i S = dϕ(−1) ε i ∂ ϕ i exp i Jϕ ∂ ϕ * i exp i S − − i J i ∂ ϕ * i dϕ exp i (S + Jϕ) = − i J i ∂ ϕ * i Z(J, ϕ * ) = = − i J i ∂ ϕ * i exp i W (ϕ * , J) =⇒ J i ∂ ϕ * i W (ϕ * , J) = 0.

(2.19) It follows from (2.17) and (2.19) that the Ward identity for the effective action holds, Γ ← − ∂ ϕ i ∂ ϕ * i Γ = 0 =⇒ 1 2 (Γ, Γ) = 0, (2.20)</trash>

				<p>As it was pointed out for the first time in [12], the gauge fixing procedure in the field-antifield formalism (2.13) can be described in terms of a special type of anticanonical transformation (2.9). Indeed, let us consider anticanonical transformations of the variables (ϕ, ϕ</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>* ) with specific generating function Y = Y (ϕ, Φ * ) = Φ * i ϕ i − ψ(ϕ). (2.21) We have Φ i = ϕ i , ϕ * i = Φ * i − ∂ ϕ i ψ(ϕ), (2.22) so that the transformed actioñ S = ˜ S(ϕ, ϕ * ) ˜ S(ϕ, ϕ * ) = S(Φ, Φ * ) = S(ϕ, ϕ * + ∂ ϕ ψ(ϕ)) (2.23) coincides with (2.13).</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In particular, this fact made it possible to study effectively the gauge dependence and structure of renormalization of general gauge theories [12]. In what follows we explore a gauge fixing procedure in the field-antifield formalism as an anticanonical transformation of general type with the only requirement for anticanonically generalized action: supermatrix of second field derivatives of this action must be non-degenerate. An essential difference in this point with the approach used in [12] is that we work with general setting for an action (2.13) which satisfies the quantum master equation (not the classical master equation as in [12]).</p>

(3.4) The anticanonically transformed actioñ S, ˜ S = ˜ S(ϕ, ϕ * ) = S(Φ, Φ * ) = S + (S, X) + O(X 2 ) (3.5) does not satisfy the quantum master equation to the first approximation in X, 1 2 ( ˜ S, ˜ S) − i∆ S = i(S, ∆X) + O(X 2 ) = 0. (3.6) Consider now the superdeterminant of the anticanonical transformation J (ϕ, ϕ * ) = J (Z) = sDet ¯ Z A (Z) ← − ∂ B , (3.7) where ¯ Z A = (Φ i , Φ * i ), Z A = (ϕ i , ϕ * i ), ∂ A = ∂ ∂Z A . (3.8) To the first order approximation in X, the J reads J = exp{2∆X} + O(X 2 ) = exp i − 2i∆X + O(X 2 ). (3.9)</trash>

The action S ′ (3.10) to the first order in X S ′ = S + (S, X) − i∆X + O(X 2 ) (3.13) does satisfy the quantum master equation 1 2 (S ′ , S ′ ) − i∆S ′ = O(X 2 ). (3.14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that, due to the results of [17, 18], the action (3.10) by itself satisfies the quantum master equation in the case of arbitrary anticanonical transformation, as well (see, also [19, 13]).</p>

				<p>Let us consider the generating functionals constructed with the help of master-transformed action S ′ to the first order in X.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>We have Z ′ = Z ′ (J, ϕ * ) = dϕ exp i (S ′ + Jϕ) = exp i W ′ (J, ϕ * ) = = exp i W (J, ϕ * ) 1 + i δW (J, ϕ * ) , (3.15) Γ ′ (ϕ, ϕ * ) = W ′ (J, ϕ * ) − Jϕ = Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ) + δΓ(ϕ, ϕ * ), (3.16) δΓ(ϕ, ϕ * ) = δW (J(ϕ, ϕ * ), ϕ * ). Therefore Z ′ − Z = δZ = i exp i W (J, ϕ * ) δW (J, ϕ * ) = = i exp i W (J, ϕ * ) δΓ(ϕ, ϕ * ) = = i dϕ [(S, X) − i∆X] exp i (S + Jϕ) = = dϕ exp i Jϕ ∆ X exp i S = = − i J i ∂ ϕ * i ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) exp i W (J, ϕ * ) = = exp i W (J, ϕ * ) − i J i ∂ ϕ * i ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) , (3.17) where ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) = exp − i W (J, ϕ * ) dϕX exp i (S + Jϕ) . (3.18) When deriving (3.17), the Ward identity for W (J, ϕ * ) (2.17), the quantum master equation for S(ϕ, ϕ * ) (2.15) and the following identities i exp i S ∆X = i∆ X exp i S + (S, X) exp i S , (3.19) exp i Jϕ ∆ X exp i S = (−1) ε i ∂ ϕ i exp i Jϕ ∂ ϕ * i Xe i S − − i J i ∂ ϕ * i X exp i (S + Jϕ) (3.20) are used. Rewriting (3.17) for a variation of the effective action Γ = Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ), we obtain δΓ(ϕ, ϕ * ) = −J i ∂ ϕ * i ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) = (−1) ε i Γ i ∂ ϕ * i X (ϕ, ϕ * ) − −(−1) ε i Γ i ∂ ϕ * i J j (ϕ, ϕ * ) ∂ J j ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) J=J(ϕ,ϕ * ) , (3.21) where X (ϕ, ϕ * ) = ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) J=J(ϕ,ϕ * ) . (3.22) One can rewrite the equation (3.21) in terms of Γ = Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ) as δΓ(ϕ, ϕ * ) = Γ ← − ∂ ϕ i ∂ ϕ * i X − Γ ← − ∂ ϕ * i ∂ ϕ i X = (Γ, X ) = −(X , Γ). (3.23)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This result is proved in Appendix A. The equation (3.23) means that any infinitesimal anticanonical master transformation of the action S (3.5) with a generating functional X induces an infinitesimal anticanonical transformation in the effective action Γ (3.23) with a generating functional X , provided the generating functional of Green functions is constructed via the master-transformed action. An important goal of our present study is a generalization of this fact (for the first time known among results of paper [12]) to the case of arbitrary (finite) anticanonical transformation.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>4 Finite anticanonical transformation Consider an arbitrary (finite) anticanonical transformation described by a generating functional Y = Y (ϕ, Φ * ), ε(Y ) = 1, 5 ϕ * i = Y (ϕ, Φ * ) ← − ∂ ϕ i , Φ A = ∂ Φ * i Y (ϕ, Φ * ). (4.1) Let Y has the form Y (ϕ, Φ * ) = Φ * i ϕ i + af (ϕ, Φ * ), ε(f (ϕ, Φ * )) = 1, (4.2) where a is a parameter. Then solution of equations (4.1) up to second order in a can be written as Φ i = ϕ i + af ← − ∂ ϕ * i − a 2 (−1) (ε i +1)(ε j +1) f ← − ∂ ϕ * j ← − ∂ ϕ * i − → ∂ ϕ j f + O(a 3 ), (4.3) Φ * i = ϕ * i − a∂ ϕ i f + a 2 (−1) ε i (ε j +1) f ← − ∂ ϕ * j ← − ∂ ϕ i − → ∂ ϕ j f + O(a 3 ), (4.4) where f ≡ f (ϕ, ϕ * ). Let us denote Z A = {ϕ i , ϕ * i }, ¯ Z A = {Φ i , Φ * i }, ε( ¯ Z A ) = ε(Z A ) = ε A , (4.5) and F = F (ϕ, ϕ * ; a) = −f (ϕ, ϕ * ) + a 2 f (ϕ, ϕ * ) ← − ∂ ϕ * j − → ∂ ϕ j f (ϕ, ϕ * ). (4.6) Then we have ¯ Z A = ¯ Z A (Z; a) = exp{aad(F )}Z A + O(a 3 ), (4.7) where ad(F ) means the left adjoint of the antibracket ad(F )(...) = (F (Z; a), (...)). (4.8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We call F in (4.6) for a generator of anticanonical transformation to the second order. It should be noticed that the generator of anticanonical transformation does not coincide with the generating functional of this transformation already to the second order. A natural question arises: Does a generator exist for a given anticanonical transformation, actually? To answer this question, we begin with the claim that an operator exp{ad(F )} generates anticanonical transformation. Indeed, let Z A be anticanonical variables so that the antibracket (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>2.1) can be presented in the form (H(Z), G(Z)) = H(Z) ← − ∂ A E AB − → ∂ B G(Z), (Z A , Z B ) = E AB , ∂ A = ∂ ∂Z A , (4.9) where E AB is a constant supermatrix with the properties E BA = −(−1) (ε A +1)(ε B +1) E AB , ε(E AB ) = ε A + ε B + 1. (4.10) Then the transformation Z A → ¯ Z A (Z) = exp{adF (Z)}Z A (4.11) is anticanonical, ( ¯ Z A (Z), ¯ Z B (Z)) = ¯ Z A (Z) ← − ∂ C E CD − → ∂ D ¯ Z B (Z) = E AB . (4.12) To prove this fact we introduce an one-parameter family of transformations ¯ Z A (Z, a) = exp{aad(F )}Z A , ¯ Z A (Z, 0) = Z A , (4.13) and quantities ¯ Z AB (Z, a), ¯ Z AB (Z, a) = ( ¯ Z A (Z, a), ¯ Z B (Z, a)), ¯ Z AB (Z, 0) = E AB . (4.14) It follows from the definitions (4.13), (4.14), that the relations d da ¯ Z A (Z, a) = (F (Z), ¯ Z A (Z, a)), (4.15) d da ¯ Z AB (Z, a) = ((F (Z), ¯ Z A (Z, a)), ¯ Z B (Z, a)) + ( ¯ Z A (Z, a), (F (Z), ¯ Z B (Z, a)) = = (F (Z), ( ¯ Z A (Z, a), ¯ Z B (Z, a)) = (F (Z), ¯ Z AB (Z, a)) = ad(F (Z)) ¯ Z AB (Z, a), (4.16) hold, where the Jacobi identity (2.7) for antibrackets is used. A solution to the equation (4.16) has the form ¯ Z AB (Z, a) = exp{aad(F (Z))} ¯ Z AB (Z, 0) = exp{aad(F (Z))}E AB = E AB , (4.17) and</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>the transformation (4.11) is really anticanonical. An inverse to this statement is valid as well: an arbitrary set of anticanonical variables ¯ Z A (Z) can be presented in the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>¯ Z A (Z) = exp{ad(F (Z))}Z A (4.18) with some generator functional F (Z), ε(F (Z)) = 1. In Appendix B, a proof of this fact is given. Consider now a master-transformed action S ′ = S ′ (ϕ, ϕ * ) (3.10). It was pointed out in [14]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>that there are presentations of S</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>′ in the following forms exp i S ′ = exp{−[F, ∆]} exp i S , (4.19) or S ′ = exp{ad(F )}S + if (ad(F ))∆F, (4.20) where S = S(ϕ, ϕ * ), and F = F (ϕ, ϕ * ) is a generator functional of an anticanonical transformation , f (x) = (exp(x) − 1)x −1 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In accordance with (3.10), the first term in the right-hand side in (4.20) describes an anticanonical transformation of S with an odd generator functional F , while the second term is a half of a logarithm of the Jacobian (3.7) of that transformation, up to (−i). In Appendix D, we give a proof of the latter statement.</p>

Constructed generating functionals (4.21) obey very important property of independence of F for physical quantities on-shell. 6 Indeed, for infinitesimal δF the variation of Z ′ (4.21), δZ ′ = − i dϕ[(S, δF ) − i(∆δF )] exp i (S(ϕ, ϕ * ) + Jϕ) = = i J A ∂ ϕ * A δ ˜ F (J, ϕ * ) exp i W (J, ϕ * ) , (4.22)</trash>

In deriving (4.22), the results of calculation (3.17) is used and the notation δ ˜ F (J, ϕ * ) = Z −1 (J, ϕ * ) dϕ δF (ϕ, ϕ * ) exp i (S(ϕ, ϕ * ) + Jϕ) (4.23) is introduced. In the case of finite anticanonical transformations, we consider the following anticanonically generalized action S ′′ exp i S ′′ (ϕ, ϕ * ) = exp{−[F (ϕ, ϕ * ) + δF (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆]} exp i S(ϕ, ϕ * ) , (4.24) where δF = δF (ϕ, ϕ * ) is an infinitesimal functional. The following representation holds exp{−[F (ϕ, ϕ * ) + δF (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆]} = exp{−[δF (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆]} exp{−[F (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆]}, (4.25) where δF (ϕ, ϕ * ) is defined by the relation exp{−ad(F (ϕ, ϕ * )) − ad(δF (ϕ, ϕ * ))} exp{−ad(F (ϕ, ϕ * ))} = exp{−ad(δF (ϕ, ϕ * ))}. (4.26) In Appendix C, a proof of relations (4.25), (4.26) is given. Due to (4.25), we can present the action S ′′ in the form exp i S ′′ (ϕ, ϕ * ) = exp{−[δF (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆]} exp i S ′ (ϕ, ϕ * ) .

				<p>Although we need here of infinitesimal functional δF (ϕ, ϕ * ) but the representation (4.27) by itself is valid for arbitrary functional δF . In turn, the representation (4.27) allows us for the use of previous reasons concerning the case of infinitesimal anticanonical transformations and for the statement that the generating functionals Z ′′ and Z ′ constructed with the help of the actions S ′′ and S ′ , respectively, give the same physical results.</p>

(4.30) Taking into account (3.17) and (4.29), we derive the relation ∂ a Z ′ (a) = i Z ′ (a)∂ a W ′ (J, ϕ * ; a) = i Z ′ (a)∂ a Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ; a) = = − dϕ exp i Jϕ [F (ϕ, ϕ * ), ∆] exp i S ′ (ϕ, ϕ * ; a) = = − dϕ exp i Jϕ ∆ F (ϕ, ϕ * ) exp i S ′ (ϕ, ϕ * ; a) . (4.31) By repeating similar calculations which lead us from (3.17) to (3.23) due to relations (3.19), (3.20) and (A.1)-(A.7), we obtain ∂ a Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ; a) = (F (ϕ, ϕ * ; a), Γ(ϕ, ϕ * ; a)), (4.32) F (ϕ, ϕ * ; a) = 1 Z ′ (J, ϕ * ; a) d ˜ ϕF ( ˜ ϕ, ϕ * ) exp i (S ′ ( ˜ ϕ, ϕ * ; a) + J ˜ ϕ) J=J(ϕ,ϕ * ;a) .

(5.25) We set U n (a) = F [n|n] (a).

					<figDesc>By the same reasons used at the previous stages, we conclude that ad(F n+1 (a)) = − n a ad(F n|n (a)) + exp{−ad(F n|n (a))}ad(F n (a)) exp{ad(F n|n (a))} + O(a</figDesc>

					<figDesc>Finally, by applying the induction method, we obtain that a solution to the basic equation (5.2) can be presented in the form Γ(a) = exp{ad(U(a))}Γ, (5.34) which is nothing but an anticanonical transformation of Γ with a generator functional U(a) defined by functional F (a) in (5.2) as</figDesc>

				<p>In turn, the relation (5.36) can be considered as a new representation of the functional (4.33). Let us notice that the functional U(a) in (5.34) depends on the functional F (a) only, and does not depend on the choice of an initial data for Γ(a).

				<p>Let us state again that the dependence of the effective action on a finite anticanonical transformation with a generating functional Y (ϕ, Φ * ; a) is really described in terms of anticanonical transformation with a generator functional U(ϕ, ϕ * ; a). As an anticanonical transformation is</p>

				<p>a change of variables in Γ, in particular, it means that, on-shell, the effective action does not depend on gauges introducing with the help of anticanonical transformations.</p>

				<head n="6">Discussions</head>

				<p>In the present article, we have explored a conception of gauge fixing procedure in the fieldantifield formalism [1, 2], based on the use of anticanonical transformations of general type.</p>

				<p>The approach includes an action (master-transformed action) constructed with the help of anticanonical master transformation and being non-degenerate. The master-transformed action is a sum of two terms: one is an action subjected to an anticanonical transformation and the other is a term connecting with a logarithm of a superdeterminant of this anticanonical transformation . This action satisfies the quantum master equation [19, 13] (see, also Appendix D).</p>

				<p>Generating functionals of Green functions constructed via the master-transformed action obey the important property of the gauge independence of physical quantities on-shell, and satisfy the Ward identity. We have found that any (finite) anticanonical master transformation of an action leads to the corresponding anticanonical transformation of effective action (generating functional of vertex functions) provided the generating functional of Green functions is constructed with the help of anticanonical master action. We have proved the existence of a generator functional of an anticanonical transformation of the effective action. This result is essential when proving the independence of the effective action of anticanonical transformations on-shell and, on the other hand, it may supplement in a non-trivial manner the representation of anticanonical transformations in the form of a path-ordered exponential [13]</p>

(A.2) From the Ward identity (2.20) written in the form Γ i Γ i * = 0, Γ i * = Γ ← − ∂ ϕ * i , Γ i = ∂ ϕ i Γ, (A.3) it follows that the relations (−1) ε j ε k +ε k Γ k Γ k * j = (−1) ε j Γ k * Γ kj , Γ k * j = ∂ ϕ j ∂ ϕ * k Γ (A.4) hold. By taking these relations into account, we have (−1) ε k Γ k ∂ ϕ * k J j (ϕ, ϕ * ) = −(−1) ε j +ε k Γ k ∂ ϕ * k ∂ ϕ j Γ = = −(−1) ε j ε k +ε k Γ k Γ k * j = −(−1) ε j Γ k * Γ kj (A.5) and ∂ ϕ k X = ∂ ϕ k J j (ϕ, ϕ * ) ∂ J j ˜ X = −(−1) ε j Γ kj ∂ J j ˜ X =⇒ ∂ J j ˜ X(J, ϕ * ) J=J(ϕ,ϕ * ) = −(−1) ε j M jk ∂ ϕ k X (ϕ, ϕ * ).

(C.14) In deriving (C.13) and (C.14), the identities (C.7) and (C.8) are used.

				<head>Appendix D Master-transformed actions</head>

				<p>Here we present a set of properties concerning master-transformed actions.</p>

				<p>Firstly, we prove that an action S ′ constructed by the rule (4.19) from S, being a solution to the quantum master equation, satisfies the quantum master equation, as well. To do this, we consider a functional X(Z) and the transformation X</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(Z) → X ′ (Z) = X(Z, 1) of the form exp i X(Z, a) = exp − a[F (Z), ˆ ∆] exp i X(Z) , X(Z, 0) = X(Z). (D.1) The transformation (D.1) has the property: ∆ exp i X(Z) = 0 =⇒ ∆ exp i X(Z, a) = 0. (D.2) Indeed, let us introduce a functional Y (Z, a) = ∆ exp i X(Z, a) , Y (z, 0) = ∆ exp i X(Z) . (D.3) Then we have d da Y (Z, a) = − ˆ ∆ ([F (Z), ∆]) exp i X(Z, a) = − ˆ ∆F (Z)Y (Z, a) (D.4</trash>

					<figDesc>) where the nilpotency of ∆ operator is used. Integrating this equation gives</figDesc>
					<trash>Y (Z, a) = exp{−â ∆F (Z)}Y (Z, 0) =⇒ (D.5) ∆ exp i X(Z, a) = exp{−â ∆F (Z)}∆ exp i X(Z) . (D.6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Secondly, to prove the presentation of (4.20), we consider the relation (D.1) in more detail. Note that [F (</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>z), ∆] = (∆F (Z)) − ad(F (Z)), (D.7) and we have the following identification of (D.7) with the functions M(Z) and the operator N A (Z)∂ A from (C.23) M(Z) = −∆F (Z), N A (Z)∂ A = ad(F (Z)). (D.8) It follows from (C.31) that X ′ = exp{ad(F (Z))}X + if (ad(F (Z)))∆F. (D.9)</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In the right-hand side in (D.9), the first term is an anticanonical transformation with finite Fermionic generator F , while the second term is a half of a logarithm of the Jacobian of that transformation, up to (−i). It is obvious that the inverse statement holds as well: the validity of the relation (D.9) implies the equation (D.1).</p>

				<p>Now we show that an equality holds exp{−[F 2</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>(Z) + F 1 (Z), ∆]} = exp{−[F 2 (Z), ∆]} exp{−[F 1 (Z), ∆]}, (D.10) where F 2 (Z) is determined by the relation exp{[ad(F 2 (Z)) + ad(F 1 (Z))]} exp{−ad(F 1 (Z))} = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))}. (D.11) Existence of relations (D.10) and (D.11) means that transformations generated by exp{−[F (Z), ∆]} and exp{ad(F (Z))} obey a group property.</figDesc>
					<trash>Consider anticanonical transformations generated by Fermionic functions F 1 (Z), F 1 (Z) + F 2 (Z) and F 2 (Z) ¯ Z A 1 (Z) = exp{ad(F 1 (Z))}Z A , ¯ Z A 2 (Z) = exp{[ad(F 2 (Z)) + ad(F 1 (Z))]}Z A , (D.12) ¯ Z A 2 (Z) = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))}Z A . (D.13) Then, due to (D.11), we have ¯ Z A 2 (Z) = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))} exp{ad(F 1 (Z))}Z A = ¯ Z A 1 ( ¯ Z 2 (Z)), (D.14) For a given action S(Z), the relations S 1 (Z) = exp{ad(F 1 (Z))}S(Z) = S( ¯ Z 1 (Z)), (D.15) S 2 (Z) = exp{[ad(F 2 (Z)) + ad(F 1 (Z))]}S(Z) = S( ¯ Z 2 (Z)) = S( ¯ Z 1 ( ¯ Z 2 (Z)) = = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))}S 1 (Z) (D.16) hold.</trash>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>(Z) is defined by the first equality in (D.16), and ¯ Z A 2 is given by the second equality in (D.12). It follows from (D.17) and (D.18) that</figDesc>
					<trash>S ′ 2 (Z) = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))} S 1 (Z) − i 2 ln sDet ¯ Z A 1 (Z) ← − ∂ B − − i 2 ln sDet ¯ Z A 2 (Z) ← − ∂ B = = exp{ad(F 2 (Z))}S ′ 1 (Z) − i 2 ln sDet [ ¯ Z A 2 (Z) ← − ∂ B ], (D.19) where S ′ 1</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>is master transformed action S under anticanonical transformation of variables Z with the generator functional F 1 (Z), and, as a result, S ′ 2 is presented as master transformed action S ′ corresponding to the anticanonical master transformation of Z with generator functional F 2 , i.e., in the form of successive anticanonical master transformations.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>From (D.19) we deduce the relations exp{−[F 2 (z) + F 1 (Z), ∆]} exp i S(Z) = exp{−[F 2 (Z), ∆]} exp i S ′ 1 (Z) = = exp{−[F 2 (Z), ∆]} exp{−[F 1 (Z), ∆]} exp i S(Z) (D.20) being valid for arbitrary functional S(Z). The latter proves the relation (D.10). Finally, we give a proof of the relation 1 2 ln sDet ¯ Z A ← − ∂ B = −f (ad(F ))∆F, ¯ Z A = exp{ad(F )}Z A , (D.21)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>used in the representation of the master transformed actions (3.10) and (4.20). To do this, we introduce an one-parameter family of anticanonical transformations</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>¯ Z A (a) = exp{aad(F )}Z A , (D.22) and the corresponding set of logarithm of superdeterminants D(a) = ln sDet ¯ Z A (a) ← − ∂ B . (D.23) Consider anticanonical transformations with infinitesimal variation of parameter a ¯ Z A 2 = ¯ Z A (a + δa) = exp{(a + δa)ad(F )}Z A (D.24) and functionals D(a + δa) = ln sDet [ ¯ Z A 2 ← − ∂ B ] = ln sDet [ ¯ Z A (a + δa) ← − ∂ B ]. (D.25) Taking into account the relations (D.10), (D.11), (D.12) and (D.13), we have the following identification F 1 = aF, F 2 = δaF, F 2 = δaF (D.26) and the representations up to the second order in δa exp{ad(F ) 2 } = 1 + δaad(F ) + O((δa) 2 ), ¯ Z A 2 = Z A + δaF ← − ∂ C E CA + O((δa) 2 ), (D.27) ln sDet [ ¯ Z A 2 ← − ∂ B ] = δa sTr [F ← − ∂ C E CA ← − ∂ B ] + O((δa) 2 ) = −2δa∆F + O((δa) 2 ). (D.28) From (D.27), (D.28) and (D.17), it follows the differential equation for D(a), ∂ a D(a) = ad(F )D(a) − 2∆F, D(0) = 0. (D.29)</trash>

					<figDesc>Let us seek for a solution to this equation in the form</figDesc>
					<trash>D(a) = exp{aad(F )}D 1 (a), D 1 (0) = 0. (D.30) Then we obtain ∂ a D 1 (a) = −2 exp{−aad(F )}∆F, (D.31) and D 1 (a) = −2a exp{−aad(F )}f (aad(F ))∆F + C, C = D 1 (0) = 0. (D.32) Finally, we find D(a) = −2af (aad(F ))∆F, ln sDet ¯ Z A ← − ∂ B = D(1) = −2f (ad(F ))∆F. (D.33)</trash>

				<p>Appendix E Factorization of the Jacobian of anticanonical transfor- mation For the sake of completeness of our study of anticanonical transformations, let us present here a simple proof of the factorization property of the Grand Jacobian of an anticanonical transformation within the field-antifield formalism [1, 2]. The result was known at least since the article [18] of Batalin and Vilkovisky, although the proof was omitted therein.</p>

				<p>We will proceed with the use of antisymplectic Darboux coordinates Z A in the form of an explicit splitting into fields φ i and antifields φ</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>* i , Z A = {φ i , φ * i }, ε(Z A ) = ε A , ε(φ * i ) = ε(φ i ) + 1, (E.1) so that (Z A , Z B ) = E AB , ε(E AB ) = ε A + ε B + 1, (E.2) where E AB is a constant invertible antisymplectic metric with the following block structure E AB = 0 I −I 0 (E.3) and antisymmetry property E AB = −(−1) (ε A +1)(ε B +1) E BA . (E.4) Let F = F (Z) be a Fermion generator of an anticanonical transformation, Z A → ¯ Z A (t) = exp{tad(F )}Z A , ¯ Z A (t = 0) = Z A , ¯ Z A = {Φ i , Φ * i }. (E.5) ¯ Z A satisfies the Lie equation d dt ¯ Z A = ( ¯ F , ¯ Z A ) ¯ Z , (E.6) where ¯ F = F ( ¯ Z) = F (Z). Let us consider the (Grand) Jacobian, J(t), of the anticanonical transformation (E.5) J(t) = sDet ¯ Z A (t) ← − ∂ B , (E.7) together with its logarithm ln J(t) = sTr ln ¯ Z A (t) ← − ∂ B . (E.8) By using (E.6) and the relations ( ¯ Z A ← − ∂ C )(Z C ← − ∂ ¯ B ) = δ A B , (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )( ¯ Z C ← − ∂ B ) = δ A B , (E.9) which are valid for any invertible transformation Z A → ¯ Z A , together with the formula for a δ-variation, δ sTr ln M = sTr M −1 δM, (M −1 ) A C M C B = δ A B , (E.10) we derive the equation for ln J d dt ln J = sTr (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C ) d dt ( ¯ Z C ← − ∂ B ) = (−1) ε A (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )( ˙ ¯ Z C ← − ∂ A ) = = (−1) ε A (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )(( ¯ F , ¯ Z C ) ← − ∂ A ) = −(−1) ε C ( − → ∂ ¯ C Z A ) − → ∂ A ( ¯ Z C , ¯ F ) = = −(−1) ε C − → ∂ ¯ C ( ¯ Z C , ¯ F ) = −2 ¯ ∆ ¯ F , (E.11) where the operators ∆, ¯ ∆ are defined 7 by ∆ = ∆ Z = 1 2 (−1) ε A ∂ A (Z A , ...) = 1 2 (−1) ε A ∂ A E AB ∂ B , ¯ ∆ = ∆ ¯ Z = exp{ad(tF )}∆ exp{ad(−tF )}. (E.12) Here ∂ A and ∂ ¯ A denotes partial Z A -and ¯ Z A -derivative, respectively. Now, let J φ be the Jacobian in the sector of fields, J φ (t) = sDet Φ i (t, φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ j , (E.13) together with its logarithm, ln J φ (t) = sTr ln Φ i (t, φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ j , (E.14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where ∂ i denotes partial φ i -derivative. In what follows below, the symbols ∂¯ k and ∂ * ¯ k , with barred indices, will be used to denote partial Φ k -and Φ * k -derivatives, respectively. To get the t-derivative of ln J φ , one needs of an inverse to the matrix Φ i ← − ∂ j .</p>

				<p>Let us consider an anticanonical transformation in the sector of fields,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>φ i → Φ i = Φ i (t, φ, φ * ). (E.15) Let us resolve that equation for initial fields φ i , with t and φ * i kept fixed, φ i = φ i (t, Φ, φ * ), (E.16) so that φ i (t, Φ(t, φ, φ * ), φ * ) ≡ φ i . (E.17) 7</trash>

					<figDesc>Notice that in (E.11) we mean just the second equality (E.12) as to define the transformed operator ¯ ∆. That definition is maintained by the two following motivations : it respects both the nilpotency property, and the multiplicative composition ∆G = ¯ ∆ ¯ G, ¯ G = G( ¯ Z), with arbitrary function G = G(Z).</figDesc>
					<trash>It follows from (E.17) that the relation φ i (t, Φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ ¯ k Φ k (t, φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ j = δ i j , (E.18)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>holds, because of the initial fields φ i are inverse functions to Φ i (t, φ, φ * ) at the fixed values of t and φ * i . From now on, the variables Φ i , Φ * i are considered as functions of t, φ i , φ * i , while the fields φ i are functions of t, Φ i , φ * i , so that the short notation will be used naturally,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>φ i (t, Φ, φ * ) = φ i , Φ i (t, φ, φ * ) = Φ i , Φ * i (t, φ, φ * ) = Φ * i . (E.19) Now, we derive the following equation for ln J φ d dt ln J φ = − ¯ ∆ ¯ F − 1 2 (−1) ε k ¯ F ← − ∂ * ¯ k ← − ∂ * ¯ m (Φ * m ← − ∂ i )(φ i ← − ∂ ¯ k ) − (k ↔ m)(−1) ε k εm . (E.20) In turn, let us consider the quantity, T jk = (Φ * j ← − ∂ i )(φ i ← − ∂ ¯ k ) − (Φ * k ← − ∂ i )(φ i ← − ∂ ¯ j )(−1) ε j ε k . (E.21)</trash>

					<figDesc>Then, by multiplying (E.21) subsequently from the right by the two Jacobi matrices accompanied with a special sign factor, we have,</figDesc>
					<trash>T jk (Φ k ← − ∂ l )(Φ j ← − ∂ m )(−1) ε j ε l = ( − → ∂ l Φ * j )(Φ j ← − ∂ m ) − (m ↔ l)(−1) εmε l . (E.22)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The latter can be rewritten in the form,</figDesc>
					<trash>T jk (Φ k ← − ∂ l )(Φ j ← − ∂ m )(−1) ε j ε l = ( − → ∂ l Φ * j )(Φ j ← − ∂ m ) − ( − → ∂ l Φ j )(Φ * j ← − ∂ m ) (E.23) Now, let us introduce the quantity, L AB = ( − → ∂ A ¯ Z C )E CD ( ¯ Z D ← − ∂ B ) (E.24) where E AB is an inverse to E AB , with the following block structure, E AB = 0 −I I 0 , ε(E AB ) = ε A + ε B + 1 (E.25) and antisymmetry property E AB = −(−1) ε A ε B E BA . (E.26) Notice that the field-field components of (E.24), L ij = ( − → ∂ i Φ * k )(Φ k ← − ∂ j ) − ( − → ∂ j Φ k )(Φ * k ← − ∂ i ), (E.27) do coincide with (E.23). By taking the relation (Z A , Z B ) ¯ Z = (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )E CD ( − → ∂ ¯ D Z B ) = E AB (E.28) into account, we have E AC L CB = (Z A , Z C ) ¯ Z L CB = (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )E CD ( − → ∂ ¯ D Z E )( − → ∂ E ¯ Z F )E F G ( ¯ Z G ← − ∂ B ) = = (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )E CD δ F D E F G ( ¯ Z G ← − ∂ B ) = (Z A ← − ∂ ¯ C )( ¯ Z C ← − ∂ B ) = δ A B . (E.29) The latter implies 8 L AB = E AB , L ij = 0. (E.30)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Thus, we obtain the equation for the Jacobian J φ in the sector of fields,</figDesc>
					<trash>d dt ln J φ = − ¯ ∆ ¯ F . (E.31) In the same way, we derive the equation d dt ln J φ * = − ¯ ∆ ¯ F (E.32) for the Jacobian J φ * in the sector of antifields, J φ * (t) = sDet Φ * i (t, φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ * j , ln J φ * (t) = sTr ln Φ * i (t, φ, φ * ) ← − ∂ * j . (E.33) It follows from (E.11), the initial data (E.5), (E.31) and (E.32), that J φ = J φ * = J 1/2 , (E.34) and finally, the factorization property, J = J φ J φ * . (E.35)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>It seems to be rather useful to mention here the main properties of the Grand Jacobian J of anticanonical transformations, within the field-antifield formalism. Let Z A → ¯ Z A be an anticanonical transformation with a Fermion generator F . Consider the equation (E.11) as rewritten in the form</figDesc>
					<trash>d dt ln J 1/2 = − ¯ ∆ ¯ F , (E.36) where the ¯ ∆-operator is defined in (E.12). A formal solution to (E.36) has the form ln J 1/2 = −[(exp{ad(tF )} − 1)/ad(F )]∆F. (E.37) It follows immediately from (E.12) d dt ¯ ∆ = exp{ad(tF )}[ad(F ), ∆] exp{ad(−tF )} = = ad(− exp{ad(tF )}∆F ) = d dt ad( ln J 1/2 ), (E.38) which implies 9 ¯ ∆ = ∆ + ad( ln J 1/2 ). (E.39)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>That is just the transformation property of the ∆ operator under anticanonical transformation.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Further, it follows from (E.36) ¯ ∆ d dt ( ln J 1/2 ) = 0. (E.40) By substituting (E.39), we get d dt 1 2 ( ln J 1/2 , ln J 1/2 ) + ∆ ln J 1/2 = 0, (E.41) which implies ∆ exp ln J 1/2 = ∆(J 1/2 ) = 0. (E.42)</trash>

				<p>That is just the antisymplectic counterpart to the Hamiltonian Liouville Theorem [18, 13].</p>
