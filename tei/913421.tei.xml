				<p>We discuss the effective interactions of axion supermultiplet, which might be important for analyzing the cosmological aspect of supersymmetric axion model. Related to axino cosmology, it is stressed that three seemingly similar but basically different quantities , the Wilsonian axino-gluino-gluon coupling, the 1PI axino-gluino-gluon amplitude, and the PQ anomaly coefficient, should be carefully distinguished from each other for correct analysis of the thermal production of axinos in the early Universe. It is then noticed that the 1PI axino-gluino-gluon amplitude at energy scale p in the range M Φ &lt; p &lt; v P Q is suppressed by M 2 Φ /p 2 in addition to the well-known suppression by p/16π 2 v P Q , where M Φ is the mass of the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter supermultiplet in the model, which can be well below the PQ scale v P Q. As a result, axino production at temperature T &gt; M Φ is dominated by the production by matter supermultiplet, not by the production by gauge supermultiplet. Still the axino production rate is greatly reduced if M Φ ≪ v P Q , which would make the subsequent cosmology significantly altered. This would be most notable in the supersymmetric DFSZ model in which M Φ corresponds to the Higgsino mass which is around the weak scale, however a similar reduction is possible in the KSVZ model also. We evaluate the relic axino density for both the DFSZ and KSVZ models while including the axino production in the processes involving the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter supermultiplet.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Supersymmetric extension of the standard model provides perhaps the most appealing solution to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. Furthermore it can easily accommodate the axion solution to the strong CP problem [2, 3, 4] which is another naturalness problem of the standard model. Supersymmetric axion model [5, 6] necessarily contains the superpartners of axion, the axino and saxion, which can have a variety of cosmological implications.</p>

				<p>In particular, axino can be a good candidate for cold dark matter [7] in the Universe, depending upon the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and the presumed cosmological scenario [8, 9].</p>

				<p>One of the key issues in axino cosmology is the thermal production of axino by scattering or decay of particles in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. Most of the previous analysis of thermal axino production [10, 11, 12] is based on the following form of local effective interaction between the axion supermultiplet and the gauge supermutiplet:</p>

				<p><formula>d 2 θ 1 32π 2 A v P Q W aα W a α , (1.1)</formula></p>

				<p>where v P Q is the scale of spontaneous PQ breakdown, and A = (s + ia)/ √ 2 + √ 2θã + θ 2 F A is the axion superfield which contains the axion a, the saxion s, and the axinõ a as its component fields. If axinos were in thermal equilibrium, their relic density can be determined in a straightforward manner, and the result does not depend on the details of axino interactions. For the other case that axinos were not in thermal equilibrium, one usually assumes that the production is mostly due to the effective interaction (1.1). Then a simple dimensional analysis implies that the axino production rate per unit volume scales as Γ ˜ a ∝ T 6 /(16π 2 v P Q ) 2 , which results in a relic axino number to entropy ratio Y ˜ a ∝ T R /(16π 2 v P Q ) 2 , where the reheat temperature T R is assumed to be lower than both v P Q and the axino decoupling temperature. If axino is a stable dark matter (DM), this – 1 – result leads to a severe upper limit on m ˜ a T R [8, 9]. Even when axino is not stable, thermal axino production in the early Universe can affect the later stage of cosmological evolution in various ways, e.g. there can be a late decay of axino into lighter particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) or into the lighter gravitino and axion [13, 14, 15, 16], which might affect the relic DM density, or the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis, or the structure formation.</p>

				<p>In this paper, we discuss the effective interactions of axion supermultiplet in a general context, and examine the implications for cosmological axino production. It is stressed that three seemingly similar but basically different quantities, the Wilsonian axino-gauginogauge boson coupling, the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude, and the PQ anomaly coefficient, should be carefully distinguished from each other for correct analysis of the cosmological axino production. At any given scale, the Wilsonian coupling is local by construction, but it depends severely on the field basis adopted to define the effective theory. On the other hand, the 1PI amplitude is an observable quantity, and therefore is basis-independent, while it generically contains non-local piece and has different value at different energy scale of external particles. The PQ anomaly coefficient is an intrinsic property of the PQ symmetry of the model, which is basis-independent and has a common value at all scales as a consequence of the anomaly matching condition. At any temperature below v P Q , axino production by gauge supermultiplet is determined by the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude at the corresponding energy scale. Our key observation is that the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude at energy scale p in the range M Φ &lt; p &lt; v P Q does not scale like the Wilsonian effective interaction (1.1), but is suppressed further by the factor M 2 Φ /p 2 , where M Φ is the mass of the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter field in the model, which can be well below v P Q in general. This is a simple consequence of that the axion supermultiplet is decoupled from gauge supermultiplets (and from charged matter supermultiplets also) in the limit M Φ → 0, which is not manifest if one considers the effective interaction (1.1) alone, but recovered in the full analysis taking into account all interactions of the axion supermultiplet together. As a result, if M Φ ≪ v P Q , which is possible in most cases, axino production by gauge supermultiplets is greatly reduced. This would be most dramatic in the supersymmetric Dine-Fishler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model [17] as the model does not contain any exotic PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter field other than the matter and Higgs fields in the MSSM, and therefore M Φ is around the weak scale. A similar suppression is possible in the supersymmetric Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) axion model [18] also, in which M Φ corresponds to the mass of an exotic PQ-charged quark multiplet, which in principle can take any value between the PQ scale and the weak scale. An immediate consequence of the above observation is that axino production in the temperature range M Φ &lt; T &lt; v P Q is dominated not by the production by gauge supermultiplets , but by the production by the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter multiplet Φ. If M Φ ≪ v P Q , axino production rate at T &gt; M Φ is greatly reduced compared to the previous result based on the effective interaction (1.1) alone. This can significantly alter the cosmological aspect of the model. For instance, a high reheat temperature which has been considered to produce too much axino dark matter can be allowed if M Φ ≪ v P Q .</p>

				<p>– 2 – Also, our result can relieve the upper bound on the reheat temperature, which has been obtained in [14] by considering the gravitino and axino productions together, and might have implication for the cosmological bounds on axion supermultiplet in the presence of small R-parity breaking, which have been discussed in [16]. Since the interaction rate between the axino and the thermal bath of gauge-charged particles is reduced in the limit M Φ ≪ T , the axino decoupling temperature can take a higher value than the previous estimate based on (1.1). Similar observations apply to the axion and saxion cosmology also, and our result might affect some of the results of the recent analysis of thermal axion production [19]. The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we discuss in a general context the effective interactions of axion supermultiplet which will be crucial for later discussion of cosmological axino production. In section 3, we provide an analysis of thermal axino production for both the KSVZ and DFSZ models, and determine the relic axino density including the contribution from the processes involving the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter multiplet at T &gt; M Φ . Section 4 is the conclusion.</p>

				<head n="2">Effective interactions of axion supermultiplet</head>

				<p>In this section, we discuss the generic feature of the effective interactions of axion supermultiplet [20], which will be relevant for our later discussion of cosmological axino production. For the purpose of illustration, we first consider a simple specific model, a supersymmetric extension of the KSVZ axion model [18], and later generalize the discussion to generic supersymmetric axion models. At the fundamental scale M * , which is presumed to be of the order of the reduced Planck scale M P l ≃ 2.4 × 10 18 GeV, the supersymmetric part of our model is described by the following high scale lagrangian</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L(M * ) = d 4 θ K + d 2 θ 1 4 f a W aα W a α + W (Φ I ) + h.c. , (2.1) where W a α</trash>

				<p>are the gluon superfields, and the Kähler potential K, the holomorphic gauge kinetic function f a , and the superpotential W are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>K = I Φ † I Φ I , f a = 1 ˆ g 2 s (M * ) , W = hZ XY − v 2 P Q 2 + λXQQ c , (2.2) wherê g 2 s (M *</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) is the holomorphic QCD coupling at M * , and Φ I stand for the chiral matter superfields in the model, {Φ I } = {Z, X, Y, Q, Q c }. Among these matter fields, Z, X and Y are gauge singlet, while Q + Q c are colored quark multiplet. Here we distinguish the holomorphic QCD coupling g s from the physical QCD coupling g s for later discussion. Also we ignore non-renormalizable operators suppressed by 1/M * , as well as the similarly suppressed supergravity effects, under the assumption that the PQ scale v P Q is far below M * , so that any effect suppressed by v P Q /M * can be safely ignored.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>– 3 –</head>

				<p>The model is invariant under the global PQ symmetry 1 U (1) P Q : Φ I → e ix I α Φ I , (2.3) where the PQ charge x I are given by x Z , x X , x Y , x Q + x Q c = 0, −1, 1, 1 . (2.4) This PQ symmetry is explicitly broken by the QCD anomaly as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>∂ µ J µ P Q = g 2 16π 2 C P Q F aµν F a µν , (2.5) where J µ</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>P Q is the Noether current for the symmetry transformation (2.3) defined in a gauge invariant regularization scheme, and then the anomaly coefficient is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>C P Q = 2 I x I Tr(T 2 c (Φ I )) = 2(x Q + x Q c )Tr(T 2 c (Q)) = N Q , (2.6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where T c (Φ I ) is the generator of the SU (3) c transformation of Φ I , and N Q is the number of Q + Q c . The QCD instantons then generate an axion potential which has a minimum at the axion vacuum expectation value (VEV) which cancels the QCD vacuum angle, so the strong CP problem is solved [4]. In our convention, the PQ anomaly coefficient C P Q corresponds to the number of the discrete degenerate vacua of the axion potential, which can have a nontrivial cosmological implication [21]. In the following, we will assume N Q = 1 for simplicity.</p>

				<p>In the limit to ignore SUSY breaking effects, the model has a supersymmetric ground state</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>XY = v 2 P Q 2 , Z = 0. (2.7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Including SUSY breaking effects, the VEV of the ratio X/Y can be fixed and a small but nonzero VEV of Z can be induced also. In fact, SUSY breaking part of the model is not essential for our discussion of axino effective interactions, although it is crucial for the determination of the axino and saxion masses [22, 23]. We thus simply assume that soft SUSY breaking terms in the model fix the VEVs as X ∼ Y (2.8) with appropriate (model-dependent, but light) axino and saxion masses, for which the axion scale is given by v P Q . Also, to illustrate our main point, we further assume that</p>

				<p>In addition to the PQ symmetry, we can introduce an approximate U (1)R symmetry under which θ α → e iβ θ α and Z → e 2iβ Z to justify the form of the superpotential. In the present form, the model is invariant under another U (1) symmetry which makes the massive Dirac quark Q + Q c stable. However it is straightforward to break this U (1), while keeping the PQ symmetry unbroken, when the model is combined with the MSSM, making Q + Q c decay fast enough.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>– 4 –</head>

				<p>h = O(1), but λ ≪ 1, so the model involves two widely separated mass scales, the axion scale v P Q and the quark mass M Q which can be far below v P Q :</p>

				<p><formula>M Q ≡ λv P Q √ 2 ≪ v P Q . (2.9)</formula></p>

				<p>All physical consequences of the model can be determined in principle by the high scale lagrangian (2.1). However, for low energy dynamics at scales below v P Q , it is convenient to construct an effective lagrangian at a cutoff scale Λ just below v P Q , which can be obtained by integrating out the massive fields heavier than Λ as well as the high momentum modes of light fields at scales above Λ. In our case, two chiral superfields among X, Y and Z get a mass of O(v P Q ), while the remained combination provides the axion supermultiplet. To integrate out the heavy fields, one can parameterize them as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>X = 1 √ 2 (v P Q + ρ 1 ) e −A/v P Q , Y = 1 √ 2 (v P Q + ρ 1 ) e A/v P Q , Z = ρ 2 , (2.10)</trash>

				</figure>

				<p>is the axion superfield which contains the axion a, the saxion s and the axinõ a as its component fields. After integrating out the heavy ρ i and the high momentum modes of light fields, the resulting Wilsonian effective lagrangian can be chosen to take the following form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L eff (Λ) = d 4 θ K A (A + A † ) + Z Q (A + A † )Q † Q + Z Q c (A + A † )Q c † Q c + d 2 θ 1 4 f eff a (A)W aα W a α + W eff + h.c. , (2.13) where K A = 1 2 (A + A † ) 2 + O (A + A † ) 3 v P Q f eff a = 1 ˆ g 2 s (Λ) − C W 8π 2 A v P Q , W eff = M Q e −(˜ x Q +˜Q c . (2.14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>With the above form of effective lagrangian, the PQ symmetry is realized as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>U (1) P Q : A → A + iαv P Q , Φ → e i˜5 ) – 5 –</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>and the PQ anomaly in the effective theory is given by C P Q = C W + ˜ x Q + ˜ x Q c , (2.16) which should be same as the PQ anomaly (2.6) in the underlying UV theory. For generic form of effective lagrangian consistent with the PQ symmetry (2.15), there can be three types of axino effective interactions at the order of 1/v P Q :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>∆ 1 L(Λ) = − d 2 θ C W 32π 2 A v P Q W aα W a α + h.c., (2.17) ∆ 2 L(Λ) = d 4 θ (A + A † ) v P Q ˜ y Q Q † Q + ˜ y Q c Q c † Q c , (2.18) ∆ 3 L(Λ) = − d 2 θ (˜ x Q + ˜ x c Q )M Q A v P Q QQ c + h.c., (2.19) where ˜ y Φ ≡ v P Q ∂ ln Z Φ ∂A A=0 (Φ = Q, Q c ). (2.20) In our particular case, one easily finds C W = 0, ˜ x Φ = x Φ , ˜ y Φ (Λ) = O 1 16π 2 M 2 Q v 2 P Q ln M * Λ , (2.21)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the small y Φ is induced by the radiative corrections involving the Yukawa coupling λ = √ 2M Q /v P Q at UV scales above Λ. This result shows that the axion supermultiplet is decoupled from the gauge multiplet and charged-matter multiplet in the limit M Q → 0, which is manifest in the UV theory (2.11). Note that the PQ symmetry splits into two global U (1) symmetries in the limit M Q → 0, the axial U (1) symmetry of Q, Q c and the anomaly free U (1) not involving the transformation of Q, Q c , and the axion becomes a massless Goldstone boson of the anomaly-free U (1) part in the limit M Q → 0.</p>

				<p>In fact, one can consider a different description of the same effective theory, for instance a scheme using different form of PQ symmetry under which all light fields at Λ are invariant except the axion superfield. In our case, such description can be achieved by the Adependent field redefinition Φ → e x Φ A/v P Q Φ, making all matter fields except A invariant under the PQ symmetry. Such form of PQ symmetry can be convenient in certain respects since x Φ = 0 (Φ = Q, Q c ), so the PQ anomaly originates entirely from the variation of the local effective interaction (2.17), which results in C P Q = C W . However such field basis is not convenient for a discussion of physics at energy scales above M Q since the decoupling of the axion supermultiplet from the gauge and charged-matter multiplets in the limit M Q → 0 is not manifest, but is achieved by the cancellation between the contributions from C W = N Q and y Q + ˜ y Q c = 1.</p>

				<p>To get more insights, let us consider a more general description associated with the field redefinition</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ → e cx Φ A/v P Q Φ (Φ = Q, Q c ), (2.22) – 6 –</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where c is an arbitrary real constant parameterizing the field basis. After this field redefinition , the PQ symmetry is realized as U (1) P Q : A → A + iαv P Q , Φ → e i(1−c)x Φ α Φ, (2.23) and there appears an axion-dependent local counter term in the effective lagrangian</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>− d 2 θ c(x Q + x Q c ) 32π 2 A v P Q W aα W a α + h.c., (2.24)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which is due to the Konishi anomaly [24] for the field redefinition (2.22). Note that this Konishi anomaly term is required to match the PQ anomaly of (2.23) with the PQ anomaly (2.6). Including the Konishi anomaly, Wilsonian effective couplings of the axion superfield in the redefined field basis are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>C W = c(x Q + x Q c ), ˜ x Φ = (1 − c)x Φ , ˜ y Φ (Λ) = cx Φ + O 1 16π 2 M 2 Q v 2 P Q ln M * Λ . (2.25)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that the PQ anomaly in the redefined field basis is determined by two contributions: C P Q = c(x Q + x Q c ) + (1 − c)(x Q + x Q c ), (2.26) where the first piece is from the variation of the local effective interaction (2.24), while the second piece is from the axial anomaly of the PQ transformation of Q, Q c in (2.23). Obviously each contribution depends on the field basis parameter c, but their sum is independent of c as it should be. Now, if one ignores the part of y Φ suppressed by M 2 Φ /v 2 P Q , Wilsonian effective interactions of the axion supermultiplet are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>∆ 1 L(Λ) = − d 2 θ c(x Q + x Q c ) 32π 2 A v P Q W aα W a α , +h.c., (2.27) ∆ 2 L(Λ) = d 4 θ (A + A † ) v P Q cx Q Q † Q + cx Q c Q c † Q c (2.28) ∆ 3 L(Λ) = − d 2 θ (1 − c)(x Q + x c Q )M Q A v P Q QQ c + h.c.. (2.29)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>With these, one can compute the axino production rate at any temperature T &lt; Λ, and the result should be independent of the field basis parameter c since all physical quantities should be basis-independent. However, most of the previous studies use only the effective interaction of the form (2.27), which can lead to a misleading result as we will see below.</p>

				<p>In fact, considering only the effective interaction (2.27) leads to a highly overestimated result for the axino production at energy scale p ≫ M Q . At such high energy scale, one can take a limit M Q /p → 0 in which the axion supermultiplet is decoupled from the gauge multiplets and charged-matter multiplets. Although such decoupling is not manifest in the effective interactions (2.27) − (2.29) with c = 0, it is manifest in the field basis with c =</p>

				<p>and also in the underlying UV theory (2.11). This means that axino production by gauge supermultiplets at p &gt; M Q should be suppressed by some powers of M Q /p if one takes into account the interactions (2.27) − (2.29) altogether to get a correct c-independent result. On the other hand, the interaction (2.27) by itself does not involve any suppression by M Q /p, and therefore the analysis using (2.27) alone gives a highly overestimated result in the limit p ≫ M Q .</p>

				<p>More explicitly, the effective interaction (2.27) gives the Wilsonian axino-gluino-gluon amplitude</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where p µ and ǫ µ are the gluon momentum and polarization, and u(k) and v(q) are the 4- component Majorana spinor wavefunction of the axino and gluino, respectively. If one uses this amplitude alone to compute the axino production rate in the process gluon + gluon → gluino + axino (see Fig. 1), a simple dimensional analysis tells that the rate (per unit volume) is given by</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where ξ is a dimensionless coefficient which is independent of c. However this can not be the correct answer as it depends on the field-basis parameter c, and there should be additional contribution which removes the c-dependence of the result. Indeed, including the contributions from the axino-gluon-gluino amplitude due to the loops of Q, Q c (see Fig. 2), which involve the c-dependent axino-matter couplings in (2.28) and (2.29), we find that – 8 – the c-dependence in the production rate disappears as required, and the final result takes the form</p>

				<p>which shows that the production rate is indeed suppressed by M 2 Q /T 2 at T &gt; M Q . This result can be obtained by replacing the axino-gluino-gluon vertex in Fig. 1 with the oneparticle-irreducible (1PI) axino-gluino-gluon amplitude</p>

				</figure>

				<p>As we have noticed, C W is a basis-dependent Wilsonian coupling which changes under an A-dependent holomorphic redefinition of charged matter fields, while C 1P I is an observable amplitude invariant under the redefinition of matter fields.</p>

				<p>In the above, we find in the context of a simple supersymmetric KSVZ axion model that the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude at energy scale in the range M Φ &lt; p &lt; v P Q is suppressed by M 2 Φ /p 2 in addition to the well-known suppression by p/16π 2 v P Q , where M Φ is the supersymmetric mass of the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter field, which can be well below v P Q . On the other hand, the 1PI amplitude at energy scales below M Φ has the same scaling behavior as the Wilsonian amplitude (2.30), which can be noticed from (2.35), although the precise coefficient can be different in general. This observation applies also to another type of popular axion model, the DFSZ model [17]. To see this, let us consider a supersymmetric extension of the DFSZ axion model described by the following form of the Kähler potential, gauge kinetic function and superpotential at the UV scale M * :</p>

				<p>and the PQ charges of the quark and lepton superfields can be fixed by the MSSM Yukawa couplings. Here the Higgs µ-term is generated by the spontaneous breakdown of the PQ symmetry [6, 27]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>, yielding µ ∼ κv 2 P Q 2M * . (2.44)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The most notable feature of this DFSZ model is that the Higgs doublets correspond to the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter field, so M Φ = µ which should be around the weak scale. It is straightforward to repeat our discussion for this DFSZ model, and then one finds the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude at p &gt; µ is suppressed by µ 2 /p 2 . This would lead to a dramatic reduction of the cosmological axino production, when compared to the result of the previous analysis using only the effective interaction of the form (2.17). It should be noted that a similar reduction is possible for the KSVZ model also as M Φ = M Q can be in principle comparable to the weak scale.</p>

				<p>Our result can have important implications for the cosmology of supersymmetric axion model. For instance, certain parameter range of the model and/or the cosmological scenario, which has been considered to give a too large relic axino mass density in the previous analysis, can be safe if the model is assumed to have M Φ ≪ v P Q . It also implies that at temperature T &gt; M Φ , axinos are produced dominantly by the processes involving the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter supermultiplet, e.g. Q + gluon → Q + ˜ a for the KSVZ model and higgs + W → higgsino + ˜ a for the DFSZ model, since the amplitude of such process does not involve the loop suppression factor and is suppressed only by a single power of M Φ /v P Q . In the next section, we compute the axino production rate and the resulting relic axino number density while including the production by the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter multiplet for both the KSVZ and DFSZ models. It is in fact straightforward to generalize our discussion to generic supersymmetric axion models. For this, let us consider a general form of Wilsonian effective lagrangian of the axion superfield at a scale Λ just below v P Q , which takes the form</p>

Within the effective theory (2.45), one can make a holomorphic redefinition of matter fields Φ n → e znA/v P Q Φ n , (2.63) after which the PQ symmetry takes the form U (1) P Q : A → A + iαv P Q , Φ n → e i(˜ xn−zn)α Φ n , (2.64) and the Wilsonian couplings of the axion superfield are changed as C a W → C a W + 2 n z n Tr(T 2 a (Φ n )), ˜ y n → ˜ y n + z n , ˜ x n → ˜ x n − z n .

				</figure>

				<p>This shows that one can always choose a field basis with x n = 0, for which only the axion superfield transforms under the PQ symmetry, and therefore C a W = C a P Q . Another interesting choice would be the field basis with y n = 0, for which C a W = C a 1P I . Note – 13 – that C a P Q and C a 1P I are directly linked to observables, and therefore invariant under the reparametrization (2.65) of the Wilsonian couplings associated with the field redefinition (2.63). It should be noticed also that for a given theory, C a P Q have common values at all scales, while C a 1P I can have different values at different momentum scales. On the other hand, C a W are lagrangian parameters which can take different values in different field basis (or in different UV regularization) within the same theory. A key result of our discussion, which has direct implication for cosmological axino production, is that the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude in the momentum range</p>

These UV contributions are either smaller than (2.66) or negligible by itself when M * is comparable to the Planck or GUT scale.

				<p>As we can see from Fig. 9, the axino interactions with gauge-charged particles in DFSZ model are too weak for axinos to be in thermal equilibrium even for high reheat temperature comparable to v P Q .</p>

				<p>In the right panel of Fig. 9, we plot the contours giving the relic axino abundance which would explain the observed DM density Ω DM h 2 ≃ 0.1 [7]. As an approximate guideline, we can refer to hot, warm, and cold axino dark matter for axino mass in the range m ˜ a 1 keV, 1 keV m ˜ a 100 keV, and m ˜ a 100 keV, respectively [11]. Then as shown in the figure, if v P Q few × 10 11 GeV, axino can provide the cold dark matter in our Universe with correct relic abundance. In our case, there is no upper bound on the reheat temperature coming from the relic dark matter density, and therefore we can avoid the previous conclusion that cold axino dark matter scenario is viable only when the reheat temperature is relatively low as T R 10 6 GeV [11]. In this analysis, we have ignored the effects of SUSY breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking on the axino effective interactions, which should be a good approximation for T ≫ 10 3 GeV. We note that the Higgsino (or the Higgs boson) decay into axino can be sizable if one includes SUSY breaking effect around the weak scale. If one includes the electroweak symmetry breaking effect, stop decay also can give a sizable contribution [15]. At any rate, as long as T R &gt; M Φ , the axino production by the decay processes does not significantly alter our result depicted in Fig. 9. For axinos to be a successful cold dark matter, we should also consider the constraints from the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).

				<head n="3.2">KSVZ axion model</head>

				<p>Let us now consider the KSVZ axion model in which the heaviest PQ-charged and gaugecharged field is an exotic quark multiplet Q, Q c with M Q which can take any value between the weak scale and the PQ scale. Fig. 8 suggests that the previous analysis of axino production based on the effective interaction 1 32π 2 v P Q d 2 θAW a W a alone can be applied only for T R ∼ 0.1M Q . More specifically, axinos are produced mostly by the gluon supermultiplet at – 23 – T 0.1M Q , while at higher temperature axino production is mostly due to the transition Q → Q + ˜ a (or Q → Q + ˜ a). Thus our discussion in this paper can significantly alter the previous result if M Q is well below v P Q . To be specific, here we consider M Q = 10 −5 v P Q , and depict the resulting relic axino density in the left panel of Fig. 10</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>for T R &gt; 10 3 GeV and v P Q = 10 11 GeV (solid), 10 12 GeV (dashed), and 10 13 GeV (dotted). For numerical result, we use g 2 = g 2 3 (T = 10 6 − 10 8 GeV) ≃ 1, and find Y ˜ a (T R ≫ M Q ) ≃ 8.8 × 10 −4 10 12 GeV v P Q 2 M Q 10 7 GeV , Y ˜ a (T 0.1M Q ) ≃ 2.2 × 10 −6 10 12 GeV v P Q 2 T R 10 7 GeV . (3.16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Again, the black dashed line in the figure represents the axino number density when axinos were in equilibrium with the thermal bath of gauge-charged particles. Our result shows that axinos could indeed be in thermal equilibrium if v P Q &lt; 10 12 GeV and the reheat temperature is high enough.</p>

				<p>In the right panel of Fig. 10, we plot the contours giving Ω ˜ a h 2 ≃ 0.1, which shows that the CDM constraint gives a severe upper bound on the reheat temperature depending upon the axino mass. Note that our analysis includes the axino productions by the exotic quark multiplet Q, Q c , which in fact provide dominant production channels for T 0.1M Q . As a result, for certain range of the axino mass, the upper bound on T R can be more stringent than the bound one would obtain based on the effective interaction 1 32π 2 v P Q d 2 θAW a W a alone. Still, one can relieve the bound by assuming that M Q is small enough, e.g. close to the weak scale, for which the situation becomes similar to the case of DFSZ model. As in DFSZ model, we should consider the BBN constraint on the decays of long-lived NLSP. For the neutralino decays χ → γ/Z + ˜ a, the rate is given by (3.14) as in DFSZ model. However, there is no tree level coupling for the stau decay τ → τ + ˜ a in KSVZ model, and the decay rate is suppressed by the two-loop factor as [15] Γ(˜ τ → τ +</p>

				<p>where α em is the fine structure constant and e Q = 1/3 is the U (1) em charge of Q. Hence, neutralino lifetime is the same as in the DFSZ case, while stau lifetime is O(10 −2 ) − O(10 4 ) s for v P Q = 10 9 − 10 12 GeV. Therefore, the neutralino NLSP is safe as before, while the stau NLSP is safe only for a relatively heavy m ˜ τ .</p>

				<head n="4">Conclusion</head>

				<p>In this paper, we have discussed certain features of the effective interactions of axion supermultiplet , which might be important for the cosmology of supersymmetric axion model, and examined the implication to the thermal production of axinos in the early Universe.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>– 24 –</head>

				<p>If the model has a UV completion at a fundamental scale M * ≫ v P Q , in which the PQ symmetry is linearly realized in the standard manner and all non-renormalizable interactions are suppressed by the powers of 1/M * , the axion supermultiplet is decoupled from the gauge-charged fields in the limit M Φ /v P Q → 0 and v P Q /M * → 0, where M Φ is the mass of the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter multiplet in the model. As a result, in models with small values of M Φ /v P Q and v P Q /M * , the axino production rate at temperature T ≫ M Φ is suppressed by the powers of small M Φ /T . Such decoupling feature is not manifest in generic form of the effective lagrangian of axion supermultiplet, however it should be imposed as a matching condition at the scale just below v P Q .</p>

				<p>Our observation is particularly important for the cosmology of supersymmetric DFSZ axion model in which M Φ corresponds to the MSSM Higgs µ-parameter which is far below the PQ scale v P Q . Cosmology of KSVZ axion model can be significantly altered also, if the PQ-charged exotic quark has a mass well below v P Q . We have performed an explicit analysis of the thermal production of axinos for both the DFSZ and KSVZ axion models, and presented the resulting relic axino density as well as the bound on the reheat temperature T R coming from the observed dark matter density in our Universe. Our analysis does not take into account the effects of SUSY breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking. For T R close to the weak scale, a more careful analysis is required, including the NLSP decays into axino as well as the mixing due to SUSY breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking, and it will be the subject of future work [31].</p>

(4.13) We then have C 1P I (k 2 = q 2 = 0, p 2 = 0) = C 1P I + O p 2 M 2 heavy + O M 2 light p 2 ln 2 p 2 M 2 light (4.14) with C 1P I (M 2 2 &lt; p 2 &lt; Λ 2 ) = C W − (˜ y 1 + ˜ y c 1 + ˜ y 2 + ˜ y c 2 ), C 1P I (M 2 1 &lt; p 2 &lt; M 2 2 ) = C W + (˜ x 2 + ˜ x c 2 − ˜ y 1 − ˜ y c 1 ), C 1P I ( p 2 &lt; M 2 1 ) = C W + (˜ x 1 + ˜ x c 1 + ˜ x 2 + ˜ x c 2 ). (4.15)</trash>

					<figDesc>If Φ 2 + Φ c 2 corresponds to the heaviest PQ-charged and gauge-charged matter superfield in the underlying model, we would have the boundary condition</figDesc>
					<trash>C 1P I (M 2 2 &lt; p 2 &lt; Λ 2 ) = 0, (4.16)</trash>

					<trash>C 1P I (p) = M 2 i &gt;|p 2 | (˜ x i + ˜ x c i + ˜ y i + ˜ y c i ). (4.17)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Finally, we consider the expression of C 1P I in another kinematic situation when one of the 4-momenta p, q, k is vanishing:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>F (k = 0, p 2 = q 2 = 0) = 2M 2 /|p 2 | 1 + 4M 2 /|p 2 | ln 1 + 1 + 4M 2 /|p 2 | −1 + 1 + 4M 2 /|p 2 | (4.18) – 27 – which has the limiting behavior F ≃ − 2M 2 |p 2 | ln M 2 |p 2 | for |p 2 | ≫ M 2 F ≃ 1 − 1 6 |p 2 | M 2 for |p 2 | ≪ M 2 , (4.19) and therefore C 1P I (k = 0, p 2 = q 2 = 0) = C 1P I + O p 2 M 2 heavy + O M 2 light p 2 ln p 2 M 2 light , (4.20) where C a 1P I are given as (4.15).</trash>

					<figDesc>Appendix B: RG running and threshold corrections</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In this appendix, we discuss the RG running of the Wilsonian and 1PI amplitudes of the axion superfield, using the method of analytic continuation into N = 1 superspace. For this, let us consider a generic Wilsonian effective lagrangian</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L W (Λ) = d 4 θ Z n (Λ; A + A † )Φ † n Φ n (4.21) + d 2 θ 1 4 f eff a (Λ; A)W aα W a α + 1 2 e −(˜ xm+˜n )A/v P Q M mn Φ m Φ n + 1 6 e −(˜ xm+˜n+˜p )A/v P Q λ mnp Φ m Φ n Φ p + h.c. , (4.22) for which C W and y n can be defined as C W (Λ) = −8π 2 v P Q ∂f eff a ∂A A=0 , ˜ y n (Λ) = v P Q d ln Z n ∂A A=0 . (4.23) We then have dñ d ln Λ = 0, dC W d ln Λ = −8π 2 v P Q ∂ ∂A df eff a d ln Λ A=0 = 0, (4.24) while y n can have a nontrivial RG running as dñ d ln Λ = v P Q ∂ ∂A d ln Z n d ln Λ A=0 , (4.25)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where we have used that the RG running of the holomorphic gauge kinetic function f eff a is exhausted at one-loop, and therefore df eff a /d ln Λ = b a /16π 2 is an A-independent constant. In the appendix A, we have seen that the 1PI axino-gaugino-gauge boson amplitude C a 1P I in the kinematic regime with k = 0 and M</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where C 1P I is a constant in 1-loop approximation. Including higher loops, C 1P I can have a logarithmic p-dependence, which can be determined by the 1PI RG equation. To examine this, let us consider the 1PI effective lagrangian at a momentum scale p &lt; Λ, including</p>

					<trash>C 1P I = −8π 2 v P Q ∂F a ∂A A=0 . (4.29)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>One can introduce also the canonical 1PI Yukawa couplings Λ mnp ≡ e −(˜ xm+˜n+˜p )A/v P Q λ mnp Z m Z n Z p</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(4.30) which obeys v P Q ∂|Λ mnp | 2 ∂A A=0 = −(˜ x m + ˜ x n + ˜ x p + ˜ y m (p) + ˜ y n (p) + ˜ y p (p))|Λ mnp | 2 , (4.31) where ˜ y n (p) = v P Q ∂ ln Z n (p) ∂A A=0 . (4.32) The 1PI gauge kinetic function obeys the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakhatov (NSVZ) RG equation dF a d ln p 2 ≡ β a = 1 16π 2 1 1 − Tr(T 2 a (G))/8π 2 F a b a + n Tr(T 2 a (Φ n ))γ n , (4.33) where γ n (p) ≡ d ln Z n d ln p . (4.34)</trash>

					<figDesc>Both β a and γ n can be expressed as a function of the 1PI gauge coupling g 2 a = 1/F a and the 1PI Yukawa coupling |Λ mnp | 2 . We then find the 1PI RG equations for C a 1P I and y n are given by</figDesc>
					<trash>dC 1P I d ln p = −8π 2 v P Q ∂β a ∂A A=0 = −8π 2 v P Q ∂β a ∂F a ∂F a ∂A + ∂β a ∂|Λ mnp | 2 ∂|Λ mnp | 2 ∂A A=0 = C a 1P I ∂β a ∂F a + 8π 2 (˜ x m + ˜ x n + ˜ x p + ˜ y m + ˜ y n + ˜ y p )|Λ mnp | 2 ∂β a 1P I ∂|Λ mnp | 2 , (4.35) dñ d ln p = v P Q ∂γ n ∂A A=0 = v P Q ∂γ n ∂F a ∂F a ∂A + ∂γ n ∂|Λ mnp | 2 ∂|Λ mnp | 2 ∂A A=0 = C a 1P I g 4 a 8π 2 ∂γ n ∂g 2 a − (˜ x m + ˜ x n + ˜ x p + ˜ y m + ˜ y n + ˜ y p )|Λ mnp | 2 ∂γ n ∂|Λ mnp | 2 . (4.36) – 29 –</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In section 2, we noticed that the Yukawa couplings of the model are constrained by the PQ selection rule (˜ x m + ˜ x n + ˜ x p + ˜ y m + ˜ y n + ˜ y p )λ mnp = O</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M 2 Φ v 2 P Q + O v P Q M * . (4.37) With the boundary value C a 1P I at p ≃ v P Q , which is estimated as (2.73), the RG equations (4.35) and (4.36) assure that C a 1P I (M Φ &lt; p &lt; v P Q ) = O M 2 Φ v 2 P Q + O v 2 P Q M 2 * , (4.38)</trash>

				<p>and therefore the result (2.66) remains valid even after higher loop effects are included.</p>

				<p>Appendix C: Thermal axino production by matter multiplet</p>

				<p>In this appendix, we present a calculation of the relic axino density when the axinos are produced dominantly by the matter multiplet Φ at T ≫ M Φ . The Boltzmann equation of axino production is given by dñ a dt + 3Hñ a = σ (I+J→K+ã) v(n I n J − n K n ˜ a ), (4.39) where n I is the number density of the I-th particle species. At high temperature of our interest, all particles except axinos are in thermal equilibrium, so we can write n I = n eq I , where n eq I is the equilibrium number density of particle I. From the relation of the detailed balance, we have σ (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>I+J→K+ã) vn eq I n eq J = σ (I+J→K+ã) vn eq K n eq a . (4.40) Defining Y ˜ a = n ˜ a /s, the Boltzmann equation becomes dY a dt = sσ (I+J→K+ã) vY eq K (Y eq a − Y ˜ a ). (4.41) For ∆ ˜ a ≡ Y eq a − Y ˜ a , we have d∆ a ∆ ˜ a = −sσ (I+J→K+ã) vY eq K dt, (4.42) which yields ∆ ˜ a (T 0 ) = ∆ ˜ a (T R ) exp − T R T 0 sσ (I+J→K+ã) vY eq K H(T )T dT . (4.43)</trash>

					<figDesc>As long as axinos are relativistic in the temperature of interest, Y eq a is independent of temperature. Then we can use</figDesc>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> This estimate is based on the simple identification p 2 ∼ T 2 , which might not work for instance for the t-channel processes with the final state axino momentum parallel to the initial state gluino (or gluon) momentum [28]. However, including the thermal mass of intermediate state gluon (or gluino), which is of O(gT ), this simple approach does work for the purpose of the order of magnitude estimation. – 20 –</note>
