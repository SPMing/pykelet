				<p>Why should we study rare charm decays?</p>

				<p>At HERA recent measurements of the charm production cross section in ep collisions at an energy √ s ep ≈ 300 GeV yielded a value of about 1µb [1]. For an integrated luminosity of 250 pb −1 , one expects therefore about 25 · 10 7 produced cc pairs, mainly through the boson-gluon fusion process. This corresponds to a total of about 30 · 10 7 neutral D o , 10 · 10 7 charged D ± , some 5 · 10 7 D S , and about 5 · 10 7 charmed baryons. A sizable fraction of this large number of D&apos;s is accessible via decays within a HERA detector, and thus should be used to improve substantially our knowledge on charmed particles.</p>

				<p>There are several physics issues of great interest. This report will cover however only aspects related to the decay of charmed mesons in rare decay channels, and in this sense provides an update of the discussion presented in an earlier workshop on HERA physics [2]. In the following we shall discuss these aspects, and point out the theoretical expectations. Based on experiences made at HERA with charm studies, we shall present an estimate on the sensitivity for the detailed case study of the search for the rare decay D 0 → µ + µ − . Other challenging aspects such as the production mechanism and detailed comparisons with QCD calculations, or the use of charmed particles in the extraction of proton and photon parton densities, will not be covered here.</p>

				<p>Possibly the most competitive future source of D-mesons is the proposed tau-charm factory. The continuing efforts at Fermilab (photoproduction and hadroproduction experiments), at CERN (LEP) and at Cornell(CESR), which are presently providing the highest sensitivities, are compared with the situation at HERA. In addition, all these different approaches provide useful and complementary information on various properties in the charm system.</p>

				<head n="2.1">Leading decays</head>

				<p>The charm quark is the only heavy quark besides the b quark and can be used to test the heavy quark symmetry [3] by measuring form factors or decay constants. Hence, the D-meson containing a charmed quark is heavy as well and disintegrates through a large number of decay channels. The leading decays c → s + q ¯ q or c → s + ¯ lν occur with branching ratios of order a few % and allow studies of QCD mechanisms in a transition range between high and very low energies.</p>

				<p>Although experimentally very challenging, the search for the purely leptonic decays D ± → µ ± ν and an improved measurement of D ± S → µ ± ν should be eagerly pursued further, since these decays offer direct access to the meson decay constants f D and f D S , quantities that can possibly be calculated accurately by lattice gauge theory methods [4],[5]</p>

				<p>Singly Cabibbo suppressed decays (SCSD)</p>

				<p>Decays suppressed by a factor sin θ C , the socalled singly Cabibbo suppressed decays (SCSD), are of the form c → du ¯ d or c → s¯ su. Examples of SCSD, such as D → ππ or K ¯ K have been observed at a level of 10 −3 branching ratio (1.5 and 4.3 ·10 −3 , respectively) [6]. They provide information about the CKM-matrix, and also are background processes to be worried about in the search for rare decays.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The existing upper bounds are at the level of a few 10 −4 , with branching ratios expected at the level of 10 −5 . These DCSD are particularly interesting from the QCDpoint of view, and quite a few predictions have been made[7]. DCSD also act as one of the main background processes to the D 0 ↔ ¯ D 0 mixing and therefore must be well understood, before the problem of mixing itself can be successfully attacked.</p>

				<p>As in the neutral Kaon and B-meson system, mixing between the D 0 and the ¯ D 0 is expected to occur (with ∆C = 2). The main contribution is expected due to long distance effects, estimated to be as large as about r D ∼ 5 · 10 −3 [8], while the standard box diagram yields r D ∼ 10 −5 [9]. Here r D is the mixing parameter r D ≃ (1/2) · (∆M/Γ) 2 , with contributions by the DCSD neglected. Recall that the DCSD poses a serious background source in case only the time-integrated spectra are studied. The two sources can however be better separated, if the decay time dependence of the events is recorded separately (see e.g. [10]). More details on the prospect of measuring mixing at HERA are given in [11]</p>

				<p>Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC)</p>

				<p>An important feature of the standard model is that flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC with ∆C = 1) only occur at the one loop level in the SM i.e. through short distance contributions , such as e.g. in penguin and box diagrams as shown in figs.1 and 2. These are transitions of the form s → d + N or c → u + N, where N is a non-hadronic neutral state such as γ or l ¯ l, and give rise to the decays D → ργ, D 0 → µ + µ − , D + → π + µ + µ − etc. Although the relevant couplings are the same as those of leading decays, their rates are very small as they are suppressed by the GIM mechanism [12] and the unfavourable quark masses within the loops. The SM-prediction for the branching ratios are of order 10 −9 for D 0 → Xl + l − and of O(10 −15 ) for D 0 → l + l − , due to additional helicity suppression. A summary of the expected branching ratios obtained from calculations of the loop integrals ([13], [7], [2], [14]) using also the QCDshort distance corrections available [15] is given in table 1.</p>

				<p>However, FCNC are sensitive to new, heavy particles in the loops, and above all, to new physics in general.</p>

				<p>In addition to these short distance loop diagrams, there are contributions from long distance effects, which might be even larger by several orders of magnitude[14]. To mention are photon pole amplitudes (γ-pole) and vector meson dominance (VMD) induced processes. The γ-pole model (see fig.3) in essence is a W-exchange decay with a virtual photon radiating from one of the quark lines. The behaviour of the amplitude depends on the spin state of the final state particle (vector V or pseudoscalar P). The dilepton mass distribution for D → V l + l − modes peaks at zero (small Q 2 ) since the photon prefers to be nearly real. On the other hand, the pole amplitude for D → P l + l − decays vanishes for small dilepton masses because D → P γ is forbidden by angular momentum conservation. The VMD model (see fig.3b) proceeds through the decay D → XV 0 → Xl + l − . The intermediate vector meson V 0 (ρ, ω, φ) mixes with a virtual photon which then couples to the lepton pair. The dilepton mass spectrum therefore will exhibit poles at the corresponding vector meson masses due to real V 0 mesons decaying.</p>

				<p>Observation of FCNC processes at rates that exceed the long distance contributions hence opens a window into physics beyond the standard model. Possible scenarios include leptoquarks or heavy neutral leptons with sizable couplings to e and µ.</p>

				<p>A measurement of such long distance contributions in the charm sector is inherently of interest, as it can be used to estimate similar effects in the bottom sector [16], e.g. for the decay b → sγ, which was seen at the level of 2.3 · 10 −4 . A separation of short and long range contributions would allow e.g. a determination of | V td /V ts | from the ratio BR(B → ργ)/BR(B → K * γ) and bears as such a very high potential.</p>

				<head n="2.5">Forbidden decays</head>

				<p>Decays which are not allowed to all orders in the standard model, the forbidden decays, are exciting signals of new physics. Without claim of completeness, we shall list here some of the more important ones: • Lepton number (L) or lepton family (LF) number violation (LFNV) in decays such as D 0 → µe, D 0 → τ e. It should be strongly emphasized that decays of D-mesons test couplings complementary to those effective in K-or B-meson decays. Furthermore, the</p>

				<p>charmed quark is the only possible charge 2/3 quark which allows detailed investigations of unusual couplings. These are often predicted to occur in models with i) technicolour [17]; ii) compositeness [18]; iii) leptoquarks [19] [20]; (see e.g. fig.4a and b); this can include among others non-SU(5) symmetric flavour-dependent couplings (u to l ± , and d to ν), which would forbid decays of the sort K L → µµ, µe, while still allowing for charm decays; iv) massive neutrinos (at the loop level) in an extended standard model; v) superstring inspired phenomenological models e.g. MSSM models with a Higgs doublet; vi) scalar exchange particles that would manifest themselves e.g. in decays of the form D 0 → ν ¯ ν. • Further models feature horizontal interactions, mediated by particles connecting u and c or d and s quarks (see e.g. fig.4a). They appear with similar signatures as the doubly Cabibbo suppressed decays. • Baryon number violating decays, such as D 0 → pe − or D + → ne − . They are presumably very much suppressed, although they are not directly related to proton decay.</p>

				<p>The clean leptonic decays make it possible to search for leptoquarks. If they do not couple also to quark-(anti)quark pairs, they cannot cause proton decay but yield decays such as K → ¯ l 1 l 2 or D → ¯ l 1 l 2 . In the case of scalar leptoquarks there is no helicity suppression and consequently the experimental sensitivity to such decays is enhanced. Let us emphasize here again, that decays of D-mesons are complementary to those of Kaons, since they probe different leptoquark types. To estimate the sensitivity we write the effective four-fermion coupling as</p>

					<figDesc>Here g ef f is an effective coupling and includes possible mixing effects. Similarly, the decays D + → e + ν, D + → π + e + e − can be used to set bounds on M LQ .

				</figure>

				<p>Any theory attempting to explain the hadron-lepton symmetry or the &quot; generation &quot; aspects of the standard model will give rise to new phenomena connected to the issues mentioned here. Background problems make it quite difficult to search for signs of them at high energies; therefore precision experiments at low energies (like the highly successful µ-, π-or K-decay experiments) are very suitable to probe for any non-standard phenomena.</p>

				<p>In this section we present an estimate on the sensitivity to detect the decay mode D 0 → µ + µ − .</p>

				<p>As was pointed out earlier, this is among the cleanest manifestation of FCNC or LFNV processes [13]. We base the numbers on our experience gained in the analysis of the 1994 data, published in [1]. There the D-meson decay is measured in the decay mode D</p>

				<head n="4">Background considerations 4.1 Background sources and rejection methods</head>

				<p>The most prominent sources of background originate from i) genuine leptons from semileptonic B-and D-decays, and decay muons from K, π decaying in the detector; ii) misidentified hadrons, i.e. π, K, from other decays, notably leading decays and SCSD; and iii) combinatorial background from light quark processes.</p>

				<p>• Vertex separation requirements for secondary vertices:</p>

				<p>Background from light quark production, and of muons from K-and π-decays within the detector are further rejected by exploiting the information of secondary vertices (e.g. decay length separation, pointing back to primary vertex etc.). • Lepton identification (example H1) : Electron identification is possible by using dE/dx measurements in the drift chambers, the shower shape analysis in the calorimeter (and possibly the transition radiators information ). Muons are identified with the instrumented iron equipped with limited streamer tubes, with the forward muon system, and in combination with the calorimeter information . The momentum has to be above ∼ 1.5 to 2 GeV/c to allow the µ to reach the instrumented iron. Thus, the decay D 0 → µ + µ − suffers from background contributions by the SCSD mode D 0 → π + π − , albeit with a known BR = 1.6 · 10 −3 ; here µ-identification helps extremely well. An example of background suppression using the particle ID has been shown in ref.[2], where a suppression factor of order O(100) has been achieved.</p>

				<p>• Particle ordering methods exploit the fact that the decay products of the charmed mesons tend to be the leading particles in the event (see e.g. [23]). In the case of observed jets, the charmed mesons are expected to carry a large fraction of the jet energy.</p>

				<p>• Event variables such as e.g. the total transverse energy E transverse tend to reflect the difference in event topology between heavy and light quark production processes, and hence lend themselves for suppression of light quark background.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="4.2">Additional experimental considerations</head>

				<p>• Further possibilities to enhance overall statistics are the usage of inclusive decays (no tagging), where the gain in statistics is expected to be about N (allD 0 ) N (D 0 f romD * ) = 0.61/0.21 ≈ 3, however on the the cost of higher background contributions. • In the decays D 0 → ee or D 0 → µe one expects factors of 2 to 5 times better background rejection efficiency. • Trigger : A point to mention separately is the trigger. To be able to measure a BR at the level of 10 −5 , the event filtering process has to start at earliest possible stage. This should happen preferably at the first level of the hardware trigger, because it will not be feasible to store some 10 +7 events on permanent storage to dig out the few rare decay candidates. This point, however, has up to now not yet been thoroughly studied, let alone been implemented at the hardware trigger level.</p>

				<p>• DESY : ARGUS e + e − : stopped, final papers emerging now. HERA-B : With a very high cross section of σ(pN → c¯ c) ≈ 30µb at √ s = 39 GeV and an extremely high luminosity, a total of up to 10 12 c¯ c - events may be produced .</p>

				<p>no detailed studies exist so far , a sensitivity of order 10 −5 to 10 −7 might be expected , depending on the background rates .</p>

				<p>• CESR : CLEO is continuing steadily to collect data , and above all is the present leader in sensitivity for many processes ( see table 2 ) .</p>

				<p>• BEPC : BES has collected data at √ s = 4 . 03 GeV ( and 4 . 14 GeV ) , and is continuing to do so ; BES will become competitive as soon as enough statistics is available , because the background conditions are very favourable .</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>• τ - charm factory : The prospects for a facility being built in China ( Beijing ) are uncertain . If realized , this is going to be the most sensitive place to search for rare charm decays . Both , kinematical constraints ( e . g . running at the ψ ′′ ( 3700 ) ) and the missing background from non - charm induced processes will enhance its capabilities .</figDesc>

				<head n="6">Summary</head>

				<p>D - meson decays offer a rich spectrum of interesting physics ; their rare decays may provide information on new physics , which is complementary to the knowledge stemming from K - meson and B - decays . With the prospect of order a few times 10 8 produced charmed mesons per year , HERA has the potential to contribute substantially to this field . Further competitive results can be anticipated from the fixed target experiments at Fermilab or from a possible τ - charm factory .</p>

					<trash>For the rare decay D 0 → µ + µ</trash>

					<figDesc>− investigated here we expect at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over current results ( see table given above ) for a total integrated luminosity of</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Ldt = 250 pb −1 , the limitation here being statistical . An extrapolation to even higher luminosity is rather difficult without a very detailed numerical simulation , because at some ( yet unknown ) level the background processes will become the main limiting factor for the sensitivity , rendering sheer statistics useless . For this , a good tracking resolution , excellent particle identification ( e , µ , π , K , p ) and a high resolution for secondary vertices is required to keep the systematics under control , and either to unambigously identify a signal of new physics , or to reach the ultimate limit in sensitivity .</p>
