				<p>The linearized field equations of general relativity in harmonic coordinates are given by an inhomogeneous wave equation. In the region exterior to the matter field, the retarded solution of this wave equation can be expanded in terms of 10 Cartesian symmetric and tracefree (STF) multipoles in post-Minkowskian approximation. For such a multipole decomposition only three and rather weak assumptions are required: 1. No-incoming radiation condition. 2. The matter source is spatially compact. 3. A spherical expansion for the metric outside the matter source is possible. During the last decades, the STF multipole expansion has been established as a powerful tool in several fields of gravitational physics: celestial mechanics, theory of gravitational waves and in the theory of light propagation and astrometry. But despite its formidable importance, an explicit proof of the fundamental theorem of STF multipole expansion has not been presented thus far, while only some parts of it are distributed into several publications. In a technical but more didactical form, an explicit and detailed mathematical proof of each individual step of this important theorem of STF multipole expansion is represented. 2 Contents</p>

				<head>I. INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>The field equations of gravity, Einstein (1915,1916) [1, 2], constitute a set of 10 coupled nonlinear partial differential equations which relate the metric tensor g αβ of curved spacetime to the stress-energy tensor of matter T αβ . Due to the inherited mathematical difficulties of solving these field equations in closed form, exact and physically well interpretable solutions of general theory of relativity are on rare occasions [3]. The most well-known examples for the case of massive isolated sources are the metric of a spherically symmetric massive body derived by Schwarzschild (1916) [4], the solution for a spherically symmetric and electrically charged body found by Reissner (1916) [5] and Nordström (1918) [6], and the metric for rotating bodies obtained by Kerr (1963) [7]. However, for more realistic scenarios, like an accelerated body, an asymmetric body, or a N-body system, exact solutions for the metric field are far out of reach or even do not exist. Therefore, approximative approaches of general relativity are essential for further progress in the theory of gravity. An important approximative approach is the theory of linearized gravity, where in harmonic gauge the coupled field equations of Einstein&apos;s theory are simplified to a set of decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations for each of the 10 components of the metric tensor, Einstein (1916) [8]: x h αβ (t, x) = − 16 π G c 4 T αβ (t, x) , (1) which is valid up to order O (G 2 ), and G is the gravitational constant. In Eq. (1), x is the d&apos;Alembert operator, h αβ = η αβ − √ −g g αβ is the metric perturbation (g = determinant of g αβ , η αβ = diag (−1, +1, +1, +1) is the metric of flat space-time), and c is the speed of light; the curved spacetime is assumed to be covered by harmonic coordinates (t, x).</p>

				<p>The mathematical structure of linearized field equations (1) resembles the field equations of classical electrodynamics in Lorentz gauge, x A µ = − 4 π c j µ , with A µ being the four-potential and j µ the four-current, but with the addition that in classical electrodynamics the space-time is Minkowskian, while the space-time in linearized gravity is in fact curved. Especially, the Green functions of both field equations are formally the same, and the harmonic coordinates (t, x) are treated as though they were Cartesian coordinates in flat Minkowski space [19]. Hence, like in classical electrodynamics, a solution of (1) is given by, Einstein (1916) [8]</p>

				<p>where the integral runs over some finite spatial volume V of the extended matter field, t ret = t − |x ′ − x| c is the retarded time from a point inside the matter source with spatial coordinate x ′ to a field point with spatial coordinate x. The so-called advanced solution, where t ret in (2) is replaced by t adv = t + |x ′ − x| c , is usually be regarded unphysical because it violates the causality condition and will not be considered here. The multipole decomposition of (2) in terms of spherical harmonics is a highly effective approach to further analyze this solution. That tool of multipole expansion has originally been applied a long time ago in classical electrodynamics [10] and later been transformed into the case of linearized gravity. In this respect, a bench mark was the investigation of Campbell, Macek &amp; Morgan (1977) [11] who have worked out a multipole decomposition of the scalar (gravitational potential), vectorial (electrodynamical four-potential) and tensorial (linearized gravity) field outside the matter source in terms of spherical harmonics. However, the use of so-called Cartesian symmetric and tracefree (STF) multipole moments [12–18] instead of spherical harmonics simplifies considerably the calculations in gravitational physics [19–22]: the mathematical relations and expressions in gravitational theory become simpler, the numerical algorithms can be performed more efficiently, and the whole approach of gravitational theory becomes more elegant. By now, the STF multipole expansion , in post-Newtonian approximation ( &quot; weak-field slow-motion approximation &quot; , i.e. g 00 , g ij exact to order O (c −2 ), g 0i exact to order O (c −3 )) and post-Minkowskian approximation ( &quot; weak-field approximation &quot; , i.e. g αβ exact to order O (G)), has been established as an important tool in linearized gravity and has found a wide range of applications: in celestial mechanics [22–24], in the theory of gravitational waves [25–27], and in the theory of light propagation in curved space-time [28–31] which is a fundamental aspect of relativistic astrometry. Meanwhile, the STF multipole expansion in linearized gravity has a remarkable history and encompasses some decades of period of time. Let us mention some important contributions which are considered as cornerstones in the theory of multipole expansion; further historical facts can be found, for instance, in Box 1 in [19], introductory sections in [20] and [32], and in Section 4.4 in [33]. First, the approach developed in [11] has been established in terms of STF tensors in a pioneering work by Thorne (1980) [19] in post-Newtonian approximation, where some first steps of earlier investigations [12, 13, 34, 35] have considerably been generalized. Especially, Thorne (1980) [19] has shown that the metric outside the matter source can be expanded in terms of 10 STF tensors as follows (Eqs. (8.4) in [19]):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>h αβ (t, x) = 4 G c 4 ∞ l=0 (−1) l l! ∂ L ˆ F αβ L (u) r , (3) where ∂ L = ∂ l ∂x a 1 ... ∂x a l</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>are l spatial derivatives, r = |x| is the spatial distance between the origin of coordinate system and the field point with spatial coordinate x,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ F αβ L are 10 STF multipoles, and u = ct − r. Moreover, Thorne (1980) [19] has shown, using energymomentum conservation (Eqs. (8.6) and (8.7) in [19]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) and a sophisticated gauge transformation (Eqs. (8.9) in [19]) which preserves the harmonic gauge, that outside the matter the metric can finally be expressed in terms of 2 independent multipoles in post-Newtonian approximation: mass multipoles M L and spin multipoles S L (Eqs. (8.13) in [19]). However, the multipoles (Eqs. (5.32) in [19]) were still formally divergent at spatial infinity. Consequently, Blanchet &amp; Damour (1986) [20] have further developed the approach in [19] and have demonstrated that Thorne&apos;s post-Newtonian multipoles are physically meaningful if one makes a rigorous use of the compact-support source of energy-momentum tensor. This important result has been achieved with the aid of the theory of distributions by means of which Blanchet &amp; Damour (1986) [20] were able to extract the physically relevant and nondivergent part of Thorne&apos;s multipoles in post-Newtonian approximation. Finally, Blanchet &amp; Damour (1989) [21] have established a powerful theorem in post- Minkowskian approximation which states that outside of an isolated source the metric can be expanded in terms of 10 Cartesian STF multipoles (3) (Eqs. (B.2) and (B.3) in [21]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>), defined by ˆ F αβ L (u) = V d 3 x ′ ˆ x ′ L +1 −1 dz δ l (z) T αβ u + z r ′ c , x ′ , (4) wherê x ′ L = STF a 1 ,... ,a l x ′ a 1 , ... , x ′ a l , and r ′ = |x ′</trash>

				</figure>

				<p>dz δ l (z) = 1. As we will see, the expansion (3) is valid in regions r &gt; r 0 , where r 0 is the radius of the smallest possible sphere which contains completely the source of matter. The expansion (3) -(4) represents the fundamental theorem of STF multipole expansion in linearized gravity, e.g. Eqs. (B.2) -(B.3) in [21]</p>

					<trash>, Eqs. (5.3) -(5.4) in [36]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>, Eqs. (56) -(57) in [26], or Eq. (25) in [27], and stands for a solution of linearized field equations (1) in post-Minkowskian approximation, hence it is even valid in case of ultra-relativistic motion of matter inside the source. After all, using energy-momentum conservation (Eqs. (5.14) and (5.18) in [36]) and applying a sophisticated gauge choice (Eq. (5.31) in [36]) Damour &amp; Iyer (1991) [36] have demonstrated , footing on the pioneering works of Thorne (1980) [19] and Blanchet &amp; Damour (1986,1989) [20, 21], that also in post-Minkowskian approximation the family of these 10 multipoles can be reduced to finally only 2 independent multipoles: mass multipoles M L (Eq. (5.33) in [36]) and spin multipoles S L (Eq. (5.35) in [36]):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>h αβ = h αβ M L , ˆ S L . (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The demonstration, that the metric in (3) which depends on 10 multipoles F αβ L can be reduced to the form in (6) where the metric depends only on 2 multipoles ( ˆ M L , ˆ S L ), is a rather ambitious assignment of a task and makes extensive use of irreducible Cartesian tensor techniques originally introduced in [16–18]. Damour &amp; Iyer (1991) [36] have also demonstrated that to order O (c −4 ) their post-Minkowskian multipoles coincide with the post-Newtonian multipoles of Blanchet &amp; Damour (1989) [21] (Eqs. (5.38) and (5.41) in [36]). So the investigation in [36] has been the final touch in the approach of STF multipole expansion to order O (G). This elaborated work of Damour &amp; Iyer (1991) [36] will, however, not be on the scope of the present investigation. Instead, we will be focussed on theorem (3) -(4), which is the heart and the core part of STF multipole expansion. An explicit proof of this important theorem is not so straightforward as one might believe and has not been presented in detail thus far; only some parts of it are published but scattered in several publications [11, 19–21]. Here, in view of its formidable relevance in the theory of linearized gravity, we will outline a more detailed mathematical proof of each individual step of multipole expansion (3) in post-Minkowskian approximation. The paper is organized as follows: In section II a compendium of the exact field equations of gravity is provided. The linearized approximation of general relativity is given in section III. Section IV is devoted to the main part of our investigation, where a detailed proof of the fundamental theorem (3) is represented and the required assumptions for its validity are defined. A summary is finally given in section V. We shall use fairly standard notations of the STF tensor approach [13, 19, 20, 22, 36]:</p>

				<head>II. EINSTEIN&apos;S FIELD EQUATIONS</head>

				<p>The gravitation is described by 10 coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for the metric tensor, Einstein (1915,1916) [1, 2], which can be written in the form:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>R αβ − 1 2 g αβ R = 8 π G c 4 T αβ , (12)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>and which discover a fundamental relation between the metric of space-time and the matter field. Essentially, (12) represents a relation among contravariant tensors, of which R αβ is the Ricci curvature tensor, g αβ is the metric tensor with signature (− , + , + , +), and T αβ is the energy-momentum tensor of matter; R = R α α is the Ricci scalar of curvature. The field equations (12) are valid in any coordinate system, that means the coordinates are still arbitrary. For an asymptotically flat space-time, it is useful to decompose the metric tensor as follows:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>√ −g g αβ = η αβ − h αβ , (13)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where g is the determinant of metric tensor g αβ , h αβ is the metric perturbation which describes the deviation of the metric tensor of curved space-time from the metric tensor of Minkowskian flat space-time given by</p>

				</figure>

				<p>or by Eqs. (96.8) and (96.9) in [37]. The field equations (16) are exact and the gravitational field is not necessarily weak, because the only assumptions made so far are the decomposition (13) and the choice of a harmonic coordinate system (15).</p>

				</figure>

				<p>As it can be deduced from Eq. (16) and expansions (19) -(20), in harmonic gauge and up to terms of the order O (G 2 ), the Einstein&apos;s field equations are simplified to d&apos;Alembert&apos;s wave equation for each of the 10 components of the metric tensor, Einstein (1916) [8]</p>

				<p>which is called linearized gravity, a term which refers to the fact that the approximative field equations (21) are linear partial differential equations, to be contrary to the nonlinear exact field equations of gravity (12) or (16); recall the harmonic coordinates are denoted by (t, x).</p>

				<p>Actually, there are formally infinitely many solutions of wave equation (21). These solutions of (21) consist of a general solution of the homogeneous wave equation x h αβ hom = 0 plus one particular solution of inhomogeneous wave equation (21):</p>

				<p><formula>h αβ = h αβ hom + h αβ inhom .</formula></p>

				<p>For an unique solution of (21) one has to impose initial and boundary conditions. In case of an infinite space-time, there are no boundary conditions, and a well-posed problem (i.e. existence of one and only one unique solution) is given by the initial value problem at initial time t ′′ (Cauchy problem):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>h αβ hom (t ′′ , x ′′ ) , ∂ ∂c t ′′ h αβ hom (t ′′ , x ′′ ) . (22)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>These initial conditions are valid in the entire three-dimensional space. According to Kirchhoff &apos;s rigorous integration of the wave equation, Kirchhoff (1883) [38], an unique solution of (21) -(22) is given in terms of these initial conditions by an integral over an arbitrarily shaped but sufficiently smooth surface which contains completely the field point x and the spatially compact matter field described by the energy-momentum tensor T αβ ; an explicit expression of Kirchhoff &apos;s solution can be found, for instance, in Eq. (13) on page 420 in [39]. Here, without loss of generality, the surrounding surface ∂S is assumed to be the surface of a sphere S. Then, the unique solution of (21) -(22) can be written as follows:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>h αβ (t, x) = h αβ hom (t, x) + h αβ inhom (t, x) , (23) h αβ hom (t, x) = 1 4 π ∂S dΩ ′′ ∂ ∂r ′′ r ′′ h αβ hom (t ′′ , x ′′ ) + ∂ ∂ct ′′ r ′′ h αβ hom (t ′′ , x ′′ ) , (24) h αβ inhom (t, x) = 4 G c 4 t −∞ dt ′ V d 3 x ′ T αβ (t ′ , x ′ ) δ t ′ − t + |x ′ − x| c |x ′ − x| . (25) Here, δ (x) is Dirac&apos;s delta-distribution, normalized by +∞ −∞ dx δ (x) = 1. For a graphical elucidation of Eqs. (23) -(25) see Fig. 1</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>. According to (24), the solution of homogeneous wave equation is given by a surface integral over a sphere, while (25) is the particular solution of inhomogeneous wave equation which is called retarded solution. In (24) we use r ′′ = |x ′′ − x|, and for the retarded time between field point x and any point x ′′ on the surface of sphere we use t ′′ = t − r ′′ c . The homogeneous solution (24) contains the initial conditions (22), that means h αβ hom (t, x) in the whole space-time is uniquely determined by its initial values (22) on surface ∂S; cf. Eq. (9) in [26]. The surface integral is given in terms of spherical coordinates (r ′′ , θ ′′ , φ ′′ ) and the origin of the spherical coordinate system is located at the center of the sphere S, so that dΩ ′′ = sin θ ′′ dθ ′′ dφ ′′ . The integration in (24) runs over the surface with radius r ′′ .</p>

				<p>FIG. 1: Graphical representation of Kirchhoff &apos;s solution (23) -(25). The global reference frame with harmonic coordinates (t, x) is denoted by Σ (t, x). The vector x points from the origin of global coordinate system to the field point with spatial coordinate x. The matter field is described by an energy-momentum tensor T αβ . The matter field and the field point are enclosed by a virtual sphere S with surface ∂S. The center of the sphere is located at spatial coordinate x of the field point, so that the spatial distance between the field point and a point inside the matter field is given by |x ′ − x|, and the spatial distance between the field point and the surface ∂S is given by |x ′′ − x|. The matter field is assumed to be isolated, that means: 1. outside the region of some finite spatial volume V (gray colored) the matter field vanishes, and 2. there is no gravitational radiation from outside through the surface ∂S of sphere S. The metric field h αβ at field point (t, x) and at surface point (t ′′ , x ′′ ) has also been indicated.</p>

				<p>Physically, Kirchhoff &apos;s theorem [38] states that the homogeneous solution (24) is uniquely determined by source points which form a sphere with arbitrarily large radius r ′′ . We will assume that the matter source T αβ in (21) is isolated, that means the source is spatially compact and does not receive any radiation from other sources far away; note, however, that the matter source itself can emit gravitational radiation. Accordingly, since the radius of sphere S can be arbitrarily large, we are allowed to take the limit up to spatial infinity and can replace the initial conditions (22) by the so-called no-incoming-radiation condition, cf. Eq. (10) in [26], and cf.</p>

					<trash>h (t, x) = − ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds 1 2 (ct−r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y ˆ ∂ L (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r + ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds 1 2 (ct+r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y ˆ ∂ L (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r , (99)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>where a is an arbitrarily chosen constant which separates the region of integration variable y; in the first line in (99) the minus-sign in front of the integral takes into account that we have interchanged the upper and lower limits of integration. Now let us recall the fundamental theorem of integral calculus:</figDesc>
					<trash>d dx x a dy f (y) = f (y) y=x = f (x) . (100) The differential operator ∂ L in (99) contains terms like ∂ ∂x k = ∂r ∂x k</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>∂ ∂r . Accordingly, in the first line of (99) we can take the differential operator ∂ L in front of the integral, because the differentiation of the upper limit</figDesc>
					<trash>1 2 (ct − r − s) would yield a term (ct − r − s − 2y) l y= 1 2 (ct−r−s) = 0 , (101)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>due to the term (ct − r − s − 2y) l in the argument of the integral; the differentiation of the lower limit a gives zero because a is a constant. Thus, instead of (99) we can write</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>h (t, x) = − ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L 1 2 (ct−r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r + ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds 1 2 (ct+r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y ˆ ∂ L (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r . (102)</trash>

					<figDesc>Now let us consider the second line in (102), especially the term:</figDesc>
					<trash>ˆ ∂ L (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r = ˆ ∂ L    (ct − r) 2 − 2 (s + y) (ct − r) + s (s + 2y) l r    . (103)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We apply the following relation (for a proof of relation (104) see Appendix B, see also Eq. (A 36) in [20]):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ ∂ L (ct − r) i r = ˆ ∂ L (ct + r) i r if i = 0, 1, ..., 2l , (104) and obtain for (103) the expression ˆ ∂ L (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r = ˆ ∂ L    (ct + r) 2 − 2 (s + y) (ct + r) + s (s + 2y) l r    = ˆ ∂ L (ct + r − s) l (ct + r − s − 2y) l r . (105) Inserting (105) into (102) yields h (t, x) = − ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L 1 2 (ct−r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r + ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds 1 2 (ct+r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y ˆ ∂ L (ct + r − s) l (ct + r − s − 2y) l r . (106)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Now, also for the second line of (106) we can take the differential operator ∂ L in front of the integral, because the differentiation of the upper limit yields terms like (ct + r − s − 2y)</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>l y= 1 2 (ct+r−s) = 0 . (107) Accordingly, (106) can be written as follows: h (t, x) = − ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L 1 2 (ct−r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y (ct − r − s) l (ct − r − s − 2y) l r + ∞ l=0 4 π 2 l+1 l! ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L 1 2 (ct+r−s) a dy y l−1 T L s + y c , y (ct + r − s) l (ct + r − s − 2y) l r , (108)</trash>

					<figDesc>which is nothing else but relation (98). q.e.d.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>It is readily seen that the expression (98) can also be written as (cf. Eq. (6.4) in [20]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>)</figDesc>
					<trash>h (t, x) = −4 π ∞ l=0 ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L R a 1 2 (ct − r − s) , s − R a 1 2 (ct + r − s) , s r , (109)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>with the function (cf. Eq. (B.6) in [21])</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>R a (r, s) = r l r a dy (r − y) l l! 2 y l−1 T L s + y c , y . (110)</trash>

					<figDesc>Furthermore, by commuting the differential operator ∂ L with the integral of the first term in (109) (for the proof one can use the very same arguments as presented in detail in Proof 7), the expression (109) can be written as follows (see Eq. (6.8) in [20]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>or see Eq. (B.5) in [21]):</p>

				<p><formula>h (t, x) = − ∞ l=0 ∂ L 4π r ct−r −∞ ds R a ct − r − s 2 , s − ∞ l=0 ct−r −∞ ds ∂ L 4π r R a ct + r − s 2 , s . (111)</formula></p>

				<p>The solution (111) is independent of the choice of a. In case of a field point outside the source r &gt; r 0 , the first argument of the second term in (111) will satisfy 1 2 (ct + r − s) &gt; r 0 .</p>

				<p>Hence, if we choose a = r 0 it becomes evident from Eq. (110) that the second term in (111) will vanish when r &gt; r 0 , because the source is spatially compact (cf. Eq. (31); note that the sequence of transformations (55), (56) and (96) yields y = |x ′ |):</p>

				<p><formula>ˆ T L s + y c , y = 0 for y &gt; r 0 . (112)</formula></p>

				<p>This argumentation immediately yields (Eq. (B.7) in [21]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>)</figDesc>
					<trash>h (t, x) = ∞ l=0 (−1) l l! ˆ ∂ L ˆ F L (u) r , (113) with (cf. Eq. (B.8) in [21]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>)</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ F L (u) = −4π (−1) l u −∞ ds u − s 2 l (u−s)/2 r 0 dy u − s 2 − y l 2 y l−1 T L s + y c , y . (114)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>By a change of variables s = u + (z − 1) y, the expression (114) can be transformed into (cf. Eq. (B.9) in [21]):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ F L (u) = 4π 2 l+1 +1 −1 dz 1 − z 2 l r 0 0 dy y l+2 T L u + z y c , y . (115)</trash>

					<head>Proof 8:</head>

					<figDesc>We will show the validity of Eq. (115). Consider the expression given by Eq. (114):</figDesc>
					<trash>ˆ F L (u) = −4π (−1) l u −∞ ds u − s 2 l (u−s)/2 r0 dy u − s 2 − y l 2 y l−1 T L s + y c , y . (116) The transformation reads s = u + (z − 1) y , (117) and the differentials ds dy = ∂s ∂z ∂s ∂y ∂y ∂z ∂y ∂y dz dy = y dz dy . Thus, one obtains ˆ F L (u) = − 4π 2 l+1 u −∞ dz 1 − z 2 l (u−s)/2 r0 dy y l+2 T L u + z y c , y . (118)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Now we have to transform the integration limits. First, we take into account that (cf.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Eqs. (31) and (112)) ˆ T L u + z y c , y = 0 for y &gt; r 0 . (119) Consequently, we conclude y min = u − s 2 , y max = r 0 , (120) and write (118) as follows: ˆ F L (u) = 4π 2 l+1 zmax zmin dz 1 − z 2 l r0 (u−s)/2 dy y l+2 T L u + z y c , y . (121) From (117) we conclude z min = s min − u y max + 1 , z max = s max − u y min + 1 . (122)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>From (120) and taking into account the upper limit in (118), i.e. s ≤ u, we immediately get s min = u − 2 r 0 , s max = u .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(123) Then, by inserting (120) and (123) into (122), we obtain the limits: z min = −1 , z max = +1 . (124) Accordingly, the integral (121) reads ˆ F L (u) = 4 π 2 l+1 +1 −1 dz 1 − z 2 l r0 0 dy y l+2 T L u + z y c , y , (125)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which is just in coincidence with Eq. (115). q.e.d.</p>

				<p>Finally, we use the inversion of Eq. (51) (see Eq. (A9 b) in [20] or Eq. (B.10) in [21])</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ T L (t, y) = (2l + 1)!! 4 π l! 2 π 0 sin θ dθ π 0 dφ n L (θ, φ) T (t, y, θ, φ) . (126) Inserting (126) into (115), yields for (113) the following expression (cf. Eq. (B.2) in [21]) h (t, x) = ∞ l=0 (−1) l l! ∂ L ˆ F L (u) r , (127)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where r = |x| is the spatial distance between the origin of coordinate system and the field point. By a transformation from spherical coordinates y = (y, θ, φ) to</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Cartesian-like coordinates x ′ = (x ′ 1 , x ′ 2 , x ′ 3 ), the symmetric and tracefree multipole moments of the source are given by ˆ F L (u) = V d 3 x ′ ˆ x ′ L +1 −1 dz δ l (z) T u + z r ′ c , x ′ , (128)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the spatial integral runs over the volume V of the source, r ′ = |x ′ | is the spatial distance between the origin of coordinate system and a point inside the source with spatial coordinate x ′ , and u = ct − r, cf. Eq. (55).</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>In order to derive the form of Eq. (127), we also have used the relation ∂ L ˆ F L (u) = ∂ L ˆ F L (u) sincê F L are STF multipoles, that means the trace over any pair of indices in F L vanishes: e.g. for l = 2 we would havê</figDesc>
					<trash>∂ i 1 i 2 = ∂ 2 ∂x i 1 ∂x i 2 − δ i 1 i 2 3 ∂ 2 ∂r 2 , and due to δ i 1 i 2 ˆ F i 1 i 2 = 0, we havê ∂ i 1 i 2 ˆ F i 1 i 2 = ∂ i 1 i 2 ˆ F i 1 i 2 , and so on. The functions in (128) are given by δ l (z) = (2 l + 1)!! 2 l+1 l! 1 − z 2 l . (129) In view that h in (127) stands either for h 00 , h 0i , or h ij , while T in (128) stands either for 4 G c 4 T 00 , 4 G c 4 T 0i , or 4 G c 4 T ij , respectively, we can rewrite Eq. (127) and (128) in terms of their explicit tensorial structure: h αβ (t, x) = 4 G c 4 ∞ l=0 (−1) l l! ∂ L ˆ F αβ L (u) r , (130) where the STF multipoles are given by ˆ F αβ L (u) = V d 3 x ′ ˆ x ′ L +1 −1 dz δ l (z) T αβ u + z r ′ c , x ′ . (131)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The equations (130) and (131) represent the fundamental theorem of STF multipole expansion in post-Minkowskian approximation, as previously emphasized by Eqs. (3) -(4) in the introductory section. In virtue of equation (31) (compact support source) it is obvious that the multipole expansion (130) and (131) is valid for regions r &gt; r 0 , where r 0 is the radius of the smallest possible sphere which encloses completely the matter source. Finally, it should be noted that a straightforward application of theorem (127) and (128) for the case of electrodynamics leads immediately to the STF expansion given by Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) in [36].</p>

				<head>V. SUMMARY</head>

				<p>In linearized gravity the Einsteins field equations are given by an inhomogeneous partial differential equation (1) for each of the 10 components of the metric tensor. In the region exterior to the source the retarded solution (2) can be expanded in terms of 10 Cartesian STF multipoles in post-Minkowskian approximation: Eqs. (3) -(4) (= Eqs. (130) and (131)). These 10 multipoles in (4) are not independent of each other, because using energymomentum conservation (four relations) and gauge transformation (four relations) they can be reduced to finally 2 independent STF multipoles: mass multipoles and spin multipoles, ˆ M L and S L , respectively, in post-Newtonian approximation demonstrated by Thorne (1980) [19] and Blanchet &amp; Damour (1986,1989) [20, 21], while in post-Minkowskian approximation this fact has been established by Damour &amp; Iyer (1991) [36]. Meanwhile, the STF multipole expansion has become an important tool in linearized gravity and has demonstrated its efficiency for a wide spectrum of applications: in celestial mechanics [22–24], in the theory of gravitational waves [25–27], and in high precision astrometry where a particularly important aspect thereof is the theory of light propagation in curved space-time [28–31]. The theorem (3) -(4) is the fundamental theorem and the heart part of STF multipole expansion; see Eqs. (B.2) -(B.3) in [21], Eqs. (5.3) -(5.4) in [36], Eqs. (56) -(57) in [26], or Eq. (25) in [27]. But despite its formidable importance, an explicit proof of Eqs. (3) -(4) has not been presented so far, while some parts of the mathematical proof are distributed into several publications [11, 19–21]. In this investigation, a detailed proof of the STF multipole decomposition in form of a more didactical manuscript has been presented. Only three and rather weak assumptions are required for the validity of the STF multipole expansion:</p>

				<p>Appendix A: Proof of Eq. (82)</p>

				<p>Relation (82) contains only derivatives with respect to variable u, and since u and v are independent variables, here we can treat v as a constant. Accordingly, we introduce a new variable x = u − v with ∂ ∂x = ∂ ∂u , and rewrite relation (82) as follows:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>x 2 ∂ ∂x l (x + a) l (x + b) l x 2 l = x l+1 ∂ l ∂x l (x + a) l (x + b) l x l+1 , (A1)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where a = v − u ′ and b = v − v ′ , and the independent variable u ′ and v ′ are also considered as constant quantities. In order to show the validity of relation (A1) we apply the binomial theorem:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(x + a) l = l p=0 l p x l−p a p , (x + b) l = l q=0 l q x l−q b q , (A2) where the binomial coefficients are defined by l p = l! (l − p)! p! , l q = l! (l − q)! q! . (A3) Inserting (A2) into (A1) yields l p,q=0 l p l q a p b q x 2 ∂ ∂x l x l−p x l−q x 2 l = l p,q=0 l p l q a p b q x l+1 ∂ l ∂x l x l−p x l−q x l+1 . (A4)</trash>

					<figDesc>Let us consider each individual term in (A4). One can easily show the validity of the following both relations by means of mathematical induction:</figDesc>
					<trash>x 2 ∂ ∂x l x l−p x l−q x 2 l = (−1) l x −(p+q−l) l−1 k=0 (p + q − k) , (A5) x l+1 ∂ l ∂x l x l−p x l−q x l+1 = (−1) l x −(p+q−l) l−1 k=0 (p + q − k) . (A6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Accordingly, we can conclude the following identity for each individual term in (A4):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>x 2 ∂ ∂x l x l−p x l−q x 2 l = x l+1 ∂ l ∂x l x l−p x l−q x l+1 . (A7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>That means, each individual term on the left-hand side in (A4) coincides with the corresponding term on the right-hand side in (A4). Thus, we have shown the validity of relation (A4) and, therefore, the validity of relation (A1) and (82), respectively.</p>

				<p>Let us consider both expressions in (104), which we write as follows (for a proof of relation (B1) see Eqs. (85) -(88), while the proof of (B2) is very similar, see also relations (A35 b) and (A36 c) in [20]):</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ ∂ L (ct − r) n r = 2 l! ˆ n L (v − u) l ∂ 2l ∂u l ∂v l u n v − u , (B1) ˆ ∂ L (ct + r) n r = 2 l! ˆ n L (v − u) l ∂ 2l ∂u l ∂v l v n v − u , (B2) where u = ct − r and v = ct + r. By subtraction of (B1) from (B2) one obtains ˆ ∂ L (ct + r) n r − ˆ ∂ L (ct − r) n r = 2 l! ˆ n L (v − u) l ∂ 2l ∂u l ∂v l v n − u n v − u . (B3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Now we recall the generalized version of third binomial theorem,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>v n − u n v − u = n−1 j=0 v n−j−1 u j . (B4) Due to 2l ≥ n, the (2l) th derivative of the polynomial in (B4) yields zero: ∂ 2l ∂u l ∂v l v n − u n v − u = ∂ 2l ∂u l ∂v l n−1 j=0 v n−j−1 u j = 0 . (B5) Thus, inserting (B5) into (B3) yields ˆ ∂ L (ct + r) n r − ˆ ∂ L (ct − r) n r = 0 , (B6) which is just relation (104).</trash>

During the last decades, the STF multipole expansion has been established as a powerful tool in several fields of gravitational physics: celestial mechanics, theory of gravitational waves and in the theory of light propagation and astrometry. But despite its formidable importance, an explicit proof of the fundamental theorem of STF multipole expansion has not been presented thus far, while only some parts of it are distributed into several publications.
