				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Despite their importance for model building, orientifolds [1–3] have not been receiving the attention they deserve. One of the reasons is the lack of a well-developed mathematical structure into which orientifolds can be framed. This is in sharp contrast with the case of D-branes for oriented strings [4, 5], where the structure is extensively studied both from physics and from mathematics. One of the key discovery in the latter context is that the language of category fits very well and machinery of homological algebra can be applied effectively [6–8]. It is natural to ask whether this continues to be so also for unoriented strings.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>1</head>

				<p>In this paper, we approach this question by simply constructing the categories that are relevant for physics of unoriented strings. We do this in a class of very simple and tractable backgrounds — the Landau-Ginzburg models with N = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry. The realization that matrix factorization of the superpotential are the correct description of B-type D-branes has provided a simple model of the topological D-brane category that is at the same time concrete and tractable [12–17]. We will not here attempt a systematic foundation of the subject that can be applied to more general backgrounds, although we believe that such a treatment can be rather straightforwardly given based on our present results. Also, we note that Landau-Ginzburg models have an advantage in transition from the topological realm to the physical world, at nongeometric points in the Calabi-Yau moduli space. A basic program to achieve the same goal for geometric backgrounds was presented in the first part of [10] based on [11]. Without orientifold, where the complex Kähler moduli analytically connect Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and Calabi-Yau sigma models, the category of matrix factorizations is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the underlying algebraic variety. This was conjectured in [18] and the equivalences were constructed mathematically in [19] and are physically understood in [20]. It is very interesting to see the relation in the orientifold models where the Kähler moduli are projected to &quot; real &quot; locus.</p>

				<p>We will also develop a technology to compute correlation functions of topological field theory for unoriented worldsheets, generalizing the formulas for oriented worldsheets by Vafa for the closed strings [23] and of Kapustin-Li for open strings [14]. One of our main results in this paper is the construction of the crosscap states in</p>

				<p>Ginzburg models as well as in Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds where the parity is involutive only up to the orbifold group.</p>

				<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the worldsheet origins of B-type orientifolds of Landau-Ginzburg models [24, 25, 11]. In particular, we explain why the action of parity on matrix factorization is given by a &quot; graded transpose &quot; , as one could have naively anticipated: If a matrix squares to a scalar multiple of the identity, the transposed matrix will also do this. In section 3, we formulate a parity as an anti-involutive functor from the category of D-branes to itself, and then specialize to the category of matrix factorizations in LG models and their orbifolds. In our general classification of parities, we find the possibility for a &quot; twist by quantum symmetry &quot; in the definition of parity acting in Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. In section 4, we define an orientifold category as the fixed category under the parity functor with the additional requirement that the action of parity on the morphism spaces be involutive.</p>

				<p>This produces several (standard) results about possible gauge groups on D-branes in orientifolds. We emphasize that it does not make sense to restrict the morphism spaces themselves to their invariant subspaces, because this would not be compatible with the algebraic structure. We also include a discussion of the compatibility of orientifolding with R-charge grading, and hence D-brane stability, in the homogeneous case. In section 5, we compute topological crosscap correlators, both in theories with involutive parity (in other words, the parent theory is an ordinary Landau-Ginzburg, not an orbifold ), as well as in orientifolds of Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. The derivation includes a formula for the parity twisted Witten index in the open string sector between a brane and its orientifold image. We conclude with some comments in section 6.</p>

				<p>Some of the material in this paper was presented in [10] and [21]. We were informed by Emanuel Diaconescu of upcoming work by the Rutgers group which treats the problem of orientifold of derived category in the geometric regime.</p>

				<head n="2">Parity Actions on D-branes and Open Strings</head>

				<p>For a general discussion of parity symmetries in N = 2 supersymmetric worldsheet theories, we refer to [24]. Here, we will first recall a few basic facts about parities in N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg models, emphasizing the structure of the orientifold group.</p>

				<p>We will then analyze the action of parities on D-branes and open strings, first for general background and next in Landau-Ginzburg models. We find that &quot; graded transpose &quot; plays a relevant role. At the end of the section, we record basic notion and convention of Z 2 graded linear algebra.</p>

				<head n="2.1">Parity symmetries for closed strings</head>

				<p>As explained in [24], a B-type orientifold is defined from a parity P = τ Ω (2.1) where Ω is (B-type) (super)worldsheet parity, while τ is an action on target space variables. In a two-dimensional N = (2, 2) Landau-Ginzburg model, requiring that P be a symmetry means in particular that τ should act holomorphically on chiral field variables x such that the superpotential transforms with a minus sign</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>τ * W (x) = W (τ x) = −W (x) (2.2) This minus sign is required for the bosonic Lagrangian dθ + dθ − W (x) (2.3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>to be invariant under B-type parity dressed with τ [24]. The requirement that P be an involutive parity can be relaxed if we allow the bulk theory to be a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold. As explained by Douglas and Moore [27], the orientifold group is generically</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>an extension Γ −→ Γ π −→ Z 2 (2.4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In other words, a parity is any element P ∈ Γ such that π(P ) is the non-trivial element of Z 2 , while a general element g of the orbifold group Γ has trivial image in Z 2 . To be able to gauge Γ, we need P 2 ∈ Γ.</p>

				<p>In such a context, the action of P on the theory can have a dependence on the twisted sector on which it is acting, as explained for example in [25]. Concretely, this data is an element χ of the character group of Γ, and when acting on a state in the sector twisted by g, we include a phase factor χ(g). (This can be viewed as discrete-torsion like phases in the definition of the Klein bottle.)</p>

				<p>To classify such orientifolds, let us denote by G the symmetry group of W generated by phase symmetries and permutations of the variables. Although τ need not be a symmetry, the difference of two dressings is always in G. For simplicity, we will generally assume that Γ ⊂ G is an abelian orbifold group consisting just of phase symmetries. Possible quantum symmetries are elements of Γ * and for abelian Γ, form a group isomorphic to Γ. The group of symmetries of W/Γ is therefore</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>G Γ = (G/Γ) × Γ * ∼ = G (2.5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>To find the possible inequivalent orientifold dressings τ , for fixed orbifold group Γ, we must impose P ΓP −1 ⊂ Γ, P 2 ∈ Γ, as well as identify dressings which differ by conjugation by an element g ∈ G Γ . Since parity reverses the orientation of a string, it maps a string twisted by g ∈ Γ to a string twisted by g −1 . Therefore</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>P χP −1 = χ −1 (2.6) where χ −1 = ¯</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>χ is the character inverse to χ ∈ Γ * . As a consequence, we find that choices of inequivalent dressings correspond to involutive elements of G commuting with Γ as well as elements of Γ * mod(Γ * ) 2 . For examples, see [25].</p>

				<p>To make this section complete, we recall that when W is homogeneous,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W (e iλq i x i ) = e 2iλ W (x i ) , (2.7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>for some q i ∈ Q, there is a standard choice of orbifold group Γ ∼ = Z H (where H is the smallest integer such that Hq i ∈ 2Z for all i). Z H is generated by g corresponding to λ = π in (2.7). There is then also a standard choice of parity, corresponding to λ = π/2 in (2.7). We then have τ 2 = g, so τ actually generates the full orientifold group. But it should be remembered that this is not true in general: There can be elements of Γ which are not the square of any parity, and several parities can square to the same element of Γ.</p>

				<head n="2.2">Parity action on open strings — a general story</head>

				<p>The purpose of this section is to show that the parity action on open strings with Z 2 or Z graded Chan-Paton spaces is given by graded transpose (described below). This is extracted from the work [11].</p>

				<p>In general, an oriented string boundary carries a discrete degree of freedom represented in some complex vector space V , called a Chan-Paton (CP) space. If the orientation is flipped, the Chan-Paton space is replaced by its dual V * = Hom(V, C).</p>

				<p>Let us consider the open string worldsheet Σ = R×[0, π] where R and [0, π] are spanned by the time and the space coordinates, t and σ, respectively. We take the convention that the right boundary (σ = π) is oriented in the t-increasing direction while the left boundary (σ = 0) is oriented oppositely. Suppose that the left and the right boundary</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>σ σ t t π π 0 0 V W W V Ω</trash>

					<head>Figure 1:</head>

					<figDesc>Orientation reversal of the open string worldsheet</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>carry Chan-Paton spaces V and W respectively. (See the left part of Figure 1.) If we quantize the open string in such a way that the increase in t corresponds to positive time evolution, the space of states include a factor (Chan-Paton factor)</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>H CP = Hom(V, W ). (2.8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Now, if we consider the orientation reversal, Ω : (t, σ) −→ (t, π − σ), the left and the right boundaries are swapped and they are oppositely oriented compared to the standard convention we have chosen. Then the Chan-Paton factor is</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Ω(H CP ) = Hom(W * , V * ). (2.9) A parity operator includes a complex linear isomorphism P : Hom(V, W ) −→ Hom(W * , V * ). (2.10)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Up to automorphisms of V and W , a natural candidate is the transpose, P (φ) = φ t , defined by φ t f, v = f, φ(v), for f ∈ W * and v ∈ V .</p>

				<p>However, if V and W are graded vector spaces, it appears more natural to use the graded transpose P (φ) = φ T defined by φ T f, v = (−1) |f ||φ| f, φ(v).</p>

				<p>Here |f | = 0 when f is even and |f | = 1 if f is odd (similarly for |φ|). Namely, a sign appears whenever two &quot; fermionic &quot; objects swap their positions. In what follows, we confirm this guess using the case where the boundary degrees of freedom are complex (or even number of real) fermions.</p>

				<p>Suppose that the left and the right boundaries carry real fermions ξ j (j = 1, ..., 2m) and η a (a = 1, ..., 2n) respectively. The kinetic term of these variables is</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S boundary = ∞ −∞ dt 2n a=1 i 2 η a d dt η a + ∞ −∞ dt ′ 2m j=1 i 2 ξ j d dt ′ ξ j = ∞ −∞ dt 2n a=1 i 2 η a d dt η a − 2m j=1 i 2 ξ j d dt ξ j . (2.11)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the first line, t ′ is the time coordinate running in the opposite direction of t (t ′ = −t).</p>

				<p>The Chan-Paton factor on the right (resp. left) boundary is a graded irreducible representation M η (resp. M ξ ) of the Clifford algebra {η a , η b } = δ a,b (resp. {ξ i , ξ j } = δ i,j ) which is unique up to isomorphism. If we quantize the open string in the usual way, where t is the time, the Chan-Paton factor Hom(M ξ , M η ) must be a graded irreducible representation of the following anti-commutation relations: {â , ˆ η b } = δ a,b , { ˆ ξ i , ˆ ξ j } = −δ i,j , {â , ˆ ξ j } = 0. (2.12) It is indeed represented on Hom(M ξ , M η ) by ˆ η a φ := η a • φ, ˆ ξ i φ := (−1) φ φ • ξ i . (2.13)</p>

				<p>Note the unusual sign of thê ξ anticommutators in (2.12): it comes from the unusual sign of the ξ-kinetic term in (2.11). The sign factor (−1) φ in (2.13) is required to produce this sign as well as to satisfy the relation {â , ˆ ξ j } = 0.</p>

				<p>Let us operate the worldsheet orientation reversal Ω that swaps the two boundary lines. The Chan-Paton factor is then Hom(M * η , M * ξ ) since now η a is on the left boundary and ξ i on the right, both with the unconventional orientation. The kinetic term remains the same as (2.11) and they must still obey the anticommutaion relations (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>2.12), which must be represented in Hom(M * η , M * ξ ). The unique choice (up to isomorphism) is ˆ η a φ * := (−1) φ * φ * • η T a , ˆ ξ i φ * := ξ T i • φ * . (2.14) Here (−)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>T is the graded transpose, which is needed to obtain the correct sign for the anticommutation relation. Since we simply move η from right to left and ξ from left to right, the parity operator</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>P : Hom(M ξ , M η ) −→ Hom(M * η , M * ξ ) must obey P −1 η a P = ˆ η a , P −1 ξ i P = ˆ ξ i . Namely, P must commute with η and ξ. The graded transpose P (φ) = φ T (2.15) satisfies this condition, and it is unique up to scalar multiplication. 2.3 The case of Landau-Ginzburg models We now consider the parity operation for open strings in Landau-Ginzburg model. A B-type D-brane in the Landau-Ginzburg model is specified by a matrix factorization of the superpotential W (x 1 , ..., x n ), Q(x) = 0 f (x) g(x) 0 , Q(x) 2 = W (x)1 2r .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>It enters into the super-Wilson line factor P exp −i ∂Σ A t dt for the tachyon configuration T = Q + Q † of the space-filling brane-antibrane system [12]. To be explicit, it is [28–30] A</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>t = 1 2 {Q(x), Q(x) † } + 1 2 n i=1 ψ i ∂ ∂x i Q(x) + 1 2 n i=1 ∂ ∂x i Q(x) † ψ i where ψ i are the superpartners of the boundary values of x i . Provided Q(x) 2 = W (x)1 is satisfied, its supersymmetry variation is given by δA t = −Re n i=1 ǫψ i ∂ ∂x i W − iD t ǫQ + ǫQ † + i ˙ ǫQ + ˙ ǫQ † , (2.16) where D t X = ˙ X + i[A t , X]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>. The first term cancels the supersymmetry variation of the bulk action (the Warner term). The second term is a total derivative when inserted in the path-ordered exponentials. The last term shows that Q and Q † provides the boundary contribution to the supercharges.</p>

				<p>One important point is that Q and Q † are secretly fermionic — a sign must appear when a fermionic field ψ i , ψ i passes through them. We must keep track of such signs when we find out the parity action on matrix factorizations. Although it is possible to do so, we take another route: we consider matrix factorizations that can be realized using boundary fermions where the sign and the statistics are completely under control. For this purpose, it is enough to consider one-by-one factorizations where the super- Wilson-line factor is produced by the path-integral over a single complex boundary fermion η, η with the action (see e.g. [31])</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S right = ∞ −∞ dt iη d dt η − 1 2 |g(x)| 2 − 1 2 |f (x)| 2 − Re ηψ i ∂ i g(x) + ηψ i ∂ i f (x) σ=π , (2.17) and supersymmetry variation δη = −ǫf (x) − ǫg(x), δη = −ǫf (x) − ǫg(x). (2.18)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The subscript &quot; right &quot; emphasizes that it applies to the brane at the right boundary of the string which is oriented in the same direction as the time t. On the left boundary, which is oriented oppositely to t, the action and the variation are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S left = ∞ −∞ dt −iξ d dt ξ − 1 2 |˜ f(x)| 2 + Re ξψ i ∂ i ˜ g(x) + ξψ i ∂ i ˜ f(x) σ=0 , (2.19) δξ = ǫ ˜ f (x) − ǫ˜ξ = −ǫ f (x) + ǫ˜0 ) where ξ, ξ are a complex fermion, and ( ˜ f, ˜ g) is another factorization of W . 2 With these two boundary terms, the boundary part of the B-type supersymmetry charge is given by Q B = f (x)η + g(x)η σ=π − ˜ f (x)ξ + ˜ g(x)ξ σ=0 . (2.21)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In particular, using (2.13), we find that this acts on the CP factor Hom(M ξ , M η ) by Q B φ = Q • φ − (−1) φ φ • Q.</p>

				<p>Now, let us perform the parity τ Ω. Then the left and the right boundary lines are</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>swapped, and (f, g) and ( ˜ f, ˜ g) are replaced by (τ * f, τ * g) and (τ * ˜ f , τ * ˜ g). As a consequence , the boundary part of the B-type supercharge is now Q B = f (τ x)η + g(τ x)η σ=0 − ˜ f(τ x)ξ + ˜ g(τ x)ξ σ=π (2.22) Using (2.14), we see that it acts on the Chan-Paton factor Hom(M * η , M * ξ ) as Q B φ * = −τ * ˜ Q T • φ * + (−1) φ * φ * • τ * Q T , (2.23) where (−)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>T is the graded transpose. We see that the matrix factorization on the right and the left boundaries are now −τ * ˜ Q T and −τ * Q T .</p>

				<p>Let us summarize what we found: Under the simple orientation reversal of the worldsheet, a matrix factorization transforms as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Q(x) −→ −Q(τ x) T , (2.24) while open string wavefunctions transform as φ(x) −→ φ(τ x) T . (2.25)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In these expressions, (−) T stands for the graded transpose.</p>

				<head n="2.4">Dual and transpose for graded vector spaces</head>

				<p>Since the graded transpose plays an important role, we record below a few basic notions and conventions regarding Z 2 graded linear algebra. In LG models, it is more convenient to regard the Chan-Paton spaces as (free) modules over the ring C[x 1 , ..., x n ], term (it we had quantized by taking −t as the time, it would have had the standard relation). Thus, the two variations in (2.20) are consistent with reality, and also the &quot; real part &quot; in (2.19) must be with respect to such a reality. rather than complex vector spaces. But we describe everything in the category of complex vector spaces because generalization to modules over the ring is straightforward.</p>

				<p>So Let M be a Z 2 graded (finite-dimensional, complex) vector space with grading operator σ which acts as 1 on even elements and −1 on odd elements. The dual vector space M * = Hom(M, C) is naturally graded by σ * f, e = f, σe. Here, we use ·, · to denote the natural pairing M * × M → C. It is worthwhile emphasizing that despite appearances, this pairing is neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric in any sense. In fact, there is no preference between thinking of the pairing as a map M * × M → C or as a map M × M * → C.</p>

				<p>Let us now consider a linear map A : M 1 → M 2 between graded vector spaces</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(M 1 , σ 1 ) and (M 2 , σ 2 ). If A is even (resp. odd), we denote |A| = 0 (resp. |A| = 1) modulo 2. We define the (graded) transpose of A as a linear map A T : M * 2 → M * 1 by setting A T f 2 , e 1 = (−1) |A||f 2 | f 2 , Ae 1 , (2.26)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>if A is even or odd. If A is a linear isomorphism A T is also an isomorphism. The transpose of the inverse and the inverse of the transpose are related by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(A −1 ) T = (−1) |A| (A T ) −1 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>If A is even, they are the same and we sometimes use the shorthand notation A</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>−T = (A −1 ) T = (A T ) −1 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We wish to emphasize that the definition (2.26) in fact constitutes a choice, and we could have equally well defined</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>T Af 2 , e 1 = (−1) |A||e 1 | f 2 , Ae 1 (2.27)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The latter choice is in fact the natural one if we prefer to pair a vector space and its dual in the opposite order. Of course,</p>

				<p>A = (−1) |A| A T , and one can check that none of our results depend on the choice. Having said that, we will fix the graded transpose defined by (2.26). Let us describe some of its properties.</p>

				<p>Tensor product It is also important to study and fix our convention on tensor products. Let (M 1 , σ 1 ) and (M 2 , σ 2 ) be graded vector spaces. The tensor product M 1 ⊗ M 2 has a natural grading σ 12 = σ 1 ⊗ σ 2 . Its dual is identified with M</p>

				<p>, in a theory of oriented strings the collection of all D-branes forms a category C (to be precise, in a slightly generalized sense). Objects of C are Dbranes , B i , the space of morphisms between two objects, Hom(B 1 , B 2 ), is the space of states of the open string stretched from the brane B 1 to the brane B 2 .

				<head n="3.1">The category of matrix factorizations</head>

				<p>As discussed above, the data to specify a B-brane in the LG model is a matrix factorization Q(x) of the superpotential W (x). This can be interpreted as an open string tachyon configuration on a stack of equal numbers of space filling branes and antibranes . We regard this as a triple</p>

				</figure>

				<p>This is of course nothing else but the original orbifold construction of [27], actually with the simplification that all branes, being space filling, are invariant under Γ. Therefore, we only have an action on the Chan-Paton space M together with the action on closed string variables. Thus, a B-brane in the LG orbifold is specified by the data</p>

					<trash>(M, σ, Q, ρ). (3.5) For a pair branes given by such data, (M 1 , σ 1 , Q 1 , ρ 1 ) and (M 2 , σ 2 , Q 2 , ρ 2 ), the space of open strings between them is given by the Γ-invariant homomorphisms Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) Γ with respect to the action g ∈ Γ : φ → ρ 2 (g)g * φρ 1 (g) −1 . These data form a differential graded category MF Γ (W ) and we denote its homotopy category by MF Γ (W ) which is again triangulated. The group Γ * of quantum symmetries acts as the auto-equivalence of these categories by (M, σ, Q, ρ) → (M, σ, Q, g * (ρ)), where (g * (ρ))(g) = g * (g) ρ(g) for g * ∈ Γ * , g ∈ Γ. 3.2 The parity functors</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Let us now define the parity functors on these categories. We first consider the case without orbifold. An example is already found in section 2.3: a matrix factorization Q(x) is sent to −Q(τ x) T and a morphism φ(x) is mapped to φ(</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>τ ) T , see Eqn (2.24) and Eqn. (2.25). Thus, we propose to define a functor P : MF (W ) → MF (W ) by (M, σ, Q) −→ (M * , σ T , −τ * Q T ), Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) ∋ φ −→ τ * φ T ∈ Hom S (M * 2 , M * 1 ). (3.6) It meets the conditions: • P(M, σ, Q) is a matrix factorization of W (−τ * Q T ) 2 = τ * Q T τ * Q T = −(τ * Qτ * Q) T = −(τ * W · id M ) T = −(−W ) · id M * = W · id M * , (3.7) where we have used (2.31) in the second equality and also (2.2) in the fourth. • It commutes with the supercharge: For φ ∈ Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) which is either even or odd, σ 2 φσ 1 = (−1) |φ| φ, we have dP(φ) = (−τ * Q T 1 )τ * φ T − (−1) |φ| τ * φ T (−τ * Q T 2 ) = −(−1) |φ| (τ * φτ * Q 1 ) T + (τ * Q 2 τ * φ) T = τ * (Q 2 φ − (−1) |φ| φQ 1 ) T = P(dφ) (3.8) • It is compatible with the composition: For φ ∈ Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) and ψ ∈ Hom S (M 2 , M 3 ), their composition ψφ ∈ Hom S (M 1 , M 3 ) is mapped to P(ψφ) = τ * (ψφ) T = (−1) |ψ||φ| τ * φ T τ * ψ T = (−1) |ψ||φ| P(φ)P(ψ). (3.9) • The square of P does P 2 : (M, σ, Q) −→ (M * * , σ T T , τ * (τ * Q T ) T ) = (M * * , σ T T , Q T T ), P 2 : Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) ∋ φ −→ φ T T ∈ Hom S (M * * 1 , M * * 2 ). (3.10) Using the relation (2.37), we see that the canonical isomorphism ι : M → M * * provides an isomorphism of P 2 to the identity, ι : P ∼ = −→ id MF (W ) .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Thus, P is an anti-involution of the differential graded category MF (W ). As a consequence, it descends to a functor of the homotopy category MF(W ). Namely, P defines a map of d-cohomology classes by the property (3.8).</p>

				<p>One may obtain other parity functors by composing the above P with some other auto-equivalence of MF (W ). For example, MF (W ) has antibrane functor A that sends (M, σ, Q) to (M, −σ, Q). Let us examine the composition AP</p>

					<trash>:= A • P AP : (M, σ, Q) −→ (M * , −σ T , −τ * Q T ).</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The transpose &quot; T &quot; is with respect to the grading σ. It is easy to see that it is a matrix factorization of W , and that dAP(φ) = AP(dφ) for any open string state φ.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>The square of AP does (AP) 2 : (M, σ, Q) −→ (M * * , σ T T , −Q T T ), (AP) 2 : Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) ∋ φ −→ (σ 2 φσ 1 ) T T ∈ Hom S (M * * 1 , M * * 2 ) (3.11) where we have used (2.30). We see that ι • σ : M → M * * provides an isomorphism of (AP) 2 to the identity. 3.3 LG orbifolds</trash>

					<figDesc>Let us next consider the orbifold of the LG model by a finite abelian group Γ that preserves the superpotential, g * W = W for all g ∈ Γ. We suppose that an abelian extension of Z 2 by Γ 1 −→ Γ −→ Γ −→ Z 2 −→ 1, also acts on the variables, so that elements τ ∈ Γ outside of Γ flip the sign of W , τ * W = −W . One can consider a parity symmetry associated with the group Γ/Γ.</figDesc>

				<p>We would like to find parity actions on B-branes and open string states. The requirement is as before — we seek anti-involutions of the categories MF</p>

					<trash>Γ (W ) and MF Γ (W ). Let us choose any odd element τ ∈ Γ \ Γ, and consider P(τ ) : (M, σ, Q, ρ) −→ (M * , σ T , −τ * Q T , ρ −T ).

					<figDesc>The square of P(τ ) is isomorphic to the identity by the canonical isomorphism ι : M → M * * . It commutes with the supercharge and thus the functor descends to the homotopy category. For any g ∈ Γ, P(τ g) is isomorphic to P(τ ) by ρ(g) : M → M.</figDesc>

				<p>However, it may appear unpleasant that we need to make a choice of τ ∈ Γ \ Γ. This worry actually disappears when we appropriately define the D-brane category in the orientifold. See Section 4.2.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>So far, we have discussed parity as an anti-involution of the category of D-branes. In constructing an orientifold background in string theory, we intend to promote parity from a global symmetry to a gauge symmetry. In particular, we want to include into the background a configuration of D-branes that is invariant by the parity, and classify open string states with specific transformation properties under the parity. This motivates us to consider a new category of D-branes, whose objects are invariant brane configurations or simply invariant branes. Let C be a category of D-branes with a parity functor P. An invariant brane is a brane B with an isomorphism</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>U : P(B) −→ B. (4.1) For a pair of invariant branes, (B 1 , U 1 ) and (B 2 , U 2 ), there is a linear map P : Hom(B 1 , B 2 ) P −→ Hom(P(B 2 ), P(B 1 )) U 1 ·(?)·U −1 2 −→ Hom(B 2 , B 1 ). (4.2) We require that this linear map be an involution P • P = id Hom(B 1 ,B 2 ) . (4.3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In order to impose orientifold projection, we want P 2 to be literally the identity operator of the space of states Hom(B 1 , B 2 ). (It is not enough for P 2 to be isomorphic to the identify.) This is a rather strong condition on the collection of invariant objects (B, U).</p>

				<p>It is possible that, for each functor P, there are several categories consisting of invariant branes that are mutually compatible in the sense that (4.3) holds for any pair. As for the morphisms in the new categories, the best choice is to keep all morphisms from before the orientifold, as we will discuss below.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this section is to show that one can indeed define such categories and to classify them, in Landau-Ginzburg models and their orbifolds.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We start with the unorbifolded Landau-Ginzburg model with an involution x → τ x such that W (τ x) = −W (x). As the parity functor, let us first take P = P defined in (3.6). An invariant brane is a quadruple (M, σ, Q, U) where (M, σ, Q) is a matrix factorization of W (x) and U is a linear isomorphism</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>U : M * −→ M, (4.4) such that Uσ T U −1 = σ, U(−τ * Q T )U −1 = Q. (4.5) For a pair of such branes, (M 1 , σ 1 , Q 1 , U 1 ) and (M 2 , σ 2 , Q 2 , U 2 ), the parity transformation of the open string states is defined according to (4.2): P : φ ∈ Hom S (M 1 , M 2 ) −→ U 1 τ * φ T U −1 2 ∈ Hom S (M 2 , M 1 ). (4.6) The square of P is given by P 2 (φ) = U 2 τ * (U 1 τ * φ T U −1 2 ) T U −1 1 = U 2 U −T 2 φ T T U T 1 U −1 1 = U 2 U −T 2 ι 2 φι −1 1 U T 1 U −1 1 , where φ T T = ι 2 φι −1 1</trash>

					<figDesc>is used in the last step (see (2.37)). We require that the right hand side equals φ itself for any φ ∈ Hom S (M 1</figDesc>
					<trash>, M 2 ). By Schur&apos;s Lemma, this means that U 2 U −T 2 ι 2 and U 1 U −T 1 ι 1</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>are the same matrix which is proportional to the identity. Thus, we find that, in a category of mutually compatible branes, we have UU −T ι = ǫ · id M (4.7) where ǫ is a constant that is independent of the brane in that category.</p>

					<trash>Using U = ǫι −1 U T twice and employing the relation ι −1 U T T ι −T = U, we find that ǫ 2 = 1.</trash>

				<p>In orientifolding a LG orbifold, we consider the parity functor&apos;s P = P χ (τ )&apos;s introduced in (3.14). An invariant brane is a quintuple (M, σ, Q, ρ, U) where (M, σ, Q, ρ) is an object of MF Γ (W ) and U assigns to each odd element τ ∈ Γ an isomorphism</p>

				<p>Because of the relation (4.10) this is independent of the choice of τ . At this stage, we require that P χ be involutive on the equivariant category. As before, the content of the requirement is found by computing P 2 χ , and yields the condition that</p>

				<head n="4.3">Invariant branes from irreducible ones</head>

				<p>We have seen that in both LG model and LG orbifold, the possible D-brane categories for a given parity are classified by a sign: ǫ = ±1 in (4.7) for the model without orbifold, and for orbifold c(τ ) in (4.12) admits only two possibilities: say, c(τ ) = c 0 (τ ) or c(τ ) = −c 0 (τ ). These signs are actually the standard sign ambiguity for the orientifold projection in the open string sector.</p>

				<p>To see this, we study irreducible branes in the orbifold theory and stacks of them that can or cannot be members of one of these categories. Let B = (M, σ, Q, ρ) be an irreducible matrix factorization. By definition, &quot; irreducible &quot; means that there is no subspace of M that is invariant under both ρ and Q. Suppose it is also invariant under the parities P χ (τ ) for τ ∈ Γ. Namely, there is an U(τ ) : M * → M that obey (4.</p>

				<p>It is this sign, ǫ ext , which decides whether the gauge group on Q is of symplectic or orthogonal type.

				<p>For completeness, we also consider the case where the irreducible brane B = (M, σ, Q, ρ) is not invariant, i.e. there is no U(τ ) : M * → M that obey (4.9) and (4.10).

				<p>The peculiarity of parity (as compared with other discrete symmetries) is that it does not define an automorphism of the operator algebra of open strings, but rather an anti-automorphism. Namely, parity reverses the cyclic ordering of operators inserted on the boundary of the worldsheet. See Fig. 2. As a consequence, parity does not impose any selection rule on worldsheet correlators with more than two boundary insertions. (For just two insertions, which defines the topological metric, parity does yield a selection rule.) If these statements come as a surprise, we hasten to emphasize that of course in full string theory, orientifolding does define a projection that is consistent with string interactions. This is a consequence of integrating over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, and in particular, summing over the ordering of operators on the boundary.</p>

				<p>Nevertheless, even if the topological field theory does not admit the &quot; orientifold projection &quot; , we can still learn about the effect of this projection in the string background built on the parity of our Landau-Ginzburg model. Consider strings from one</p>

				<p>This equivalence being odd is in contradiction to our definition (4.5), and hence the mapped object is not in MF ±ǫ P (W ).

				<p>We expect that when the critical points of W are isolated, the integral (5.6) localizes further. Namely, we expect a sum over critical points of W , the contribution of each of which is obtained in the linear approximation. This is how the computation was done in [23] in the oriented case, and in [14,16] in the presence of boundaries. Namely, first the superpotential is resolved by addition of relevant deformations, and then the result of that computation is continued to the degenerate case. To proceed along these lines in the present situation, we should deform the superpotential in such a way as to preserve the condition τ (W ) = −W . It is reasonable to assume that there always exists such a deformation which completely resolves the superpotential.</p>

				<p>Let us then assume that the critical points of W are isolated. Any given critical point can be invariant under τ or it can be mapped to another critical point. Only the invariant critical points contribute to (5.6). Let us consider the contribution from one of them. We note that from ∂ i W (x) = −∂ i W (τ x) = −(∂ j W )(τ x)τ j i , it follows that at an invariant critical point, |∂W | 2 = |∂ ⊥ W | 2 where ∂ ⊥ is the derivative in the direction perpendicular to the fixed locus of τ .

				<p>As we have mentioned, if W is degenerate, we should first deform it such that parity is respected and such that all the critical points of W are isolated. By continuity, the formula (5.14) will then hold also in the degenerate case. We now proceed to check this in examples.</p>

				<p>Charges and index theorem in general Landau-Ginzburg orientifolds We now turn to the general case of Landau-Ginzburg orientifold, in which the orientifold group is an extension of the form (2.4).</p>

				<p>We wish to compute the parity twisted index Tr(−1) F P in the open string sector between a matrix factorization (M, σ, Q, ρ) and its parity image. We recall that a parity sends a brane based on a module M to a brane based on the dual M * . Thus we are considering a parity operator that maps Hom S (M, M * ) to Hom S (M * * , M * ). But in order to take the trace, we need to have an operator that acts on the same space.</p>

				<p>In other words, we need to make a choice of relating M * * to M. The canonical one ι : M → M * * is defined in (2.35), but this is just one choice and one has to check that it is consistent with everything.</p>

				<p>This difficulty is cleanly solved if we use one of the categories introduced in Section 4. Let us consider the category MF</p>

				<head>c</head>

				<p>Pχ (W ) where P χ is the parity functor defined in (3.14) and c is the function c(τ ) obeying the equation (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>4.13) and (4.14). Then, we consider the invariant brane ( ˆ M, ˆ σ, ˆ Q, ˆ ρ, ˆ U) in this category that includes M as a part, as M = M ⊕ M * . Thus, we take V = C (N = 1) and we set α(τ ) = c(τ ) in (4.19) and (4.20). Then the parity operator P χ maps Hom S ( ˆ M, ˆ M ) to itself and sends the subspace Hom S (M, M * ) ⊂ Hom S ( ˆ M , ˆ M) to itself.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Then there is no ambiguity in defining the trace.</p>

				<p>Concretely, the requisite isomorphism is given by ρ(τ 2 )c(τ )ι −1 : M * * → M, where ι is the canonical isomorphism (2.35). With these definitions, the parity image (in</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Hom S (M, M * )) of a morphism Φ ∈ Hom S (M, M * ) is P (Φ)(x) = Φ T (τ x)ιc(τ ) −1 ρ(τ 2 ) −1 (5.29)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>To compute the index Tr(−1) F P , we proceed as in [18]. Namely, we choose a regularization such that we can compute the index on the complex instead of on the cohomology. A useful basis for the morphisms in Hom R (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M, M * ) is Φ(x) = ij,α Φ ij α e ij x α (5.30)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where α = (α 1 , . . . , α r ) is a multi-index. Let us assume, as in section 4.6, that τ is a phase rotation combined with at most an order two permutation of the variables, namely, τ (x α ) = τ α x τ (α) , where τ α is a phase. Parity then acts on basis elements as P (e ij x α ) = e ji σ i+j τ α x τ (α) . (See section 2.4 and in particular eqs. (2.28) and (2.29) for conventions.)</p>

				<p>Taking the trace over morphism space requires summing over i = j and α = τ (α).</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>In this sector, (−1) F = 1 and hence we have Tr(−1) F P = j σ j c(τ ) −1 ρ(τ 2 ) −1 jj α=τ (α) τ α (5.31)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where σ j originates from the fact that in the matrix representation, (2.36), ι can be identified with σ.</p>

				<p>Generally, we can separate the variables into those, x</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>u 1 , x u 2 , . . . , x u rτ with τ 2 i = 1</trash>

					<figDesc>(untwisted ones) and the remaining ones with τ 2</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>i = 1 (twisted ones). Let us first assume that there are no untwisted variables. Actually, let us assume that the action of τ has been diagonalized. The result is then simply</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Tr(−1) F P = Strρ(τ 2 ) −1 c(τ ) −1 i (1 − τ i ) (5.32)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>When there are untwisted variables, Tr(−1) F P can be computed by combining the present method with the results from subsection 5.1, see eq. (5.28). This is again similar to [18]. Namely, we can contemplate an &quot; effective &quot; Landau-Ginzburg model with superpotential W τ obtained from W by setting all twisted variables to zero. If we also set the twisted variables to zero in Q, we obtain an effective factorization Q τ of W τ . The parity acting in this sector squares to 1, so the results of subsection 5.1 are applicable. Defining C τ for example by the formula (5.17) (or by zero when Trτ = 0 in this sector), the index formula takes the form</p>

				<p>Using these formulas, it is a simple matter to implement the orbifold projection on</p>

				<head n="6">Concluding Remarks</head>

				<p>In this paper, we have studied parity functors and constructed associated orientifold categories of D-branes in a specific class of backgrounds, Landau-Ginzburg models.</p>

				<p>However, the basic procedure found in this paper can be applied more generally. See the beginning of Section 4. We first choose a parity, an anti-involution of the category of D-branes. This allows us to consider invariant objects; an invariant object is a brane whose parity image is isomorphic to itself where the isomorphism is included as a part of the data. For each pair of invariant objects, we can also consider a parity operator whose square is an automorphism of the space of states. We then classify invariant objects in such a way that the parity operators are involutive for the members of one class. Invariant objects of each class form an orientifold category. We decide to keep all morphisms of the original category as the morphism of the orientifold category. What we found in Landau-Ginzburg models is that there are exactly two classes, hence two categories, for each parity functor.</p>

				<p>This is reminiscent of Hermitian K-theory 4 which can be defined for an algebra A over some field k with an anti-involution (an anti-involution is a k-linear automorphism of A, a → a, such that ab = ba). The construction goes as follows. Let M be a right A-module. Its dual M t is defined as the set of all k-linear maps σ : M → A such that σ(ma) = aσ(m), which is again a right A-module. The double dual is canonically isomorphic to the original, ι : (M t ) t → M, ι(m)(σ) := σ(m). Then, Hermitian Ktheory KQ ε (A) is the Grothendieck group of the pair (M, U) where U : M t → M is an isomorphism of A-modules such that U(U t ) −1 ι = ε.</p>

				<p>Again, there is a sign ambiguity for ε. If we take as A the (commutative) algebra over C of continuous complex-valued functions of a topological space X with an involution τ , with f(x) := f (τ x), then the Hermitian K-theories with ε = ±1 are nothing but Real K-theories KR(X), KR −4 (X) of Atiyah [38]. Since KR-theory classifies D-brane charges in geometric orientifolds [39], it is clear that the structure contained in Hermitian Ktheory plays an essential role in the holomorphic description of D-branes for orientifold. (This is essentially a part of the proposal in [10].)</p>

				<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting problems for future work is the connection to large volume. As discussed in the introduction, for oriented strings, Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and Calabi-Yau sigma models are connected over the moduli space of the complexified Kähler class, and the category of matrix factorizations is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the underlying algebraic variety. Given the recent understanding of the equivalence [20] (based on the conjecture of [18] and the construction of [19]), it is very interesting to see such a relation in the orientifold models, and to understand peculiar properties of D-branes which were discovered sporadically in examples, such as the type change via navigation through non-geometric regimes [25]. Note that the Kähler moduli is projected to &quot; real &quot; locus and also we expect the (discrete) B-field to play important roles in determining the structure of Chan- Paton factors [24].
