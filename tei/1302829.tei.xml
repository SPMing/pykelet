				<p>Observed particles of integer spin obey Bose-Einstein statistics and are quantized using the commutation relations, and those of half-odd-integer spin obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and are quantized using the anti-commutation relations. These properties are explained under conditions such as the positivity of energy, the microscopic causality and the positive-definiteness of norm in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory, and is known as the spin-statistics theorem [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].</p>

				<p>Although it is taken for granted that such a connection between spin and statistics exists in nature, it is not so clear what happens when particles are quantized by imposing abnormal relations on. There seems to be a confusion or the absence of common understanding on which condition is essential to the theorem or incompatible with abnormal relations. It might cause mainly from the difference of setup or preconditions, and hence model-dependent analyses would be useful to avoid ambiguities and to help a deeper understanding of spin and statistics. From this viewpoint, we deal with explicit models at the expense of a generality, taking a clue from the features of Faddeev-Popov ghost fields.</p>

				<p>Faddeev-Popov ghost fields are hermitian scalar fields appearing on the quantization of gauge theories, and follow the anti-commutation relations [12]. They have positive energies and respect the causality but generate states with negative norms. It is natural to expect that these features are shared in a wide class of models. Actually, Fujikawa has studied the spin-statistics theorem in the path integral formalism, with expressions of the operator formalism, and pointed out that the causality is ensured regardless of statistics and the positive norm condition is crucial to the theorem [13]. 1 Our study is regarded as a manifestation of the statement based on explicit models in the operator formalism.</p>

				<p>In this paper, we reexamine the connection between spin and statistics through the quantization of a complex scalar field. Starting from an ordinary Lagrangian density and imposing the anti-commutation relations on the scalar field, we find that the difficulty stems from not the ill-definiteness (or unboundedness) of the energy and the breakdown of the causality but the appearance of states with negative norms. We refer to such an abnormal scalar field as a &apos;fermionic scalar field&apos;. The difficulty is overcome by introducing an ordinary scalar field to form a doublet of fermionic symmetries, although the system becomes empty leaving the vacuum state alone. These features also hold for the system with a spinor field imposing the commutation relations on. We refer to such an abnormal spinor field as a &apos;bosonic spinor field&apos;. As a by-product, we construct analytical mechanics in the form with the manifestly hermitian property such that the hermitian conjugate of canonical momentum for a variable is just the canonical momentum for the hermitian conjugate of the variable. The contents of this paper are as follows. In Sec. II, we study the system with harmonic oscillators imposing the anti-commutation relations on variables, as a warm-up. In Sec. III, we examine the system of a fermionic scalar field and clarify the difficulty on quantization. We investigate the system containing both an ordinary complex scalar field and a fermionic one. Section IV is devoted to conclusions and discussions. Appendices also contains new ingredients. In Appendix A, we present useful formulas of differentiation for variables and a new definition of the canonical momenta, the Hamiltonian and the Noether charge, and develop analytical mechanics for the system containing both bosonic and fermionic non-hermitian variables. In Appendix B, we study the system of a bosonic spinor field and clarify the difficulty on quantization.</p>

				<p>First, we consider the systems of harmonic oscillators in quantum mechanics, because they have features in common with those of scalar fields and its study facilitates the understanding of a difficulty and a remedy appearing in a case with abnormal quantization rules in quantum field theory.</p>

				<p>For the sake of completeness, let us begin with the system described by the Lagrangian,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L q = m ˙ q † ˙ q − mω 2 q † q , (1)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where q = q(t ) is a coordinate taking complex numbers, q † its hermitian conjugate, ˙ q = d q/d t , and ω is an angular frequency. The Euler-Lagrange equations for q and q</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>† are given by m d 2 q † d t 2 = −mω 2 q † , m d 2 q d t 2 = −mω 2 q , (2)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>respectively. They describe two harmonic oscillators with the same mass m.</p>

				<p>According to Appendix A, let us define the canonical conjugate momenta of q</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>and q † as p ≡ ∂L q ∂ ˙ q R = m ˙ q † , p † ≡ ∂L q ∂ ˙ q † L = m ˙ q , (3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>respectively. Here, R and L stand for the right-differentiation and the left-differentiation, respectively.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>By solving (2) and (3), we obtain the solutions q(t ) = ħ 2mω ae −i ωt + b † e i ωt , q † (t ) = ħ 2mω a † e i ωt + be −i ωt , (4) p(t ) = i ħmω 2 a † e i ωt − be −i ωt , p † (t ) = −i ħmω 2 ae −i ωt − b † e i ωt , (5) where a, b † , a † and b are some constants. Using (3) and (158), the Hamiltonian is obtained as H q = p ˙ q + ˙ q † p † − L = 1 m pp † + mω 2 q † q . (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Later, we will comment on a consequence of a difference between H q and the ordinary Hamiltonian defined by only the right-differentiation.</p>

				<p>The system is quantized by regarding variables as operators and imposing the following commutation relations on the canonical pairs (q,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>p) and (q † , p † ), [q(t ), p(t )] = i ħ , [q † (t ), p † (t )] = i ħ , [q(t ), p † (t )] = 0 , [q † (t ), p(t )] = 0 , [q(t ), q † (t )] = 0 , [p(t ), p † (t )] = 0 , (7) where [A, B]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>≡ AB − B A. Or equivalently, for operators a, b † , a † and b, the following relations are imposed on, [a, a † ] = 1 , [b, b † ] = 1 , [a, b] = 0 , [a † , b † ] = 0 , [a, b † ] = 0 , [a † , b] = 0 . (8)</p>

				<p>In quantum theory, an operator O = O(t ) evolves by the Heisenberg equation,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>dO d t = i ħ [H,O] , (9) where H is the Hamiltonian. From (6), (7) and (9), the following equations are derived d q d t = i ħ [H q , q] = p † m , d q † d t = i ħ [H q , q † ] = p m , (10) d p d t = i ħ [H q , p] = −mω 2 q † , d p † d t = i ħ [H q , p † ] = −mω 2 q , (11) where we use the relation among operators A, B and C : [AB,C ] = A[B,C ] + [A,C ]B . (12) (10) and (11) are equivalent to (2) and (3). By inserting (4) and (5) into (6), H q is written by H q = ħω a † a + bb † = ħω a † a + b † b + 1 , (13) where we use [b, b † ]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>= 1 to derive the last expression and the constant part ħω is the zero-point energy. The eigenstates and eigenvalues of H q are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>|n a , n b 〉 = (a † ) n a n a ! (b † ) n b n b ! |0, 0〉 ; E n a ,n b = ħω (n a + n b + 1) , (14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where n a , n b = 0, 1, 2 · · · and |0, 0〉 is the ground state that satisfies a|0, 0〉 = 0 and b|0, 0〉 = 0. We find that the values of E n a ,n b are positive. Using (8), the inner products are calculated as 〈m a , m b |n a , n b 〉 = δ m a n a δ m b n b , (15) and hence the positive-definiteness of norm holds on. If we take a † |0, 0〉 = 0 in place of a|0, 0〉 = 0, a|0, 0〉 has a negative norm as seen from the relation,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>1 = 〈0, 0|0, 0〉 = 〈0, 0|[a, a † ]|0, 0〉 = −〈0, 0|a † a|0, 0〉 = −|a|0, 0〉| 2 . (16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The same is true of b and b † . L q is invariant under the U (1) transformation, δq = i [ǫN q , q] = i ǫq , δq † = i [ǫN q , q † ] = −i ǫq † , (17) where ǫ is an infinitesimal real number and N q is the conserved U (1) charge defined by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ǫN q ≡ 1 ħ ∂L q ∂ ˙ q R δq + δq † ∂L q ∂ ˙ q † L . (18) Note that N q is hermitian by definition, using (155) with L † q = L q . From (18), N q is given by N q = i ħ pq − q † p † = −a † a + bb † = −a † a + b † b + 1 , (19) where we use [b, b † ]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>= 1 to derive the last expression.</p>

				<p>Here, we give a comment on a consequence of a difference between ours (H q , N q ) and the following ordinary ones defined by only the right-differentiation,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>H 0 = p ˙ q + p † ˙ q † − L q = 1 m p † p + mω 2 q † q , N 0 = i ħ pq − p † q † . (20)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that N 0 turns out to be hermitian by using the commutation relations (7),</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>N † 0 = − i ħ q † p † − q p = − i ħ p † q † − pq = N 0 . (21) Using (4) and (5), H 0 and N 0 are rewritten by H 0 = 1 2 ħω a † a + aa † + b † b + bb † = ħω a † a + b † b + 1 , (22) N 0 = 1 2 −a † a − aa † + b † b + bb † = −a † a + b † b , (23) where we use [a, b]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>= 0 and [a † , b † ] = 0 to derive the second expressions and [a, a † ] = 1 and [b, b † ] = 1 to derive the last expressions. In case that variables are bosonic or follow the commutation relations, H 0 agrees with H q because of p † p = pp † and we obtain the same result. If we replace [a, a † ] = 1 and [b, b † ] = 1 with the anti-commutation relations aa † + a † a = 1 and bb † + b † b = 1, we arrive at a misleading result that H 0 are N 0 are some constants from the second expressions in (22) and (23). We will find that the treatment is not proper with careful consideration.</p>

				<p>Next, we study the system described by the Lagrangian,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L ξ = m ˙ ξ † ˙ ξ − mω 2 ξ † ξ , (24) where ξ = ξ(t ) is a fermionic coordinate taking Grassmann numbers and L † ξ = L ξ . The Euler-Lagrange equations for ξ and ξ † are given by m d 2 ξ † d t 2 = −mω 2 ξ † , m d 2 ξ d t 2 = −mω 2 ξ , (25)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>respectively. They also describe two harmonic oscillators with the same mass.</p>

				<p>According to Appendix A, let us define the canonical conjugate momenta of ξ and ξ † as ρ ≡ ∂L ξ ∂ ˙ ξ R = m ˙ ξ † , ρ † ≡ ∂L ξ ∂ ˙ ξ † L = m ˙ ξ , (26) respectively. By solving (25) and (26), we obtain the solutions</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ξ(t ) = ħ 2mω ce −i ωt + d † e i ωt , ξ † (t ) = ħ 2mω c † e i ωt + d e −i ωt , (27) ρ(t ) = i ħmω 2 c † e i ωt − d e −i ωt , ρ † (t ) = −i ħmω 2 ce −i ωt − d † e i ωt , (28) where c, d † , c † and d are Grassmann numbers. Using (26), the Hamiltonian is obtained as H ξ = ρ ˙ ξ + ˙ ξ † ρ † − L ξ = 1 m ρρ † + mω 2 ξ † ξ . (29)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Let us quantize the system by regarding variables as operators and imposing the</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>lowing anti-commutation relations on (ξ, ρ) and (ξ † , ρ † ), {ξ(t ), ρ(t )} = i ħ , {ξ † (t ), ρ † (t )} = −i ħ , {ξ(t ), ξ(t )} = 0 , {ρ(t ), ρ(t )} = 0 , {ξ † (t ), ξ † (t )} = 0 , {ρ † (t ), ρ † (t )} = 0 , {ξ(t ), ξ † (t )} = 0 , {ρ(t ), ρ † (t )} = 0 , {ξ(t ), ρ † (t )} = 0 , {ξ † (t ), ρ(t )} = 0 , (30) where {A, B} = AB + B A. Note that (30) are compatible with the classical counterparts (163) and (169). Or equivalently, for operators c, d † , c † and d , the following relations are imposed on, {c, c † } = 1 , {d , d † } = −1 , {c, c} = 0 , {c † , c † } = 0 , {d , d } = 0 , {d † , d † } = 0 , {c, d } = 0 , {c † , d † } = 0 , {c, d † } = 0 , {c † , d } = 0 . (31) From (29), (30) and (9), the following equations are derived d ξ d t = i ħ [H ξ , ξ] = ρ † m , d ξ † d t = i ħ [H ξ , ξ † ] = ρ m , (32) d ρ d t = i ħ [H ξ , ρ] = −mω 2 ξ † , d ρ † d t = i ħ [H ξ , ρ † ] = −mω 2 ξ , (33) where we use the relation, [AB,C ] = A{B,C } − {A,C }B . (34) (32) and (33) are equivalent to (25) and (26). By inserting (27) and (28) into (29), H ξ is written by H ξ = ħω c † c + d d † = ħω c † c − d † d − 1 , (35) where we use {d , d † } = −1 to derive the last expression. There are four eigenstates with the following eigenvalues for H ξ |0, 0〉 ; E = −ħω , |1, 0〉 = c † |0, 0〉 , |0, 1〉 = d † |0, 0〉 ; E = 0 , |1, 1〉 = c † d † |0, 0〉 ; E = ħω , (36) where |0, 0〉 is the ground state that satisfies c|0, 0〉 = 0 and d |0, 0〉 = 0. From the relation, 1 = 〈0, 0|0, 0〉 = −〈0, 0|{d , d † }|0, 0〉 = −〈0, 0|d d † |0, 0〉 = −|d † |0, 0〉| 2 , (37)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>we find that the state d † |0, 0〉 has a negative norm, and then the probability interpretation does not hold on. Hence, it is difficult to construct a quantum theory for fermionic harmonic oscillators alone.</p>

				<p>Even if we take another state |0, 0〉 as the ground state that satisfies c |0, 0〉 = 0 and d † |0, 0〉 = 0, the appearance of the negative norm states is inevitable from the relation,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>1 = 〈0, 0| 0, 0〉 = − 〈0, 0|{d , d † } |0, 0〉 = − 〈0, 0|d † d |0, 0〉 = −|d |0, 0〉| 2 , (38)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In this case, the energy spectrum is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>d |0, 0〉 ; E = −ħω , |0, 0〉 , c † d |0, 0〉 ; E = 0 , c † |0, 0〉 ; E = ħω , (39) L ξ is invariant under the U (1) transformation, δξ = i [ǫN ξ , ξ] = i ǫξ , δξ † = i [ǫN ξ , ξ † ] = −i ǫξ † , (40) where N ξ is the conserved U (1) charge defined by ǫN ξ ≡ 1 ħ ∂L ξ ∂ ˙ ξ R δξ + δξ † ∂L ξ ∂ ˙ ξ † L . (41) From (41), N ξ is given by N ξ = i ħ ρξ − ξ † ρ † = −c † c + d d † = −c † c − d † d − 1 , (42)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where we use {d , d † } = −1 to derive the last expression.</p>

				<p>We find that both H ξ and N ξ are hermitian by definition and are not constants, but the system is abnormal because it contains a state with a negative norm. We point out that the same conclusion is obtained even if we adopt the ordinary convention that the canonical momenta are defined by only the right differentiation.</p>

				<head n="2.3">Coexisting system of harmonic oscillators</head>

				<p>Next, let us consider the system that (q,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>q † ) and (ξ, ξ † ) coexist, whose Lagrangian is given by L q,ξ = m ˙ q † ˙ q − mω 2 q † q + m ˙ ξ † ˙ ξ − mω 2 ξ † ξ . (43) From (13) and (35), the Hamiltonian is obtained as H q,ξ = ħω a † a + b † b + c † c − d † d . (44)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that the sum of the zero-point energies vanishes due to the cancellation between contributions from (q, q † ) and (ξ, ξ † ).</p>

				<p>There are four kinds of eigenstates with the following eigenvalues for H q,ξ ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>|n a , n b , 0, 0〉 ≡ (a † ) n a n a ! (b † ) n b n b ! |0, 0, 0, 0〉 ; E = ħω(n a + n b ) , (45) |n a , n b , 1, 0〉 ≡ c † (a † ) n a n a !

				<p>As seen from (37), |n a , n b , 0, 1〉 and |n a , n b , 1, 1〉 have a negative norm, and the theory appears to be inconsistent. We will show that the system has fermionic symmetries and they save it from the disaster.</p>

				<p>The L q,ξ is invariant under the fermionic transformations,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>δ F q = −ζξ , δ F q † = 0 , δ F ξ = 0 , δ F ξ † = ζq † (49) and δ † F q = 0 , δ † F q † = ζ † ξ † , δ † F ξ = ζ † q , δ † F ξ † = 0 , (50)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where ζ and ζ † are Grassmann numbers. Note that δ F is not generated by a hermitian operator, different from the generator of the BRST transformation in systems with first class constraints [14] and that of the topological symmetry [15, 16].</p>

				<p>From the above transformation properties, we see that δ F and δ</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>† F are nilpotent, i.e., δ 2 F = 0 and δ †2 F = 0, or Q F 2 = 0 and Q † F 2 = 0 , (51) where the bold ones δ F and δ † F are defined by δ F = ζδ F and δ † F = ζ † δ † F , respectively. Q F and Q † F are the corresponding generators given by δ F O = i [ζQ F ,O] , δ † F O = i [Q † F ζ † ,O] , (52) and defined by ζQ F ≡ 1 ħ ∂L q,ξ ∂ ˙ q R δ F q + δ F ξ † ∂L q,ξ ∂ ˙ ξ † L , Q † F ζ † ≡ 1 ħ δ † F q † ∂L q,ξ ∂ ˙ q † L + ∂L q,ξ ∂ ˙ ξ R δ † F ξ . (53) Furthermore, we find the algebraic relation, {Q F ,Q † F } = N D , (54) where N D is the number operator defined by N D ≡ −N q − N ξ = a † a − b † b + c † c + d † d . (55)</trash>

					<figDesc>N q and N ξ are generators for U (1) transformations of q and ξ, defined by (19) and (42), respectively. The symmetry of our system is equivalent to OSp(2|2).</figDesc>
					<trash>From (53), the conserved fermionic charges Q F and Q † F are given by Q F = 1 ħ −pξ + q † ρ † , Q † F = 1 ħ −ξ † p † + ρq . (56) Then, the canonical momenta are transformed as, δ F p = 0 , δ F p † = −ζρ † , δ F ρ = ζp , δ F ρ † = 0 (57) and δ † F p = ζ † ρ , δ † F p † = 0 , δ † F ρ = 0 , δ † F ρ † = −ζ † p † . (58)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>It is easily understood that L q,ξ is invariant under the transformations (49) and (50), from the nilpotency of δ F and δ † F and the relations,</p>

					<trash>L q,ξ = δ F R q,ξ = δ † F R † q,ξ = δ F δ † F L q = −δ † F δ F L q , (59) where R q,ξ and R † q,ξ are given by R q,ξ = m ˙ ξ † ˙ q − mω 2 ξ † q , R † q,ξ = m ˙ q † ˙ ξ − mω 2 q † ξ . (60) The Hamiltonian H q,ξ is written in the Q F and Q † F exact forms such that H q,ξ = i Q F , ˜ R q,ξ = −i Q † F , ˜ R † q,ξ = Q F , Q † F , H q = − Q † F , Q F , H q , (61) where R q,ξ and R † q,ξ are given by ˜ R q,ξ = 1 m ρp † + mω 2 ξ † q , ˜ R † q,ξ = 1 m pρ † + mω 2 q † ξ . (62) Using the solutions (4), (5), (27), and (28), Q F and Q † F are written by Q F = −i (a † c − d † b) , Q † F = i (c † a − b † d ) . (63) Then, the operators are transformed as, δ F a = −ζc , δ F a † = 0 , δ F b † = −d † , δ F c = 0 , δ F c † = ζa † , δ F d = ζb , δ F d † = 0 (64) and δ † F a = 0 , δ † F a † = ζ † c † , δ † F b = ζ † d , δ † F b † = 0 , δ † F c = ζ † a , δ † F c † = 0 , δ † F d = 0 , δ † F d † = ζ † b † .

					<trash>Q F |phys〉 = 0 , Q † F |phys〉 = 0 , N D |phys〉 = 0 (66) or ˜ Q 1 |phys〉 = 0 , ˜ Q 2 |phys〉 = 0 , N D |phys〉 = 0 , (67) where Q 1 and Q 2 are hermitian fermionic charges defined by ˜ Q 1 ≡ Q F +Q † F , ˜ Q 2 ≡ i (Q F −Q † F ) . (68) Then, the following relations are derived, 〈phys|δ F O|phys〉 = 〈phys|i [ζQ F ,O]|phys〉 = 0 , (69) 〈phys|δ † F O|phys〉 = 〈phys|i [Q † F ζ † ,O]|phys〉 = 0 . (70) Using (69) and (70), we obtain the following relations from (64) and (65): 〈phys|a|phys〉 = 0 , 〈phys|a † |phys〉 = 0 , (71) 〈phys|b|phys〉 = 0 , 〈phys|b † |phys〉 = 0 , (72) 〈phys|c|phys〉 = 0 , 〈phys|c † |phys〉 = 0 , (73) 〈phys|d |phys〉 = 0 , 〈phys|d † |phys〉 = 0 . (74)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The conditions (66) are interpreted as counterparts of the Kugo-Ojima subsidiary condition in the BRST quantization [17, 18]. We find that all states given by |n a , n b , n c , n d 〉, except for the ground state |0, 0, 0, 0〉, are unphysical because they do not satisfy (66). Or it is interpreted as the quartet mechanism [17, 18]. The projection operator P (n) on the states with n = n a + n b + n c + n d is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>P (n) = 1 n a † P (n−1) a + b † P (n−1) b +c † P (n−1) c − d † P (n−1) d (n ≥ 1) , (75) and is written by P (n) = i Q F , R (n) , (76) where R (n) is given by R (n) = 1 n c † P (n−1) a + b † P (n−1) d (n ≥ 1) . (77)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We find that any state with n ≥ 1 is unphysical from the relation 〈phys|P (n) |phys〉 = 0 for n ≥ 1, i.e., only the ground state |0, 0, 0, 0〉 is physical. This is also regarded as a quantum mechanical version of the Parisi-Sourlas mechanism [19]. The point is that the system has negative norm states, but they become unphysical and harmless.</p>

				<p>The remedy of the system described by L ξ is not unique. There is a possibility that the real and the imaginary part of ξ are regarded as the Faddeev-Popov ghost variable c(t ) and the anti-ghost one c(t ), respectively.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Using ξ(t ) = (c(t ) + i c(t ))/ 2, L ξ is rewritten by L ξ = m ˙ ξ † ˙ ξ − mω 2 ξ † ξ = −i m ˙ c ˙ c + i mω 2 cc . (78) We introduce those BRST partners r (t ) and B(t ) with the BRST transformation, δ B r = −c , δ B c = 0 , δ B c = i B , δ B B = 0 , (79) and construct the Lagrangian, L r,c = −i δ B ˙ c ˙ r − mω 2 cr = m ˙ B ˙ r − mω 2 Br − i m ˙ c ˙ c + i mω 2 cc . (80) Using the change of variables r (t ) = (x(t ) + y(t ))/ 2 and B(t ) = (x(t ) − y(t ))/ 2, the part containing r (t ) and B(t ) is rewritten as L x,y = m ˙ x 2 − mω 2 x 2 − m ˙ y 2 + mω 2 y 2 , (81)</trash>

				<p>and then we find that x(t ) has a positive norm and y(t ) has a negative norm. Based on the BRST quantization, we understand that the system is also empty leaving the vacuum state alone.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, we give comments on similarities and differences between supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics[20] and our model. The ingredients of SUSY quantum mechanics are two hermitian fermionic charges Q i (</p>

In our model, ˜ Q 1 and Q 2 satisfy Q 1 ˜ Q 2 + ˜ Q 2 ˜ Q 1 = 0 and N D = ˜ Q 2 1 = ˜ Q 2 2 . Here N D is the number operator of the Q F doublet. Note that the algebraic relations among ( ˜ Q 1 , ˜ Q 2 , N D ) are same as (Q 1 ,Q 2 , H) in N = 2 SUSY, but N D is different from our Hamiltonian H q,ξ . Our model is also formulated, using Q 1 and Q 2 . Concretely, L q,ξ and H q,ξ are written as L q,ξ = δ 1 R (1) q,ξ = δ 2 R (2) q,ξ , H q,ξ = i ˜ Q 1 , ˜ R (1) q,ξ = i ˜ Q 2 , ˜ R (2) q,ξ , (82) where δ 1 and δ 2 are defined by θδ 1 O = i [θ ˜ Q 1 ,O] = i [θ(Q F +Q † F ),O] and θδ 2 O = i [θ ˜ Q 2 ,O] = i [θi (Q F −Q † F ),O] with a Grassmann parameter satisfying θ † = −θ. R (i ) q,ξ and R (i ) q,ξ are given by R (1) q,ξ = 1 2 (R q,ξ − R † q,ξ ) , R (2) q,ξ = 1 2i (R q,ξ + R † q,ξ ) , (83) ˜ R (1) q,ξ = 1 2 ( ˜ R q,ξ − ˜ R † q,ξ ) , ˜ R (2) q,ξ = 1 2i ( ˜ R q,ξ + ˜ R † q,ξ ) . (84) They are anti-hermitian, i.e., R (i ) † q,ξ = −R (i ) q,ξ and R (i ) † q,ξ = − ˜ R (i ) q,ξ , and are invariant under the transformation generated by N D , i. e., δ D R (i ) q,ξ = 0 and [N D , ˜ R (i ) q,ξ ] = 0. ˜ R (1) q,ξ and R (2) q,ξ satisfy the relations R (1)2 q,ξ = ˜ R (2)2 q,ξ = −(ħω) 2 N D /4 and R (1) q,ξ ˜ R (2) q,ξ + ˜ R (2) q,ξ ˜ R (1) q,ξ = 0, and H q,ξ is commutable tõ Q i , ˜ R (i ) q,ξ and N D .</trash>

				<p>Every state has a positive norm in SUSY quantum mechanics and H is positive semidefinite by definition. In contrast, some states have a negative norm in our model and hence H q,ξ is positive semi-definite despite its appearance.</p>

				<head n="4">Conclusions</head>

				<p>We have reexamined the connection between spin and statistics through the quantization of a complex scalar field. Starting from an ordinary Lagrangian density and imposing the anti-commutation relations on the scalar field, we have found that the difficulty stems from not the ill-definiteness (or unboundedness) of the energy and the violation of the causality but the appearance of states with negative norms. 2,3 These features also hold for the system with a spinor field imposing the commutation relations on. As a by-product, we have constructed analytical mechanics in the form with the manifestly hermitian property.</p>

				<p>The fermionic scalar field (or a bosonic spinor field) cannot exist alone, because the probability of its discovery is negative and physically meaningless. We have proposed that the system with a fermionic scalar field (or a bosonic spinor field) becomes harmless by introducing an ordinary complex scalar field (or an ordinary spinor field) to form a doublet of fermionic symmetries, although the system becomes empty leaving the vacuum state alone. It is meaningful to construct an interacting model containing our coexisting system as a subsystem, after the example of the gauge fixing term and the Faddeev- Popov ghost term in gauge theories.</p>

				<p>Here, the following question arises from the physical point of view. Even if there were a coexisting system with only unphysical modes, is it physically meaningful or is it verified? It is deeply connected to the question &quot; what is the physical reality? &quot; There is a possibility that unphysical particles leave behind a fingerprint relating symmetries based on the scenario that our world comes into existence from unphysical world, even if they did not give any dynamical effects on the physical sector at the beginning [25]. It would be interesting to explore the physics concerning the reversal connection of spin and statistics and the application to its phenomenology, based on the above scenario.</p>

				<p>The author thanks Prof. T. Kugo for valuable discussions and useful comments. This work was supported in part by scientific grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology under Grant Nos. 22540272 and 21244036. 2 Recently, higher spin fields with abnormal commutation relations are studied and the same features are obtained using explicit models in [23]. The models are different from ours in the following point. The models in [23] are constructed from a pair of complex fields such as a pair of fermionic scalar fields or a pair of bosonic spinor fields and their Lagrangian density is composed of the mixing terms of the pair. In contrast, our model is constructed from a single fermionic scalar field or a single bosonic spinor field and the Lagrangian density has the same form as that of an ordinary complex scalar field or an ordinary Dirac spinor field. If combined with our results, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that the positive norm condition is crucial to the spin-statistics theorem in a wide class of models. 3 In [24], the connection of spin and statistics are examined for massless fields in any number of spacetime dimensions, and it is concluded that hermitian fields obeying abnormal relations like the Faddeev- Popov ghost fields do not violate the microscopic causality, either.</p>
