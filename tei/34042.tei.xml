				<p>Microscopic black holes are sensitive to higher dimension operators in the gravi-tational action. We compute the influence of these operators on the Schwarzschild solution using perturbation theory. All (time reversal invariant) operators of dimension six are included (dimension four operators don&apos;t alter the Schwarzschild solution). Corrections to the relation between the Hawking temperature and the black hole mass are found. The entropy is calculated using the Gibbons-Hawking prescription for the Euclidean path integral and using naive thermodynamic reasoning. These two methods agree, however, the entropy is not equal to 1/4 the area of the horizon.</p>

				<p>Classical black hole solutions to generalizations of Einsteins gravitational action S 0 = 1 16πG d 4 x √ gR , (1) have been found in several different cases. Particularly noteworthy is the work of</p>

				<p>Callan, Myers and Perry and Myers who (motivated by string theory) examined black holes in a model with a dilaton field and terms quadratic and quartic in the curvature tensor. [1] Our methods and conclusions are similar to those in Ref. [1]. The main differences are that we consider pure gravity (i.e., no dilaton field) and allow arbitrary coefficients for the higher powers of the curvature tensor instead of the particular combinations implied by string theory. In this paper we use perturbation theory to find the corrections to the Schwarzschild solution that arise from including higher powers of the curvature tensor in the gravitational action. All possible time reversal invariant terms of dimension four and dimension six are included, although only a few of the dimension six operators actually influence the solution. Such terms are expected to occur, for example, from integrating out massive degrees of freedom. Their influence on macroscopic black holes is negligible but they may play a role in the physics of microscopic black holes in the final stages of the evaporation process. [2,3] In general the gravitational action can be written as [4] S = S 0 + S 1 + S 2 + ... (2) where S i denotes the contribution of operators of dimension 2i + 2 (S 0 is given by eq. (1)). The spacetime metric generated by any static spherically symmetric matter distribution can be cast in the form [5]</p>

				<p>and has b = 2GM and φ = 0, where M is the black hole mass. We are interested in corrections to this that arise from the S i , i = 1, 2, ... . In fact the contribution of operators of dimension four to the gravitational action, S 1 , does not alter this solution. The most general (time reversal invariant) form for S 1 is</p>

					<figDesc>The function b(r) and φ(r) are determined by integrating eqs. (12) with the boundary conditions b(∞) = 2GM and φ(∞) = 0. The horizon is located at a radius r H that satisfies b(r H ) = r H . The relationship between the radius of the horizon and the black hole mass is</figDesc>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The Euclidean section of the geometry (3) has R 2 × S 2 topology. The imaginary time coordinate plays the role of the polar angle in R 2 and the origin of this plane is at the horizon. The period of the imaginary time coordinate is the inverse of the Hawking temperature T . Expanding the metric (3) in the vicinity of the horizon gives [5]</figDesc>
					<trash>T = 1 4πr H e −φ(rH) (1 − b ′ (r H )) . (14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Using this and our results for b and φ we find that when the terms in S 2 are included the relationship between the Hawking temperature and mass becomes</figDesc>
					<trash>T = 1 8πGM 1 + π G 3 M 4 2c 1 − 1 2 c 2 . (15)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that c 3 and c 4 do not affect the relationship between the Hawking temperature and the mass of the black hole. The terms proportional to c 3 and c 4 in the action S 2 can be removed by a field redefinition of the metric. For example, the redefinition g µν → g µν (1 − 16πGc 4 R αβλσ R αβλσ ) , (16) removes the term proportional to c 4 in S 2 from the gravitational action. Of course such a redefinition of the metric also effects the equation of motion of test particles.</p>

				<p>If test particles, moving under the influence of gravity, travel along geodesics then after the field redefinition in eq. (16) the equation of motion becomes</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>d 2 x ν ds 2 + Γ ν αβ dx α ds dx β ds + 8πGc 4 (R αβλσ R αβλσ ) ;ν −8πGc 4 (R αβγδ R αβγδ ) ;λ dx λ ds dx ν ds = 0 . (17)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The temperature and mass of the black hole can be measured at infinity and don&apos;t depend on test particles equation of motion. Consequently the temperature mass relation is independent of c 3 and c 4 . However, to measure the radius of the horizon a test particle must travel near the black hole horizon where corrections to the equation of motion (like that in eq. (17)) cannot be neglected. That is why c 3 and c 4 influence the relationship between the radius of the horizon and the mass of the black hole.</p>

				<p>We expect that typically higher dimension operators (involving the curvature tensor) in the action for matter fields will induce changes in the equation of motion of the corresponding test particles like that in eq. (17). Furthermore, these changes will, in general, be different for different types of test particles so that a single redefinition of the metric will not make all test particles travel along geodesics. In this case the value of the radius of the horizon depends on which type of test particle is performing the measurement. (For related reasons such higher dimension operators cause the flux of Hawking radiation from a black hole to depend on the type of particle being radiated.) Applying the thermodynamic [8] identity dE = T dS with E equal to the mass of the black hole and T the Hawking temperature gives</p>

				<p>where eq. (15) was used for T . The entropy S can also be calculated from the Euclidean path integral using the method of Gibbons and Hawking. [9] The terms proportional to c 1 and c 2 in S 2 contribute to the Euclidean action and thus to the free energy divided by the temperature. The Euclidean geometry corresponds to the analytic continuation of the part of the Lorentzian geometry outside the horizon.</p>

					<figDesc>the contribution of the terms in S 2 to the free energy divided by the temperature is</figDesc>
					<trash>S (Euclidean) 2 = −(8πGM)4π 12c 1 − 3c 2 6 1 (2GM) 3 = − 4π 2 G 2 M 2 2c 1 − 1 2 c 2 . (19) The equation of motion G µν = 8πGT µν 2 , with the explicit form for T µν 2 in eq. (11), implies</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>(when the indices are contracted with the metric g µν ) that the contribution of S 0 to the free energy divided by the temperature is the same as S 2 . Finally the surface term involving the extrinsic curvature gives the usual contribution, M/2T , to the free energy divided by the temperature. [10] Putting these results together yields the entropy,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S = M T − F T = M 2T − 2S (Euclidean) 2 = 4πGM 2 + 4π 2 G 2 M 2 (2c 1 − 1 2 c 2 ) . (20)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Differentiating this with respect to the black hole mass we see that the calculation of the entropy using the Euclidean path integral method of Gibbons and Hawking agrees with the naive thermodynamic relation in eq. (18). If a term proportional to R αβλσ R αβλσ was added to S 1 it would also contribute to the Euclidean action and hence to the entropy. However, this is consistent with the thermodynamic relation in eq. (18) since such a contribution of S 1 to the entropy is a constant independent of M. The agreement between eqs. (20) and (18) provides further evidence that in the semiclassical approximation the prescription of Gibbons and Hawking for the Euclidean path integral correctly gives the free energy of the black hole.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Euclidean path integral and thermodynamic calculations of the entropy agree, however, the entropy is not equal to πr 2 H /G (i.e., one quarter the area of the horizon in appropriate units). Since one-loop Feynman diagrams can generate operators like those in S 2 we expect that even if the gravitational action were given by S 0 quantum corrections of order ¯ h would cause a deviation from the relation S = πr 2 H /G. (Quantum corrections to the entropy area relation of order e −κ/¯ h have previously been considered [11,12]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>.)</p>

				<p>The major conclusions of this paper, that the Euclidean path integral correctly gives the free energy and that the entropy is not 1/4 the area of the horizon, have already been observed in Ref. [1] for the case of gravity coupled to a dilaton field and the particular higher powers of the curvature tensor implied by string theory. (Similar conclusions have also been made for Lovelock gravity [13] .) Our results demonstrate these conclusions in the slightly different case of pure gravity (i.e., no dilaton) in four spacetime dimensions with generic higher dimension operators.</p>
