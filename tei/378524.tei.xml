				<head>I INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>One of the most interesting future directions in nuclear physics may be to study how nuclear matter properties change as the environment changes. Forthcoming ultra-relativistic heavy-ion experiments are expected to give significant information on the strong interaction (i.e., QCD ) in matter, through the detection of changes in hadronic properties [1, 2, 3]. In particular, the variations in hadron masses in the nuclear medium have attracted wide interest because such changes could be a signal of the formation of hot hadronic and/or quark-gluon matter in the energetic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Several authors have recently studied the vector-meson (ω, ρ, φ) masses using the vector dominance model [4], QCD sum rules [5] and the Walecka model (QHD) [6, 7, 8], and have reported that the mass decreases in the nuclear medium. There is also a proposal to look for such mass shifts at CEBAF [9].</p>

				<p>In the approach based on QCD sum rules, the reduction of the mass is mainly due to the four-quark condensates and one of the twist-2 condensates, ¯ qγ µ D µ q. However, it has been suggested that there may be considerable, intrinsic uncertainty in the standard assumptions underlying the QCD sum-rule analyses [10]. On the other hand, in hadronic models like QHD [11], the main reason for the reduction in masses is the polarization of the Dirac sea [6, 7, 8], where the antinucleons in matter play a crucial role. However, from the point of view of the quark model, the strong excitation of nucleon-antinucleon pairs in medium is difficult to understand. It is clear that these two mechanisms are quite different.</p>

				<p>Several years ago Guichon [12] proposed an entirely different model for nuclear matter , based on a mean-field description in which quarks (in nucleon bags) interact selfconsistently with σ and ω mesons. The model has been refined by Fleck et al. [13] and the present authors. It provides a natural explanation of nuclear saturation and the right magnitude of the nuclear compressibility. We have used this model to investigate the nuclear structure functions [14], the properties of both nuclear and neutron matter [15] and the Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly and isospin symmetry breaking in matter [16].</p>

				<p>We argued that the response of the internal structure of the nucleon to its environment is vital to the understanding of, not only physics with momentum transfers of several GeV (eg., deep-inelastic scattering), but also physics at scale of a few MeV (eg., a violation of charge symmetry in nuclear medium). In Ref.[15], the relationship between the Guichon model (alias the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model in our papers) and QHD has also been clarified. Even though this model is extremely simple, the insights gained from it may help to reveal the essential physics [17]. Here we use the Guichon model to investigate variations of various hadronic properties, as well as the density dependence of the quark condensate in nuclear matter, as functions of the nuclear density up to four times normal nuclear density.</p>

				<p>This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the QMC model is introduced and applied to calculate the modification of the properties of the nucleon in nuclear matter.</p>

				<p>The masses of the vector mesons (ω, ρ) and the hyperons (Λ, Σ, Ξ) in matter are studied in Sec. III. We find that the change in the hadron masses can be described in terms of scalar mean-field values in medium. Some relationships among the hadron masses are given. Next, in Sec. IV, we use this model to study the density dependence of the quark condensate, which may be linked to a diverse range of nuclear phenomena. The density dependence of the quark condensate can be well fitted by a linear function of the nuclear density. Then, some connections among the hadron properties and the quark condensate in medium are discussed.</p>

				<p>The QMC model treats nuclear matter as a collection of (nucleon) MIT bags, selfconsistently bound by the exchange of scalar (σ) and vector (ω, ρ) mesons. We assume that nuclear matter with N = Z is uniformly distributed, and that the mesons can be treated in mean-field approximation (MFA). Let the mean-field values for the σ, ω (the time component) and ρ (the time component in the third direction of isospin) fields be ¯ σ, ¯ ω and ¯ b, respectively. The quarks in a static spherical bag interact with those mean fields. The Dirac equation for a quark field, ψ q , in a bag is then given by [iγ ·</p>

				<p>this model it is hard to deal with the density dependence of the σ meson in medium because it couples strongly to the pseudoscalar (π) channel, which requires a direct treatment of chiral symmetry in medium [19].

[6]), we shall keep the free value, 550 MeV, even in medium.</p>

				<p>In Fig.3 the density dependence of the axial-vector coupling constant of the nucleon is illustrated. It decreases as the density increases. On the other hand, the magnetic moment of the proton in symmetric nuclear matter increases with density as shown in Fig.4. The calculation of these quantities is standard [21] (c.m. and recoil corrections are not included [22]). It is rather easy to understand why g ⋆ A and µ ⋆ N tend to decrease and increase, respectively, with density: in the bag model these quantities involve integrals over the upper and lower components of the quark wave function. Because the attractive scalar potential effectively decreases the quark mass it makes the solution more relativistic – i.e., the lower component of the wave function is enhanced. This fact leads, respectively, to the decrease and increase of g ⋆ A and µ ⋆ N in medium. Given the simplicity of this argument we find the conclusion that the magnetic moments of the other hadrons should increase quite compelling.</p>

Furthermore, we have calculated the charge radius of the proton in medium, and we find that the change is within a few per cent even at ρ B ∼ 4ρ 0 . Here we must add a caution that the contribution of meson exchange currents (MEC) to g ⋆ A , µ ⋆ N , etc. would be considerable in medium, and, hence, we should treat the whole problem including MEC to get the final results for the changes in these quantites. This is obviously beyond the scope of the present work.</figDesc>

				<p>Now we are in a position to present our main results. In Fig.5, the ratio of the effective</p>

				</figure>

				<p>vector-meson mass, m ⋆ v , to that in free space is shown as a function of the density. Since the difference between the effective ω-and ρ-meson masses at the same density is very small, we show only one curve for both mesons in the figure. As the density increases the vector-meson mass decreases (as several authors have previously noticed [4, 5, 6, 8]), and seems to become flat like the effective nucleon mass. The mass reduction can be well expressed by a linear form at small density:</p>

				<p><formula>m ⋆ v m v ≃ 1 − 0.09 ρ B ρ 0 . (18)</formula></p>

				<p>The reduction factor, 0.09, is somewhat smaller than that predicted by the QCD sum rules [8]. In this model the reduction in the mass is basically caused by the attractive scalar mean-field in medium, and this origin is clearly different from that in QHD [6, 8], in which the essential mechanism is the vacuum polarization due to the excitation of nucleon-antinucleon pairs in medium.</p>

				<p>It is possible to calculate masses of other hadrons in this model. In particular, there is considerable interest in studying the properties of hyperons in medium – eg. Λ, Σ and Ξ. For the hyperons themselves we again use the MIT bag model, including the c.m. corrections (see Eq.(8)). We assume that the strange quark does not couple to the σ meson in MFA, and that the addition of a single hyperon to nuclear matter of density ρ B does not alter the values of the scalar and vector mean-fields. The mass of the strange quark, m s , is determined so as to reproduce the mass splitting between the nucleon and the average of Λ and Σ hyperons, M Hav (= 1154 MeV), in free space. We then find m s = 355.5, 358.1, 354.0 MeV for R 0 = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 f m, respectively. Using these values of the strange-quark mass, we have calculated the average mass of Λ and Σ, M</p>

				<p>where the reduction factor is about half of those in Eqs.(18) and (19).</p>

				<p>We summarize the effective masses of the hadrons in medium in Fig.8. As one can see from the figure, the reduction in both the vector-meson mass and the average mass of Λ and Σ are about twice that in the Ξ-hyperon mass over a wide range of ρ B , while the reduction in the nucleon is about three times that in the Ξ. One can also see this fact from the reduction factors in Eq.(15) and Eqs.(18) ∼ (20). It is rather easy to understand Figure 8: The ratios of the effective masses of the hadrons in symmetric nuclear matter to those in free space (R 0 = 0.8 f m). The dashed, solid, dotted and dot-dashed curves are for Ξ, (Λ + Σ)/2, the vector (ω, ρ) meson and the nucleon, respectively. why such a relationship holds among the hadron masses: the nucleon consists of three non-strange quarks, which couple to the scalar mean-field in medium, while the vector mesons, and the Λ and Σ hyperons, involve just two non-strange quarks. The Ξ hyperon consists of only one non-strange quark and two strange quarks. Since the strange quark does not feel the scalar mean-field, its mass is not altered in medium. The change in the hadron mass is therefore roughly determined by the number of non-strange quarks, n 0 , and the strength of the scalar mean-field, V σ . We can then find an approximate form of the hadron mass in symmetric nuclear matter:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M ⋆ hadron M hadron ≃ 1 − const × n 0 V σ (MeV), (21) where const ≃ 3.2 × 10 −4 MeV −1 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that this formula is not too sensitive to the bag radius, and that it can reproduce the hadron masses reasonably well over the range of ρ B up to about 3ρ 0 . From Eq.(21) we expect the following relations among the hadron</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>masses: M ⋆ N M N ≈ M ⋆ Ξ M Ξ 3 , m ⋆ v m v ≈ M ⋆ Λ M Λ ≈ M ⋆ Σ M Σ ≈ M ⋆ Ξ M Ξ 2 . (22) Furthermore, using Eqs.(16) and (17), g ⋆ A , µ ⋆ N and m ⋆ v at small density could be linked as m ⋆ v m v ≈ g ⋆ A g A ≈ µ ⋆ N µ N −1 . (23)</trash>

				<head>IV QUARK CONDENSATES IN MEDIUM</head>

				<p>Having shown that the QMC model provides an interesting description of the hadron mass in nuclear matter we now apply it to study the behavior of the quark condensates in medium.

				<p>Fig.9 we show the ratio of the quark condensate in medium to that in vacuum. As one can see, the density dependence of the quark condensate can be well fitted by a linear function of the density :</p>

				<p>The value of 0.36 agrees with the model-independent prediction of Cohen et al. [24] for symmetric nuclear matter. Note that the ratio is not sensitive to the bag radius.

				<p>σ ≃ 260 and C N (0) ≃ 0.37, Eq.(33) can reproduce Eq.(32). On the other hand, since the ratio of the hadron mass in medium to that in free space is roughly described by Eq.(21), the ratio of the quark condensates could be linked to the ratio of the hadron masses at low density:</p>

				<head>V CONCLUSION</head>

				<p>We have applied the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model to investigate the density dependence of the properties of hadrons and the quark condensates in dense nuclear matter (up to four times the normal nuclear density). We have calculated not only the variations in the nucleon properties in medium but also those in the masses of the vector (ω, ρ) mesons and the hyperons (Λ, Σ, Ξ). As several authors have suggested [4, 5, 6, 8], the hadron mass is reduced due to the change of the scalar mean-field in medium. In the present model the hadron mass can be related to the number of non-strange quarks and the strength of the scalar mean-field. The hadron masses are simply connected to one another , and the relationship among them is given by Eq.(22), which is effective over a wide range of the nuclear density. Furthermore, the ratio of the quark condensate in medium to that in vacuum can be related to the vector-meson mass and the nucleon properties –</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>eg., g ⋆ A and µ ⋆ N – in medium.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Finally, we would like to give a few caveats concerning the present calculation. The basic idea of the model is that the mesons are locally coupled to the quarks. This is certainly common for pions in models like the chiral or cloudy bag [26], but may be less justified for heavier mesons like the vector mesons, which are obviously not collective states. The model also omits the effect of short-range correlations among the quarks. At very high density these would be expected to dominate. Furthermore, the pionic cloud of the hadron [26] should be considered explicitly in any truly quantitative study of the hadron properties in medium. As we mentioned at the end of Sec. II, the contribution of meson exchange currents in medium is also important and should be considered in a consistent manner. Finally, we note that subtleties such as scalar-vector mixing in medium and the splitting between longitudinal and transverse masses of the vector mesons [7] have been ignored in the present mean-field study. Although the former appears to be quite small in QHD the latter will certainly be important in any attempt to actually measure the mass shift.</p>
