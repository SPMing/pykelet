				<p>An intriguing new duality between planar MHV gluon amplitudes and light-like Wilson loops in N = 4 super Yang-Mills is investigated. We extend previous checks of the duality by performing a two-loop calculation of the rectangular and pentagonal Wilson loop. Furthermore , we derive an all-order broken conformal Ward identity for the Wilson loops and analyse its consequences. Starting from six points, the Ward identity allows for an arbitrary function of conformal invariants to appear in the expression for the Wilson loop. We compute this function at six points and two loops and discuss its implications for the corresponding gluon amplitude. It is found that the duality disagrees with a conjecture for the gluon amplitudes by Bern et al. A recent calculation by Bern et al indeed shows that the latter conjecture breaks down at six gluons and at two loops. By doing a numerical comparison with their results we find that the duality between gluon amplitudes and Wilson loops is preserved. This review is based on the author&apos;s PhD thesis and includes developments until May 2008.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>In the standard model of elementary particles, the strong interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is a non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory, with the quarks being in the fundamental representation of the gauge group SU(3). In contrast to quantum electrodynamics , the non-Abelian nature of the gauge group allows the gauge bosons to interact with each other. It is this property which leads to asymptotic freedom and the confinement of quarks. Despite the simplicity and elegance of the QCD Lagrangian, many open problems remain, such as understanding the transition from the high-energy region (short distances), where perturbation theory is valid, to the low-energy region (long distances) of confined quarks. &apos;t Hooft proposed to consider Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU (N ), for N very large, while keeping the &apos;t Hooft coupling g 2 N (with g being the Yang-Mills coupling constant) fixed [1]. In this way, one may hope to see simplifications for N large, and eventually get insight into QCD by computing terms in an 1/N expansion. The latter resembles that of the genus expansion of string theory. For N → ∞, non-planar diagrams are suppressed, which is why the &apos;t Hooft limit is also referred to as the planar limit. Hints that simplifications may occur in the &apos;t Hooft limit appeared in [2, 3], where integrable structures were found when studying high-energy scattering in gauge theory. Nevertheless, QCD in the &apos;t Hooft limit is still far from being solved. It seems natural to study supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, which are much simpler. In particular, the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, N = 4 SYM, has many special properties. It was shown long ago that its β function vanishes, and hence its coupling constant does not run. It is an interacting superconformal field theory, where the coupling constant is a free parameter. Moreover, through the AdS/CFT correspondence it is expected to be dual to type IIB superstring theory on AdS 5 × S 5 [4]. This is a realisation of &apos;t Hooft&apos;s idea of a gauge/string duality in the N → ∞ limit. The nature of this duality, which relates field theory at strong coupling with string theory at weak coupling, implies that the perturbative series of &apos;observables&apos; (such as e.g. correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators) in N = 4 SYM has to reproduce perturbative string theory results. In order for this to happen, one may suspect that the perturbative expansion of these quantities must have special properties. Indeed , remarkably simple structures have been observed in N = 4 SYM, mainly in two domains: firstly, anomalous dimensions of composite operators and secondly, on-shell n-particle scattering amplitudes.</p>

				<p>The AdS/CFT correspondence identifies string states with composite, gauge-invariant operators on the gauge theory side. In testing the correspondence, computing scaling dimensions of such operators in N = 4 SYM plays an important role. The first tests were done for &apos;protected&apos; operators, whose scaling dimension can be shown to be coupling independent. It therefore equals their classical (tree-level) dimension, which has to agree with the string theory prediction. For generic operators, the scaling dimension depends on the coupling constant, and a comparison with string theory is difficult because of the weak/strong nature of the duality, i.e. it would require summing the complete perturbation series.</p>

				<p>Important progress in computing anomalous dimensions in N = 4 SYM was made with the discovery of integrability in the planar (large N ) limit. In QCD, integrable structures at one loop were observed some time ago [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In certain cases, the dilatation operator, which measures the conformal dimension of a given operator, turns out to be described by an integrable spin chain. In N = 4 SYM, the integrability of the complete dilatation operator at one loop was found in [11, 12, 13, 14]. Most importantly, in some sectors it was shown to extend to higher loop levels [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. If this integrability persists to arbitrary loop levels, then one can hope to make contact with strong coupling results. Indeed, on the string theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the classical Green-Schwarz superstring action for AdS 5 × S 5 , constructed in [26], is integrable [27]. If the integrability survives quantisation [28, 29], it might be possible to identify the integrable structures on both sides of the correspondence.</p>

				<p>Integrability, or in certain cases the assumption of integrability, allowed the computation of the anomalous dimensions of various operators in N = 4 SYM. Spectacular progress was made by the all-order conjecture of Beisert, Eden and Staudacher [30] (see also [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]) for the asymptotic Bethe ansatz 2 describing the anomalous dimensions of composite operators in the SL(2) sector of N = 4 SYM. Their proposal leads to an integral equation (BES equation) for the cusp anomalous dimension [36, 37, 38], valid to all orders in the coupling constant. It correctly reproduces the known perturbative values of the cusp anomalous dimension [38, 16, 39, 40] and also agrees with results at strong coupling [41, 42, 43] (for the strong-coupling expansion of the BES equation see [44, 45, 46]).</p>

				<p>The second domain where unexpected simplicity was found is that of on-shell gluon scattering . Indeed, the scattering amplitudes turn out to be much simpler than one would expect on general grounds. Even at tree-level, the number of Feynman diagrams contributing to a given amplitude increases factorially with the number of external gluons. Nevertheless, some classes of tree-level amplitudes are known for an arbitrary number of legs. For example, the maximally helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes are given by very simple one-line expressions [47, 48], and all tree-level amplitudes satisfy recursion relations derived by Britto, Cachazo and Feng (and Witten) [49, 50]. Moreover, tree-level amplitudes have simple properties in twistor space [51].</p>

				<p>Furthermore, enormous progress has been achieved to compute loop level amplitudes, mainly using unitarity-based techniques [52, 53], which are inspired by the Cutkosky rules [54]. These have allowed the computation of a large class of one-loop amplitudes, and in the case of N = 4 SYM even some two-, three-, and four-loop amplitudes [55, 56, 39, 40]. Anastasiou, Bern, Dixon and Kosower (ABDK) noticed that the four-gluon amplitude at two loops has a remarkable iterative structure [56]. For the infrared divergent terms of the amplitude, such an iteration is expected on general grounds, but a similar iteration was found to hold also for the finite part.</p>

				<p>Following years of intensive studies of gluon scattering amplitudes [52, 55, 57] and based on the observation of ABDK, the conjecture was put forward by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov [39] that the maximally helicity-violating (MHV) planar gluon amplitudes in N = 4 SYM have a remarkably simple all-loop iterative structure. In general, these amplitudes have the following form:</p>

				<figure>

				</figure>

				<p>is the colour-ordered planar gluon amplitude, divided by the tree amplitude.</p>

				<p>The first term on the right-hand side describes the infrared (IR) divergences and the second term is the finite contribution dependent on the gluon momenta p i and on the &apos;t Hooft coupling a = g 2 N /(8π 2 ). The structure of IR divergences is well understood in any gauge theory [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]. In particular, in theories with a vanishing β function like N = 4 SYM, the leading IR singularity in dimensional regularisation is a double pole, whose coefficient is the universal cusp anomalous dimension appearing in many physical processes [38, 74, 75, 16]. Interestingly, the latter is also predicted by integrable models, as mentioned above. The BDS conjecture provides an explicit expression for the finite part, F</p>

				<p>, for an arbitrary number n of external gluons, to all orders in the coupling a. Remarkably, the dependence of F loop. At present, the BDS conjecture has been tested up to three loops for n = 4 [39] and up to two loops for n = 5 [76]. The results of this thesis are relevant for the case n = 6 at two loops.</p>

				<p>The aforementioned scattering amplitudes in N = 4 have even more interesting features. Drummond, Sokatchev, Smirnov, and the present author found that all integrals appearing in the four-gluon amplitude up to three loops are of a special type [77]. In dual momentum variables defined by p i = x i+1 − x i , (2) all integrals can be seen to have broken conformal properties. This is unexpected since this broken dual conformal symmetry is not, at least not in an obvious way, a consequence of the usual (super-)conformal symmetry of N = 4 SYM. This surprising observation was confirmed at four loops [40] and was used as an assumption for constructing the four-gluon amplitude at five loops [78].</p>

				<p>In an important recent development in the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, Alday and Maldacena proposed [79] the strong coupling description of planar gluon scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM and were able to make a direct comparison with the BDS prediction based on weak coupling results for the same amplitudes. According to their proposal, certain planar gluon amplitudes at strong coupling are related to the area of a minimal surface in AdS 5 space attached to a specific closed contour C n ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ln M n = − g 2 N 2π A min (C n ) . (3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The contour C n is a polygon with light-like edges [x i , x i+1 ] defined by the gluon momenta through relation (2), and with the cyclicly condition x n+1 ≡ x 1 . Notice that the x i , which correspond to the n cusps of the polygon C n , are the same dual momentum variables that were introduced previously for discussing the broken conformal properties of integrals appearing in the gluon amplitudes! The prescription of [79] is insensitive to the helicity configuration of the gluon amplitude under consideration.</p>

				<p>For n = 4 the minimal surface A min (C 4 ) was found explicitly in [79], by making use of the conformal symmetry of the problem. With the appropriate AdS equivalent of dimensional regularisation , the divergent part of ln M 4 has the expected pole structure, with the coefficient in front of the double pole given by the known strong coupling value of the cusp anomalous dimension . Most importantly, the finite part of ln M 4 is in perfect agreement with F (BDS) 4 from the BDS ansatz. For n ≥ 5 the practical evaluation of the solution of the classical string equations turns out to be difficult, but it becomes possible for n large [80]. In the limit n → ∞ the strong coupling prediction for ln M n disagrees with the BDS ansatz. This indicates [80] that the BDS conjecture should fail for a sufficiently large number of gluons and/or at sufficiently high loop level.</p>

				<p>Alday and Maldacena also pointed out [79] that their prescription (3) is mathematically equivalent to the strong coupling calculation of the expectation value of a Wilson loop W (C n ), defined on the light-like contour C n [81, 82],</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W (C n ) = 1 N 0| Tr P exp ig Cn dx µ A µ |0 . (4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This should not come as a total surprise, since the intimate relationship between the infrared divergences of the scattering of massless particles and the ultraviolet divergences of Wilson loops with cusps is well known in QCD [38, 74, 75]. Inspired by this, Drummond, Korchemsky and Sokatchev conjectured that a similar duality relation between planar MHV gluon amplitudes and light-like Wilson loops also exists at weak coupling [83]. They illustrated this duality by an explicit one-loop calculation in the simplest case n = 4. This was later extended to the case of arbitrary n at one loop by Brandhuber, Heslop and Travaglini [84]. The duality relation identifies the two objects up to an additive constant and non-planar corrections,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ln M (MHV) n = ln W (C n ) + const + O(ǫ, 1/N ) . (5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This means that upon a specific identification of the regularisation parameters and the kinematical invariants, the infrared divergences of the logarithm of the scattering amplitude ln M n , match the ultraviolet divergences of the light-like Wilson loop ln W (C n ), and, most importantly, the finite parts of the two objects also coincide (up to an additive constant and non-planar</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>rections), F (MHV) n = F (WL) n + const + O(1/N ) . (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>While the former property follows from the known structure of divergences of scattering amplitudes and of Wilson loops in generic gauge theories [38, 85, 74], the property (6) is extremely non-trivial.</p>

				<p>In this report we present work in collaboration with Drummond, Korchemsky and Sokatchev that provided further evidence in favour of the duality relation (6). To begin with, we carried out explicit two-loop calculations of ln W (C n ) for n = 4 [86] and n = 5 [87]. Our results are in perfect agreement with the two-loop MHV gluon amplitude calculations [56, 76], and hence with the BDS ansatz for n = 4, 5.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, in [86] we argued that we can profit from the (broken) conformal symmetry of the light-like Wilson loops. Due to the presence of a cusp anomaly in the Wilson loops, conformal invariance manifests itself in the form of anomalous Ward identities. In [86] we proposed and in [87] we proved an anomalous conformal Ward identity for the finite part of the Wilson loops, valid to all orders in the coupling constant 3 .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>It reads K µ F (WL) n = n i=1 2 x µ i x ν i ∂ ∂x ν i − x 2 i ∂ ∂x iµ F (WL) n = 1 2 Γ cusp (a) n i=1 ln x 2 i,i+2 x 2 i−1,i+1 x µ i,i+1 , (7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where x i,j = x i − x j and Γ cusp (a) is the (coupling-dependent) cusp anomalous dimension. This identity uniquely fixes the functional form of the finite part of ln W (C n ) for n = 4 and n = 5, up to an additive constant, to agree with the conjectured BDS form for the corresponding MHV gluon amplitudes. For n ≥ 6, (7) gives partial restrictions on the functional dependence on the kinematical variables. Quite remarkably, the BDS ansatz (1) for the n-gluon MHV amplitudes satisfies the conformal Ward identity for arbitrary n [86].</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>However, for n ≥ 6 the conformal Ward identity allows F (WL) n to differ from the BDS ansatz F (BDS) n</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>by an arbitrary function of conformal invariants (for n = 6 there are three such invariants ) [86]. This result provided a possible explanation of the BDS conjecture for n = 4, 5 (assuming that the MHV amplitudes have the same conformal properties as the Wilson loop), but left the door open for potential deviations from it for n ≥ 6. To verify whether the BDS conjecture and/or the proposed duality relation (6) still hold for n = 6 to two loops, it was necessary to perform explicit two-loop calculations of the finite parts of the six-gluon MHV amplitude F</p>

				</figure>

				<p>differs from the BDS ansatz at two loops by a non-trivial function of conformal cross-ratios. We studied this function numerically and found that it was consistent with the collinear limit (of gluon amplitudes) [90]. Later, when the results of the two-loop calculation of the six-gluon MHV amplitude became available, we compared the two results numerically and found agreement with the duality relation (6) [91, 92]. The BDS ansatz fails at two loops and at n = 6, but it fails just in such a way as to preserve the duality with Wilson loops! We take this as strong evidence that the duality relation (6) holds for arbitrary n and to an arbitrary number of loops.</p>

				<p>We would like to point out that a weaker form of the duality (6) has already been observed in QCD in the special, high-energy (Regge) limit s ≫ −t &gt; 0 for the four-gluon amplitude up to two loops [75]. The same relationship holds in any gauge theory ranging from QCD to N = 4 SYM. The essential difference between these theories is that in the former case the duality is only valid in the Regge limit, whereas in the latter case it is exact in general kinematics. We would like to mention that a thorough analysis of the Regge limit of planar multi-gluon amplitudes in N = 4 SYM was recently performed in [93, 94] and it provided further evidence that the BDS ansatz needs to be corrected [94].</p>

				<p>This report is organised as follows: Sections 2–6 are mainly introductory. In section 2, we recall some notions of conformal symmetry and its implications for correlation functions of gauge invariant operators in N = 4 SYM. section 3 briefly introduces the reader to gluon scattering amplitudes, focusing on multi-loop results for maximally helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes and the BDS conjecture. Following that, section 4 summarises the prescription of Alday and Maldacena to compute gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling. This will lead us to consider Wilson loops, and after introducing them in section 5 and summarising their renormalisation properties, we discuss in section 6 the main point of study of this thesis: the duality between gluon amplitudes and Wilson loops. The remaining sections present original work by the author and collaborators. In particular sections 2.6 and 3.2 are based on [77], and sections 7, 8, 9 and appendix B are based on [86, 87, 90, 91, 95].</p>

				<p>The only exceptions to the introductory nature of sections 2–6 are sections 2.6 and 3.2, where we present original work on off-shell conformal four-point integrals, and their relevance for onshell gluon scattering amplitudes, respectively. We study the known (to four loops) four-gluon scattering amplitude in N = 4 SYM and find that it is given in terms of &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; integrals.</p>

				<p>In section 7, we verify the Wilson loop/gluon amplitude duality in the non-trivial cases of four and five points/gluons at two loops by an explicit Feynman graph calculation of the rectangular and pentagonal Wilson loops.</p>

				<p>In section 8, we derive all-order Ward identities for the light-like Wilson loops and discuss their consequences.</p>

				<p>From this discussion of the Ward identities in section 8 it will become clear that a crucial test of the duality is at two loops and for six points/gluons. We therefore compute the hexagonal Wilson loop at two loops in section 9 and study its properties in the collinear limit (of gluon amplitudes). We present a numerical comparison with recently available results for the six-gluon MHV amplitude at two loops.</p>

				<p>In section 10, we present our conclusions.</p>

				<head n="2">(Super-)conformal symmetry</head>

				<p>Conformal symmetry in quantum field theory was extensively studied beginning from the late 1960&apos;s, see e.g. [96, 97] and references therein. The conformal properties of correlation functions were studied. Conformal symmetry has very strong consequences in two dimensions, where the conformal group has an infinite number of generators. In four-dimensional field theories, which are more relevant for particle physics, the conformal group has only 15 parameters, and as a consequence, it is less restrictive than in two dimensions. Moreover, in generic field theories, conformal symmetry is broken by quantum corrections. An example is (massless) QCD. Nevertheless , studying the deviation from conformal invariance can be useful in practice, as discussed in the review [98]. The situation is much better in a field theory which is conformally invariant also at the quantum level. As we will see in section 2.4, the maximally supersymmetric</p>

				<head n="2.1">Definition of conformal transformations</head>

				<p>The presentation of conformal symmetry follows roughly chapter four of the book [101], where the reader can find more details. Let us consider a d-dimensional space with flat metric η µν (the treatment for Euclidean and Minkowski space is identical). By definition, conformal transformations leave the metric invariant up to a local rescaling</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>x µ → x ′ µ , dx µ dx µ → Λ(x)dx ′ µ dx ′ µ . (8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Geometrically, (8) means that conformal transformations preserve angles. In order to find the most general solution to (8), consider an arbitrary infinitesimal coordinate transformation</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>x µ → x ′ µ = x µ + ǫ µ (x) . (9)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>It is then easy to show that in d &gt; 2 dimensions, the most general form of ǫ µ compatible with (8) is given by ǫ µ = a µ + m µν x ν + λx µ + 2(b · x)x µ − b µ x 2 , m µν = −m νµ , (10) where we used the notations b·x = b ν x ν and x 2 = x ν x ν . The two-dimensional case is special and we will not treat it here, since we are interested in d = 4. For more information on conformal symmetry in two dimensions, see for example [101]. The infinitesimal transformations in (10) corresponding to the parameters a µ and m µν are translations and rotations, respectively. Thus the Poincaré group is a subgroup of the conformal group. The transformations corresponding to λ and b ν are dilatations, and special conformal transformations, respectively. Let us define generators for the infinitesimal transformations according to x ′ ρ = (1 + ia µ P µ + im µν M µν + iλD + ib µ K µ )x ρ . (11)</p>

				<p>By comparing (11) and (10) it is easy to see that the generators of the conformal group are given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>P µ = −i∂ µ , M µν = i(x µ ∂ ν − x ν ∂ µ ) , D = −ix µ ∂ µ , K µ = −i(2x µ x ν ∂ ν − x 2 ∂ µ ) . (12)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here we used the shorthand notation ∂ µ = ∂ ∂x µ . From (12) we can see that the conformal group in four dimensions has 15 generators, i.e. four translation generators P µ , six rotations M µν , a dilatation D and four special conformal boosts K µ .</p>

				<p>In addition to the usual commutation relations of the Poincaré algebra, [P µ , P ν ] = 0 , [M µν , P ρ ] = i(η νρ P µ − η µρ P ν ) , [M µν , M ρσ ] = i(−η µσ M νρ + η νσ M µρ + η µρ M νσ − η νρ M µσ ) , (13) the generators (12) have the following commutation relations: [D, P µ ] = iP µ , [K ρ , M µν ] = i(η ρµ K ν − η ρν K µ ) , [D, K µ ] = −iK µ , [K µ , P ν ] = 2i(η µν D − M µν ) . (14)</p>

				<p>Relations (13) and (14) define the conformal algebra.</p>

				<p>Let us now consider finite conformal transformations. For translations P µ , rotations M µν and dilatations D, the form of the finite transformations are easy to find. Furthermore, it is possible to show that the finite transformation corresponding to the infinitesimal conformal boosts is given by x ′ µ = x µ − b µ x 2 1 − 2b · x + b 2 x 2 . (15)</p>

				<p>For practical purposes it is convenient to introduce another finite transformation, the inversion,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>I : x µ → x µ x 2 . (16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The special conformal transformation (15) can be obtained by composing an inversion, a translation by −b µ , and another inversion. Because of this, it will often be convenient to check the conformal invariance (or covariance) of a given translation invariant expression by doing inversions (16) rather than the more complicated special conformal transformations (15). In particular, inversions will be useful to us in order to determine the consequences of conformal symmetry on correlation functions. Note that the inversion (16) is an element of the conformal group not connected to the identity. In other words, there is no infinitesimal generator corresponding to (16).</p>

				<p>So far we discussed the action of the conformal group on coordinates. In a quantum field theory, one has to define the action of the conformal generators on fields as well. The conformal generators acting on fundamental fields φ I (x) with conformal weight ∆ and Lorentz indices I</p>

				<figure>

				<p>Here m µν is the generator of spin rotations, e.g., m µν = 0 for a scalar field and (m µν ) λ ρ = g νρ δ µ λ − g µρ δ ν λ for a gauge field. From (17) one can in principle determine the variation of fields under finite transformations. For example, a scalar conformal field has the transformation property</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>φ(x) → φ ′ (x ′ ) = ∂x ′ ∂x −∆/d φ(x) , (18) where ∆ is the conformal dimension of φ(x). Here ∂x ′ ∂x = Λ(x) −d/2 (19)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>is the Jacobian of the conformal transformation of coordinates, c.f. (8). Fields obeying (18) are called primary.</p>

				<p>As was already said, we will consider conformal symmetry in four dimensions only. Examples of classically conformal field theories are theories which have only dimensionless parameters in the action (i.e. dimensionless coupling constant, no masses). An explicit example is the scalar φ 4 model in four dimensions, whose action reads</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S = d 4 x 1 2 ∂ µ φ(x)∂ µ φ(x) + g 4! φ 4 (x) . (20)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Under translations and rotations, the scalar field transforms as φ ′ (x ′ ) = φ(x), so that (20) is invariant under Poincaré transformations. Further, one can see that (20) is invariant under dilatations and special conformal transformations, if φ(x) transforms according to (18) with weight ∆ = 1. Note that the coupling constant g in (20) is dimensionless. Dimensional parameters in the Lagrangian, as for example m corresponding to a mass term m 2 φ 2 (x), would spoil conformal symmetry.</p>

				<p>Let us stress that the conformal invariance of (20) is only valid classically, and it is broken by quantum corrections. The reason for this is that due to ultraviolet divergences, the coupling constant g and the elementary field φ have to be renormalised. This is done in the usual way by introducing appropriate renormalisation factors Z φ , Z g [102]. The net result is that the renormalised coupling constant g depends on the renormalisation scale µ, i.e. the β function is nonvanishing,</p>

					<trash>µ dg dµ = β(g) = 0 . (21)</trash>

				<p>In this section, we briefly review the implications of conformal symmetry for correlation functions . For a comprehensive review of conformal symmetry in quantum field theory, see e.g. [96, 97].</p>

				<p>In a conformal field theory one usually considers primary operators because they have simple transformation properties under conformal transformations, see (18).</p>

				<p>Requiring conformal covariance of these operators under conformal transformations according to (18) restrains the functional form that their correlation functions can have.

			<div>
				<head n="2.2.1">Two-point functions</head>

				<p>Take for example two scalar operators O 1 and O 2 possessing conformal dimension ∆ 1 and ∆ 2 , respectively. Under conformal transformations their two-point function has to transform according to (18), i.e.</p>

				<p>Three-point functions of operators with spin are also constrained. For example, consider a spin one operator V µ of conformal dimension ∆ 1 = 3 (for example a conserved current). Its three-point function with two scalar fields of conformal dimension ∆ 2 = ∆ 3 = 2 is</p>

				<head n="2.4.2">Finiteness</head>

				<p>The form and relative factors in (44) are completely fixed by N = 4 supersymmetry, and for the same reason there is just one coupling constant g. A special property of N = 4 SYM is that its superconformal symmetry is not broken by quantum corrections. The β function of N = 4 SYM was shown to vanish up to three loops by direct calculations [114, 115, 116]. Furthermore, there exist several arguments for the vanishing of the β function to all loops [117, 118, 119, 120, 121]. For more details and further references, see the review [112].</p>

				<p>Let us remark on different formalisms in which N = 4 SYM can be studied. Unfortunately, an off-shell N = 4 formalism is not available to date, and there are reasons to believe that it does not exist. For this reason one has to resort to less supersymmetric formalisms. For example , one can very well use the action (44), after the usual gauge fixing procedure, for practical calculations. However, it may be advantageous to utilise a manifestly supersymmetric setup, either for calculational convenience, or because of conceptual advantages. For example, one can take a formulation of N = 4 SYM in terms of N = 1 superfields. We will give the necessary definitions in the next section, and present a sample calculation in section 2.5.4. It is also possible to use a manifestly N = 2 supersymmetric formalism, which employs harmonic superspace [122]. For examples of recent calculations in this setup, see [123, 124]. Further, there is even a N = 3 harmonic superspace formalism [122], and its quantisation was considered in [125]. However up to now, no supergraph calculations were carried out in this formalism.</p>

				<p>Let us clarify a point that might otherwise lead to confusion. N = 4 SYM is often referred to as a &apos;finite&apos; field theory. In a supersymmetric formalism, it is indeed true that propagators and the coupling constant acquire no or only finite corrections in perturbative calculations. On the other hand, in a non-supersymmetric gauge (e.g. the Wess-Zumino gauge), the gauge dependent propagators do get divergent corrections and need to be renormalised by appropriate wavefunction renormalisations, and the same is true for the coupling constant. It is only the β function (which is gauge independent) that vanishes.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, even in a finite superspace setup, divergences can and usually do arise when one studies composite operators. The latter are traces of products of several operators at the same space-time point. Such operators generically have short distance singularities which have to be regularised. We will see an example in section 2.5.</p>

				<head n="2.5">Consequences of conformal symmetry for perturbative calculations</head>

				<p>In this section, we give a number of examples to show how the abstract conformal correlation functions discussed in section 2.2 are implemented in N = 4 SYM. A subtlety arises because the gauge fixing procedure usually (e.g. when using a covariant gauge) breaks the conformal invariance of the action following from (44). Therefore, the conformal predictions for correlation functions of section 2.2 only apply to gauge invariant quantities, in which the gauge dependent variation of the gauge fixing term drops out.</p>

				<p>In the next section we give examples of gauge-invariant operators. Then, we introduce the concept of anomalous dimensions and briefly discuss operator mixing in a conformal field theory. Finally, in section 2.5.4 we show how a particular four-point function can be used to compute anomalous dimensions using the operator product expansion.</p>

				<head n="2.5.1">Gauge invariant operators</head>

				<p>From what was just said it is clear that in order for conformal properties to be manifest, one should consider gauge independent quantities. There are different possibilities. For example, one can take a trace over several elementary fields multiplied together at the same space-time point. For the gauge group SU (N ), the minimal number of fields is two, since Tr(t a ) = 0.</p>

				<p>Let us give two examples which often appear in the literature on N = 4 SYM. The first,</p>

From the point of view of representation theory of P SU (2, 2|4), Q ij 20 ′ belongs to a short representation of fixed conformal dimension ∆ = 2 [127]. Thus, its conformal dimension stays at its classical value to all orders in perturbation theory. Furthermore, it is known (see e.g. the review [128]) that two-and three-point function of (50) do not receive quantum corrections.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Let us briefly remark on the topic of operator mixing (cf. e.g. [102]) in the context of a conformal field theory [104, 131, 132, 133, 134]. Operator mixing occurs, generally speaking, when there are several operators that have the same quantum numbers. A particular example that often appears in the literature are operators in the sl(2)-sector of N = 4 SYM, see e.g. [17, 124]. Of these, the twist-two operators 8 are built from two elementary fields, e.g. φ 1 and an arbitrary number j of (covariant) derivatives D µ . For j = 0, we already encountered one of these operators in the form of C 11 =</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>φ 1 φ 1 . For general (even) j, they read O j = j k=0 c jk O jk , O jk = tr D {µ 1 . . . D µ k φ 1 D µ k+1 . . . D µ j } φ 1 . (64)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here, the curly brackets stand for traceless symmetrisation of the vector indices, so that O j is in a representation of spin j. In a generic situation, there is more than one possible distribution of the derivatives on the two fields φ 1 , which is reflected by the sum in (64) with a priori arbitrary coefficients c jk . As a consequence, the operators O jk for a given j mix under renormalisation.</p>

				<p>In a generic quantum field theory, the mixing matrix c jk at order g n can be determined by a calculation at order g (n+2) . In a conformal field theory, this mixing problem can be resolved using conformal methods that significantly reduce the complexity of the calculations [104, 131].</p>

				<p>We developed these methods further in [135]. As a particular example, we were able to determine the mixing matrix c jk at order g 2 by evaluating only order g Feynman graphs, compared to a conventional calculation at order g 4 . Similarly, the computation of the anomalous dimensions of the twist two operators in (64) can also be reduced in loop order (by one unit of g 2 ).</p>

				<p>One might object that the resolution of the mixing problem is not relevant, since it is known that mixing matrices are scheme dependent. This scheme dependence, however, is under control and is governed by a renormalisation group equation. Moreover, one can define a conformal scheme, in which the properties of conformal correlation functions are realised (see e.g. the review [98]). In contrast, in a generic scheme, such as for example minimal subtraction, the conformal properties discussed in section 2.2 are in general not present.</p>

				<p>The anomalous dimensions of the operators in (64) have received considerable attention recently. They are known up to two loops and conjectured at three loops [136]. They are also predicted by a conjectured integrable model [30]. It would be desirable to confirm these conjectures to three loops and beyond. A promising technique to achieve this is the determination of the anomalous dimensions through the operator product expansion (OPE) of conformal four-point functions. We conclude this introductory section with a one-loop example of this technique.</p>

				<head n="2.5.4">Conformal four-point functions</head>

				<p>Let us consider the four-point function of Q ij 20 ′ . We already saw in section 2.5.2 that Q ij 20 ′ does not need to be renormalised. Its conformal dimension is equal to its classical dimension, ∆ = 2.</p>

				<p>The correlator (65) is known up to two loops in perturbation theory [137, 126]. One reason for being interested in it is that the function f (u, v; g 2 ) allows to determine the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two operators (64) via the operator product expansion (OPE). This relation has been worked out in [138, 139]. As was already discussed, the two-point functions of chiral primary operators that could in principle contribute to the disconnected piece of (65) vanish (up to possible contact terms, see e.g. [140] for a discussion).

				<p>Since rotation and translation invariance are manifest, we conclude that the integral is given by a conformally covariant combination of propagators multiplied by a function of the conformally invariant cross-ratios (30), in agreement with (65).</p>

				<p>The function Φ (1) (u, v) has been calculated in [142, 143], where it was also shown that the same function appears in a three-point integral. The latter can be obtained from the four-point one by sending one of the points to infinity [141]. We can multiply equation (70) by x 2 13 , say, and then take the limit x 3 −→ ∞.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>This gives, h (1) 3pt (x 1 , x 2 , x 4 ) = lim x 3 →∞ x 2 13 h (1) (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) = d 4 x 5 x 2 15 x 2 25 x 2 45 = 1 x 2 24 Φ (1) (ˆ u, ˆ v), (73) where the cross-ratios u and v have becomê u and v in the limit, u −→ u = x 2 12 x 2 24 , v −→ v = x 2 14 x 2 24 . (74)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Thus the three-point integral contains the same information as the four-point integral, i.e. the same function of two variables. The reason is that one can use translations and conformal inversion to take the point x 3 to infinity and the function of the cross-ratios is invariant under these transformations. The explicit formula for Φ (1) is [144]</p>

				<p>One can in principle determine the anomalous dimensions at higher orders in perturbation theory from the four-point function (65). It has been computed to two loops in perturbation theory [137, 126]. It would be very interesting to determine its three-loop, i.e. order g 6 , correction in order to test the conjectured formula [136] for the twist-two anomalous dimensions at three loops. Moreover, one may wonder whether the conjectured integrability of N = 4 SYM contrains the four-point function itself, beyond the contraints coming from conformal symmetry?</p>

				<head n="2.6">Conformal four-point integrals</head>

				<p>In section 2.5.4 we saw that from the four-point function of chiral primary operators (65) one can deduce the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two operators (64). Due to the absence of divergences of the chiral primaries, such four-point functions are finite and do not require any regulator. Because of its conformality, a calculation at a given loop order (e.g. with Feynman diagrams) must eventually yield an expression in terms of (finite) conformal integrals. In [77], we took this as a motivation to study an infinite class of conformal four-point integrals. We found that there are simple identities between integrals corresponding to different diagrams. We describe these &apos;magic identities&apos; in this section.</p>

				<p>At the same time, let us stress that in this report, the interest in the conformal integrals mainly comes from an entirely different motivation. We found that, very surprisingly, conformal integrals also appear in the completely unrelated context of on-shell gluon scattering amplitudes in momentum space. As will be explained in section 3.2, their appearance suggests that the latter have a (broken) conformal symmetry in a dual space defined through the gluon momenta.</p>

				<p>We hope that the example of (65), which illustrates where conformal integrals normally appear (off-shell, finite, in x-space) helps clarifying the difference to the integrals that appear when analysing on-shell gluon scattering amplitudes (which are on-shell, IR-divergent, and defined in momentum space) in section 3.2.</p>

				<p>The identity we have obtained at three loops is just the first example of an infinite set of identities which all come from the turning symmetry of subintegrals. We generate (n + 1)-loop integrals by integrating n-loop integrals against the slingshot in all possible orientations. The resulting integrals are equal by turning identities of the form (80). At two loops we get just one integral (the two-loop ladder). At three loops we have already seen two equivalent integrals (ladder and tennis court). At four loops we generate two equivalent integrals from the three-loop ladder and three equivalent integrals from the tennis court. Finally, all five four-loop integrals obtained in this way are equivalent by the three-loop identity for the ladder and tennis court (see Fig. 11).</p>

				<p>In general it is more common to give the diagrams in the &apos;momentum&apos; representation (which has nothing to do with the Fourier transform) where we regard the integrations as integrals over loop momenta rather than coordinate space vertices. This representation is neater but the numerators need to be described separately as they do not appear in the diagrams. The momentum-space version of the four generations of integrals from Fig. 11 is given in Fig. 12. The transition between the two notations will be discussed in more detail in section 3. As was already mentioned, integrals related to the ones discussed here will reappear in the analysis of loop corrections to gluon scattering amplitudes in section 3.2.

					<trash>3 Gluon amplitudes in N = 4 SYM 3.1 Introduction</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>What are the motivations for computing scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM? There are several answers to this question. Firstly, being four-dimensional gauge theories, N = 4 SYM and QCD share some properties, but calculations are generally much harder in the latter. Having efficient calculational methods for computing QCD amplitudes is important for collider physics. The Figure 12: The momentum notation for our integrals up to four loops. The slingshot translates into the top box in each diagram, beneath which are the integrals at one loop lower, arranged in all possible orientations. The ladder series is again in the left-most column. reason is that in searches for new physics, the theoretical uncertainties for the standard model background processes are often high, in particular in proton-proton collisions [146]. N = 4 SYM can be used as a testing ground for new calculational methods. Moreover, a part of QCD amplitudes can be predicted from their N = 4 counterparts. For example, tree-level gluon amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills are identical to those in N = SYM. This follows simply from the Feynman rules. Further, at one loop, gluon amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills can be decomposed in the following way:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A g = (A g + 4A f + 3A s N =4 ) − 4(A f + A s N =1 ) + A s . (92)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here the abbreviations g, f, s stand for gluon, fermion, and scalar, respectively. They denote the particles circulating in the one-loop diagrams. In this way, a generic one-loop Yang-Mills amplitude can be written in terms of two supersymmetric amplitudes and an amplitude with a scalar circulating in the loop, which is much simpler than the original amplitude.</p>

				<p>Another motivation comes from the fact that, as we will discuss in this section, scattering amplitudes contain the cusp anomalous dimension Γ cusp , which has received considerable attention over the last years in the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Its value is predicted (in principle at any given order) from conjectured integrable models that describe the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in N = 4 SYM. Therefore, knowing Γ cusp to high orders in perturbation theory is important to test and fine-tune these models. The three-and four-loop values of Γ cusp were indeed computed via four-gluon scattering amplitudes.</p>

				<p>Gluon scattering amplitudes in N = 4 are also studied within the relation between N = 4 SYM and N = 8 supergravity [147], see [148] for a review. This may give new insights into the ultraviolet properties of N = 8 supergravity, see [149] and references therein for a recent discussion.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Finally, the scattering amplitudes themselves reveal interesting properties, on which we will focus in this report. As will be described in this section, an iterative structure for the scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM was uncovered by Anastasiou, Bern, Dixon and Kosower (ABDK) [56] and generalised to higher loops by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov (BDS) [39]. In particular, it turns out that their finite part seems to be much simpler than could be expected on general grounds. These discoveries give hope that scattering amplitudes in the large N limit of N = 4 SYM may be solvable.</p>

				<p>Let us consider an n-gluon scattering amplitude in N = 4 SYM, as shown in Fig. 13. All gluons are treated as ingoing, furthermore they are massless and on-shell. They are characterised by their momenta p i (with p 2 i = 0), their helicity h i = ±1 and their colour index (in the adjoint representation of the gauge group SU (N )). There is momentum conservation, i.e. n i=1 p µ i = 0. Taking the gluon momenta on-shell introduces infrared (IR) divergences that have to be regularised. For this one usually uses a supersymmetry preserving regulator, such as for example dimensional reduction (or a variant of it, the four-dimensional helicity scheme [150, 151]). We will discuss the structure of IR divergences in section 3.1.2.</p>

				<p>A generic contribution to an n-gluon scattering amplitude can consist of a vast number of terms. For this reason it is very convenient to classify the amplitudes according to their quantum numbers. Let us start by considering the colour structure of the amplitudes. It is clear that the gauge theory factor of a given contribution to the amplitude can be written as a trace or a product of several traces over colour matrices. We are interested in the large N limit, so we neglect multiple traces. It is convenient to define partial amplitudes which correspond to one particular colour structure,</p>

				<p>Here q µ is an arbitrary (up to q µ = p µ ) reference momentum. A change in q µ corresponds to a gauge transformation. More information on the spinor helicity notation can be found for example in [152, 153].</p>

				<p>In N = 4 SYM, one can define analogous scattering amplitudes where some of the gluons are replaced by fermions or scalars. By requiring invariance of the S-matrix under supersymmetry transformations and the invariance of the vacuum state |0, [154, 155], one can derive relations between scattering amplitudes involving different particles and/or helicities. The action of the N = 4 supersymmetry generators on gluons g ± , fermions f ± i , and scalars s ij is [152] [Q i (q, θ), g + (k)] = θ [kq]</p>

				<p>Furthermore, relations between amplitudes with different particles can be obtained from supersymmetry . Given (99) and (100), the first non-zero pure gluon amplitude has two flipped helicities, and is called maximally helicity-violating (MHV),</p>

				<p>MHV amplitudes have the special property that for them, there is only one possible helicity structure, and hence it can be factorised. Using the shorthand notation p i p j = i j, we have for n ≥ 4 12 [47, 48], up to an inessential normalisation</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Here M n is a function of the momentum invariants p i · p j and of the dimensional regulator only. We already said that four-and five-gluon amplitudes are special because all of them are MHV. In contrast, amplitudes with more than two flipped helicities have a more complicated form. Their loop corrections involve in general new helicity structures, and hence they are not proportional to the tree level term. It remains an interesting open question how to extend the duality between Wilson loops and MHV gluon amplitudes discussed in this report to those amplitudes.</p>

				<head n="3.1.2">Infrared divergences</head>

				<p>As we already mentioned, the on-shell amplitudes suffer from infrared divergences. In dimensional regularisation, the divergences appear as poles in the regulator ǫ. The structure of these divergences is well understood in any gauge theory [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]. In order to explain the general structure, let us proceed by giving an example. Consider the one-loop corrections to the four-gluon amplitude. They can be written as [155]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(with a = g 2 N /(8π 2 )) A 4 = A tree 4 1 − a 2 stI (1) (s, t; ǫ) + O(a 2 ) , (106) where the one-loop scalar box integral I (1) is defined by I (1) = 1 4 3 2 = C d 4−2ǫ k k 2 (k − p 1 ) 2 (k − p 1 − p 2 ) 2 (k + p 4 ) 2 , (107) where C = µ 2ǫ e −ǫγ E (4π) −2+ǫ and s = (p 1 + p 2 ) 2 and t = (p 2 + p 3 ) 2 are the usual Mandelstam variables. I (1</trash>

				<p>) has infrared divergences coming from two regimes: the soft regime where k 2 ∼ 0, and the collinear regime where k µ ∼ p µ , with p µ being one of the on-shell momenta entering the scattering process.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Evaluating (107) one finds, up to terms vanishing as O(ǫ), A 4 = A tree 4 1 − a ǫ 2 µ 2 −s ǫ 1 − a ǫ 2 µ 2 −t ǫ 1 + a 1 2 ln 2 s t + 4ζ 2 + O(a 2 , ǫ) . (108)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We can see from (108) that the loop corrections to A 4 factorise into divergent pieces, each depending on one kinematical variable only, and a finite part. This factorised structure is known to hold to higher loop orders as well (in the planar case). For non-MHV amplitudes, the only difference compared to (108) is that the finite part in general depends on the helicity structure of the amplitude as well. As we already pointed out, at four points there are only MHV amplitudes, and this problem does not appear. Their general form is known to factorise [64, 71, 156, 157] according to</p>

				<p>where div(x) contains all poles in ǫ and fin(x) is finite as ǫ → 0. Notice that the finite part was chosen such that it is independent of the dimensional regularisation parameter µ. The dependence on it is contained in the divergent part and in O(ǫ) terms only. The divergent factors in (109) are governed by an evolution equation [158, 68, 159, 160, 70]. For theories with vanishing β function, such as N = 4 SYM 13 the factors containing the divergences take the particularly simple form</p>

					<trash>div(x) = exp − 1 2 ∞ l=1 a l x lǫ Γ (l) cusp (lǫ) 2 + G (l) lǫ , (110) where Γ cusp (a) = l a l Γ (l) cusp , G(a) = l a l G (l) cusp . (111)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here Γ cusp is the cusp anomalous dimension (of Wilson loops), and G is the scheme-dependent collinear anomalous dimension. Their perturbative expansion in the coupling constant up to two loops is (in the DRED scheme)</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Γ cusp (a) = 2a − 2ζ 2 a 2 + O(a 3 ) , G(a) = −ζ 3 a 2 + O(a 3 ) . (112)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We can see that (108) is indeed of the factorised form expected on general grounds, see formula (109), and the coefficient in front of the double pole agrees with the known expression (112) at one-loop for the cusp anomalous dimension.</p>

				<p>By definition [36, 37, 38], the cusp anomalous dimension Γ cusp (a) describes specific ultraviolet divergences of a Wilson loop evaluated over a contour with a cusp. Its appearance in the infrared divergent part of the scattering amplitude (110) is not accidental. It has its roots in the deep relation between scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and Wilson loops evaluated over specific contours in Minkowski space-time, defined by the particle momenta [37, 159, 75]. A distinguishing feature of this contour is that it has cusps. As was found in Refs. [37, 159, 75], the infrared divergences of planar scattering amplitudes are in one-to-one correspondence with the cusp ultraviolet divergences of light-like Wilson loops. It should be mentioned that this relation is not specific to N = 4 SYM and it holds in any gauge theory, including QCD. We explain this relationship in a one-loop example in section 6.1.</p>

				<p>The two-loop expression for Γ cusp (a) in a generic (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory was found in Refs. [38, 16]. We remark that in N = 4 SYM theory, Γ cusp (a) is known at weak coupling to four loops [40], and it is conjectured to be governed to all loops by the BES equation [30]. At strong coupling, the solution of the latter produces a strong coupling expansion of Γ cusp (a) [44, 45, 46]. The first few terms of this expansion are in agreement with the existing quantum superstring calculation of Refs. [41, 42, 43]. The non-universal collinear anomalous dimension G(a) is known to four loops at weak coupling [39, 161] and there exists a prediction at strong coupling [79].</p>

				</figure>

				<p>i ≡ s i,i+1 = (p i + p i+1 ) 2 is the invariant mass of two adjacent gluons with indices i and i + 1, and the periodicity condition i + n ≡ i is tacitly implied. The finite part F n = F n (t [j] i ) is a dimensionless function of the momentum invariants t [j] i = (p i + . . . p i+j−1 ) 2 of the scattering process 14 . From (113) we can see that MHV amplitudes contain two interesting pieces of information: the cusp anomalous dimension Γ cusp in the double pole term, and an a priori arbitrary function of the momentum invariants in the finite part. What makes the latter particularly interesting is that it turns out not to be arbitrary, but seems to have a very simple form, as we will discuss in section 3.1.4. In some sense, the finite part F n is more interesting than Γ cusp because at a given loop order, it is a function (in general of many variables), whereas Γ (l) cusp is merely one number. Finally, note that G is scheme dependent because one can always arbitrarily redefine the dimensional regularisation scale µ. For the same reason F n contains in general a scheme-dependent constant, but its functional form is scheme independent.</p>

			<div>
				<head n="3.1.3">Calculational technique</head>

				<p>The loop corrections to M 4 can be represented in terms of scalar loop integrals, as for example the scalar box integral I (1) encountered in the previous section. How do these integrals arise? In a standard approach, one would write down all Feynman graphs contributing to a given amplitude, involving gluons, fermions, scalars, and also ghosts. Then, one has to work out the numerator algebra in the integrals corresponding to these graphs. Usually one also has to use integral reduction identities in order to express the amplitude in terms of master integrals [162]. One can think of the scalar integrals as the result of going through this (lengthy) procedure. With increasing loop order (or number of gluons) this approach involves writing down a large number of Feynman graphs and would be very cumbersome if not impossible. For example, even the tree level formula (104) for large n would require writing down an astronomical number of Feynman graphs, since their number grows factorially with n.</p>

				<p>This is why one often employs a different technique based on the unitarity of the S-matrix, see [163] and references therein. The latter, which describes the scattering of particles in a 14 Note that Fn does not depend on all t [j] i independently, because (more than four) four-dimensional vectors have to satisfy Gram determinant constraints.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>If one inserts a complete set of states between T and T † on the right-hand side of (116), one gets the diagrammatical relation shown in Fig. 14. There, the sum is over all allowed intermediate states and the integral is over their on-shell momenta.</p>

				<p>Equation (116) relates objects at different orders in perturbation theory. For example, the imaginary part of a one-loop amplitude on its left-hand side is expressed through tree-level amplitudes on its right-hand side. One can think of the r.h.s. as being a one-loop amplitude that was cut into two tree-level pieces.</p>

				<p>In the unitarity based method of Bern et al [52, 53], one does not compute the integral on the right-hand side of (116) directly. Rather, the idea is to reconstruct the amplitudes from their cuts. More precisely, one uses (116) in order to construct the loop integrand of integrals that have the correct behaviour under unitarity cuts. A generic one-loop amplitude can be expressed in terms of master integrals by integral reduction techniques [162]. Therefore it is sufficient to know the coefficients with which the master integrals contribute to the amplitude. Moreover, in supersymmetric field theories, it is known from integral reduction methods, combined with power counting arguments, that only a certain subclass of scalar integrals can appear in the amplitude [53]. All of them have either s-or t-channel cuts, so they can be detected by the corresponding cuts. Therefore, one-loop amplitudes in N = 4 SYM are &apos;cut-constructible&apos;.</p>

				<p>Let us give a one-loop example of the cutting technique, following [153]. Consider the fourgluon amplitude A 4 (1 − , 2 − , 3 + , 4 + ) at one loop. From the s-channel cut, we have</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Here the cut momenta are l 1 = k and l 2 = k − p 1 − p 2 , with k being the loop momentum. The sum in (117) is over all allowed particles and helicity states for the cut lines. In this example, due to supersymmetric Ward identities, the contribution of scalars and fermions to (117) vanishes. Hence, the only non-vanishing contribution comes from gluon tree amplitudes with the following</p>

				<p>One-loop amplitudes in supersymmetric theories were shown to be &apos;cut-constructible&apos; in the above sense. We remark that in non-supersymmetric theories, there are rational terms in the amplitude that cannot be detected by cuts, and have to be determined by other means. This problem can be solved, however, by using D-dimensional cuts. The reason is that in D dimensions , the rational terms produce cuts that can be detected. This approach further uses a supersymmetric decomposition of one-loop amplitudes (92). This means that only cuts of scalar loops have to be evaluated in D dimensions. These techniques have allowed the computation of several QCD amplitudes at one loop.</p>

				<p>In N = 4 SYM the cutting techniques were successfully applied to higher loop amplitudes as well. They allowed the computation of amplitudes that would have been practically impossible to determine on the basis of Feynman diagrams. We will summarise the results for MHV amplitudes in N = 4 SYM in the next section. Finally, we mention another important development, that of &apos;generalised cuts&apos;, where one requires more than two propagators to be on shell, see [164]</p>

				<p>Over the last thirty years, considerable efforts have been undertaken to compute loop corrections to scattering amplitudes in QCD and its supersymmetric extensions, see e.g. the review [57]. Most progress has been made for MHV amplitudes in N = 4 SYM. Up to now, the following MHV amplitudes have been computed in N = 4 SYM: • four gluons at two loops [55, 56] and three loops [39]; the four-gluon amplitude is known in terms of loop integrals at four loops [40], and the integrals were evaluated (numerically) up to the second pole term, which allowed to determine Γ cusp at four loops; a conjecture for the integrals appearing at five loops was put forward in [78] • five gluons to two loops [165, 76] • six gluons to two loops [92] • n gluons to one loop [52] Similar computations in QCD are much harder and up to now are restricted to lower loop orders.</p>

				<p>, Anastasiou, Bern, Dixon and Kosower (ABDK) noticed an interesting iterative structure in the two-loop result for the four-gluon amplitude in N = 4 SYM. Based on [56] and the result of their three-loop calculation, Bern, Dixon and Smirnov (BDS) formulated a conjecture for the n-gluon amplitudes in N = 4 SYM to all orders in the coupling constant [39]. As we already discussed, the divergent part of the scattering amplitudes is well understood, so their conjecture is essentially a statement about the finite part. Their conjecture implies that the finite part F n , c.f. (113) has the same functional form as at one loop, F</p>

				<p>Why should the finite part of the amplitudes be so simple? One might speculate that some symmetry could be at the origin of this simplicity. In the next section, we will study the four-gluon amplitude in more detail. We will see that indeed one can observe &apos;dual&apos; conformal properties of the integrals contributing to it, thus providing hints for a broken conformal symmetry governing the gluon amplitudes. We will see in section 8 that the conjectured duality with</p>

				<p>We should stress that very recently, the BDS conjecture was found to fail at six gluons and two loops [92]. We will see in section 9 that it is modified in a way predicted by the duality (5) between Wilson loops and gluon amplitudes. The duality, if true, also implies that the BDS conjecture is correct for four and five gluons to all loops (which is consistent with all available data).</p>

				<p>Dual conformal properties of the four-gluon amplitude Let us focus for now on four-gluon amplitudes, where results from high-order calculations in perturbation theory are available. We will see in this section that the integrals contributing to the four-gluon amplitude are all from a set of &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; integrals, in the sense that will be defined presently.</p>

				<p>Let us come back to the scalar box integral (107). An important observation made in [77] is that it has particular properties in a dual &apos;coordinate&apos; space, defined by the change of variables</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>p 1 = x 1 − x 2 ≡ x 12 , p 2 = x 23 , p 3 = x 34 , p 4 = x 41 . (127)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We stress that (127) is simply a change of variables, and not a Fourier transform. Under the identification (127) and that of k = x 15 , one obtains the expression</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>I (1) (s, t; ǫ) = C d 4−2ǫ k k 2 (k − p 1 ) 2 (k − p 1 − p 2 ) 2 (k + p 4 ) 2 = C d 4−2ǫ x 5 x 2 15 x 2 25 x 2 35 x 2 45 . (128)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The integral together with its dual picture is shown in Fig. 15. The point is that in the dual &apos;coordinate&apos; space defined by (127), the integral I (1) has (broken) conformal properties. Indeed, if it was not for the on-shell conditions p 2 i = 0 which lead us to use dimensional regularisation, I (1) would be given by the finite off-shell conformal integral Φ (1) encountered in section 2.5.4. Recall that Φ (1) is conformal because under a conformal inversion, the variation of the integral measure is precisely canceled by the variation of the four propagators going to the vertex. In D = 4 − 2ǫ, we see that the cancelation is no longer exact, and hence the (dual) conformal symmetry is broken. So we conclude that I (1) has broken conformal properties in the dual coordinate space.</p>

				<p>In order to avoid confusion with (broken) conformal Ward identities for Wilson loops discussed in later parts of this thesis, we will call integrals of this type &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; [40].</p>

				<p>At this stage one might think that the appearance of the pseudo-conformal integral I (1) is just a one-loop coincidence. However, we will see presently that this pattern continues to hold to higher loops. At two loops,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Going to dual coordinates (c.f. Fig. 15), we see that it is the dimensionally continued version of Φ (2) considered in section 2.6. Notice the dotted line between external points one and three, which is there to make sure that all external points have the same conformal weight. There is an easy way to implement the change of variables (127) by using the following pictorial rule: • for each loop integration in p-space, draw a dot inside the loop, which corresponds to an integration vertex in the dual coordinate space.</p>

				<p>• the external points in the dual coordinate space are situated between two consecutive external momenta, denote them by a point. • draw a straight line between points that are separated by a momentum line.</p>

				<p>The numerator lines have to be added by going through the change of variables (127). For pseudo-conformal integrals they are usually easy to find since they have to be chosen such that each integration vertex has conformal weight four, and from the convention that external points have conformal weight one.</p>

				<p>We remark that the notion of dual graphs exists for planar graphs only [166]. For this reason it is not clear how to apply this notion to non-planar corrections to gluon scattering amplitudes.</p>

Its expression contains a numerator (p + r) 2 (which is not depicted in the momentum space picture), given by x 2 15 in the dual space and depicted by a dotted line. We see that five propagators are connected to integration point five, which is one to many to cancel the conformal weight coming from the transformation of the measure under a conformal inversion. This extra weight is precisely canceled by the presence of the numerator.</p>

				<p>, together with their dual pictures.</p>

				<p>At four loops, the number of pseudo-conformal integrals contributing to the amplitude increases compared to three loops, and one finds eight of them [40]. They are shown in Figs. 17,18, along with their dual conformal pictures. Let us comment that the integrals shown in Fig. 17 were predicted by the rung rule [39], whereas the integrals shown in Fig. 18 cannot be obtained from it. The rung rule came from the observation that when constructing (n + 1)-loop integrals from n-loop integrals by the unitarity method, the two-particle cuts have an iterative structure, and (n + 1)-loop integrals can be obtained by adding a &apos;rung&apos; to n-loop integrals in all possible ways. (see also [167]). It is also interesting to note that in the calculation of [40], two integrals that one might (naively) call pseudo-conformal came with coefficient zero, i.e. they did not appear. A possible explanation for this was found in [83], where it was shown that those latter integrals are not finite in four dimensions for off-shell gluons. It is striking that of all 10 pseudo-conformal integrals, the two integrals that did not appear are both ill-defined in this sense.</p>

				<p>Based on the &apos;conformal hypothesis&apos;, i.e. that the expectation that the amplitude should be given by a linear combination of pseudo-conformal integrals, an amplitude in terms of integrals was conjectured at five loops [78]. Strikingly, it was found from unitarity cuts that integrals that are ill-defined in the sense discussed in the previous paragraph are absent in the five-gluon amplitude.</p>

				<p>We remark that, compared to a generic gauge theory, such as for example QCD, the number of integrals appearing in the final expression for the amplitudes is very small. It seems to be a special property of N = 4 SYM that the amplitudes can be reduced to such a small set of integrals. In particular, in calculations done so far, it was observed that no diagrams (representing integrals) with triangle or bubble subgraphs appear 17 If true in general, this seems to be a special feature of N = 4 SYM. We remark that if one demands or conjectures that the amplitude should be built from pseudo-conformal integrals only, then triangle and bubble subgraphs are automatically excluded.</p>

				<p>Based on [77, 40], in [83] it was conjectured that the four-gluon amplitude is a sum over 17 In the four-loop computation [40] this was used as an assumption.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The ǫ expansion of individual integrals at a given loop order l typically contains divergences up to ǫ −2l . This means that the coefficients in (134) have to be such that when one takes the logarithm , the leading divergences cancel, and at most double poles remain. This relates integrals appearing at different loop orders. A practical problem is that in order to use this relation, one has to be able to extract divergences of integrals. It would be highly desirable to have an efficient way of determining at least the leading singularities of a given integral in order to fix some of the relative coefficients (c.f. [168, 169, 167] for related work).</p>

				<p>Recall that Γ cusp , the coefficient of the double pole, is predicted from a (conjectured) integrable model [30].

				<p>We studied four-gluon scattering amplitudes. For more than four gluons, one can also define the notion of pseudo-conformal integrals, and the integrals appearing in five-and six-gluon MHV scattering amplitudes up to two loops seem to have this property [76, 92]. This is certainly worth further study.</p>

				<p>To summarise, the discovery of this hidden structure in (four-)gluon amplitudes in N = 4 SYM is one of the results of this thesis. One can say that the &apos;conformal rule&apos; (meaning that the amplitude is constructed from a linear combination of &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; integrals only) is an improvement over the &apos;rung-rule&apos; [39], which fails starting from four loops 18 . The conformal rule works at least to four loops and possibly at five loops [78]. Will this new rule also fail at some loop order? We like to think that the &apos;conformal rule&apos; is correct to all loops. Support for this expectation comes from the duality between Wilson loops and gluon amplitudes which will be discussed in section 6. If this duality holds, then the gluon amplitudes inherit the dual conformal properties of the Wilson loops. This might explain why only &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; integrals appear in the amplitude. Moreover, it would fix (at least some of) the relative coefficients with which the integrals appear in the amplitude, since then, in addition to (135), the (logarithm of the) sum of the integrals would have to satisfy the same conformal Ward identity as the Wilson loop (see section 8).</p>

				<head n="4.1">Prescription for computing scattering amplitudes at strong coupling</head>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>[79], Alday and Maldacena proposed a way to calculate scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM at strong coupling via the AdS/CFT correspondence [81]. According to [79], gluon scattering at strong coupling is described by the scattering of open strings ending on a D-brane in</p>

					<figDesc>Figure illustrating the minimal surface, whose area A enters Eq. (139).</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>The D-brane is located at z = z IR , where z IR can be thought of as an infrared regulator. The scattering takes place at fixed angle and at large momentum, and one finds that the solution is dominated by a saddle point of the classical action (see also [170] for a similar computation in flat space).</p>

				<p>It turns out that the boundary conditions are easier to describe after changing variables to T-dual coordinates y µ , for which the boundary conditions are simply ∆y µ = 2πk µ . (137)</p>

				<p>Notice that this is precisely the relation between momenta of gluons and the dual coordinate space variables 127 from section 3.2. Importantly, after defining r = R 2 /z, one finds again an AdS 5 metric in the T-dual space,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>d˜y µ dy µ + dr 2 r 2 . (138)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>So, in summary, the computation of the gluon amplitudes in the original space was related to a computation in a dual coordinate space, which also has an AdS 5 metric. The new boundary conditions imply that one should compute a minimal 19 surface that ends on a polygon defined by the coordinates y µ (which are in turn defined by the momenta of the gluons through (137)), as shown in Fig. 19</p>

				<p>It was further pointed out [79] that the computation of the minimal surface in (139) is formally similar to the computation of a light-like Wilson loop (defined in the dual AdS 5 space with coordinates y µ ) at strong coupling. However, from the AdS (and strong coupling) point of view, one might expect the relation between gluon scattering amplitudes and Wilson loops to break down at subleading orders in 1/</p>

Therefore the action has to be regularised.

So, strictly speaking, the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations following from (142) obtained in the previous section are no longer valid. In particular, since conformal invariance is broken by the regulator, conformal arguments cannot be used to relate the solution at s = t to that of arbitrary s and t.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, one can imagine the solutions obtained in this way are still useful if one is only interested in the first few terms of the perturbative expansion in ǫ of the minimal area. Indeed, Alday and Maldacena argue that one get the accurate value of the minimal surface by plugging the unregularised solution following from (142) into the regularised action, neglecting terms of order O(ǫ). More precisely, since the divergences come from the cusps, Alday and Maldacena modify the solution near the cusps by an O(ǫ) term, and in this way they obtain the correct contribution to the finite part of (139). Since this constant is scheme-dependent, we will not be interested in it here. For a more detailed discussion, see [79] 21 . One finds [79]</p>

				<p>it was found that the dimensional regularisation procedure used in [79] has to be modified at subleading orders in 1/ √ λ. 21 See also [174] for a related discussion of regularisation prescriptions for Wilson loops at strong coupling, when using a cut-off.</p>

				<p>Together with the prescription (139), we see that (149) is in agreement with the general form of the divergences of gluon scattering amplitudes, c.f. equation (114). It also reproduces correctly the known strong-coupling value of Γ cusp ,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>As was already explained in section 3, the subleading ǫ −1 term and the constant in the finite part of (149) are scheme-dependent, and therefore we are only interested in the functional form of finite part. Most importantly, it is in agreement with the BDS ansatz for the four-gluon amplitude at strong coupling! This constitutes strong evidence that the BDS ansatz holds for the four-gluon amplitude.</p>

				<p>The following comments are in order: Extending the result (149) to n ≥ 5 points turns out to be difficult, and so far no explicit solution for the minimal surface is known. In a later paper, Alday and Maldacena found that the problem simplifies when the number of gluons n is very large. By considering a special contour they were able to relate this problem to a known spacelike contour, and found a disagreement with the BDS ansatz for n → ∞ [80]. This suggests that the BDS ansatz should break down at a certain loop level and for a certain number of gluons. Finally, note that the strong-coupling calculation of [79] is insensitive to the helicity configuration of the scattering amplitude under consideration.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Let us summarise the renormalisation properties of the Wilson loops (152). In a generic gauge theory with ultraviolet divergences, the gauge field A µ a is renormalised by multiplicative counterterms , and so is the coupling constant g. These counterterms do not depend on the contour C. Let us assume that this standard renormalisation has already been carried out and focus on the divergences inherent to the Wilson loop (152).</p>

				<p>For smooth contours, the only divergence of (152) is linear (in the cut-off) [36, 176], and proportional to the length of the contour. It can be absorbed in an overall factor,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W (C) = e −K L(C) × finite , (153)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which can be interpreted as the mass renormalisation of a test particle moving along the contour C [36, 176]. In (153), L(C) is the length of the contour C.</p>

				<p>, we choose a parametrisation of the contour with ˙ x(s) · ˙ x(s) = const, such that ˙ x(s) · ¨ x(s) = 0. Since the divergence in (155) comes from the integration near t = 0, we can write</p>

				<head n="5.1.2">Contours with cusps</head>

				<p>The situation gets more interesting when the contour C is not smooth, but contains one or several cusps, as shown in Fig. 21. In that case, UV (short-distance) divergences associated to each cusp appear [36, 178]. For example, a one-loop calculation (for gauge group SU (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>N )) gives the result W (C) = 1 − 2g 2 C F [γ cot(γ) − 1] ln L a , (157)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where L is the length of the contour, a is a short-distance cut-off, and γ is the cusp angle. C F = t a t a = (N 2 − 1)/(2N ) is the quadratic Casimir of SU (N ) in the fundamental representation.</p>

				<p>The result of [178] is that to any order in the coupling constant, the new divergences can be removed by a multiplicative renormalisation,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W R (C) = Z(γ)W (C) . (158)</trash>

					<figDesc>The divergences of W R (C) depend only locally on the contour C, through the cusp angle γ. The locality of the counterterms persists when there are several cusps with cusp angles γ i . In that case, the multiplicative renormalisation factor Z(γ 1 , . . . , γ n ) = Z(γ 1 ) · · · Z(γ n ) , (159)</figDesc>

				<p>[180, 38] a renormalisation group equation for Wilson loops with cusps was derived.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>It reads µ ∂ ∂µ + β(g R ) ∂ ∂g R + Γ cusp (γ, g R ) W R (Lµ, γ, {η} , g R ) = 0 . (160) Here g R is the renormalised coupling and Γ(γ, g R ) = lim ǫ→0 Zµ ∂ ∂µ Z −1 . (161) From (161) one can derive a renormalisation group equation for Z −1 , β(g R , ǫ) ∂ ∂g R − Γ(γ, g R , ǫ) Z −1 (γ, g R , ǫ) = 0 . (162) Its solution is Z −1 (γ, g R , ǫ) = exp g R 0 dg ′ Γ(γ, g ′ , ǫ)/β(g ′ , ǫ) . (163)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In N = 4 SYM in dimension D = 4 − 2ǫ, and when using a scheme where β(g R , ǫ) = −g R ǫ, the integral in (163) can be done explicitly,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Z(γ, g R , ǫ) = exp ∞ n=1 g 2n 2n Γ (n) (γ, ǫ) ǫ , (164)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where we expanded Γ(γ, g R , ǫ) = ∞ n=0 g 2n Γ (n) (γ, ǫ). One can define a Z-factor in analogue with the MS-scheme by requiring that Γ(γ, g R , ǫ) = Γ(γ, g R ). So we have seen that the renormalisation group equation (162) implies the exponentiation of the divergent part of the Wilson loop, and in N = 4 SYM it takes the particular simple form (164).</p>

				<p>The Wilson loops studied in this report are defined in Minkowski space, with cusp having an infinite cusp angle. These will be studied in more detail in section 5.4.</p>

				<p>We mention that additional divergences can appear if one considers instead of a closed contour C an open line.</p>

				<p>In that case one looses gauge independence, and there are logarithmic divergences associated to the endpoints [176].</p>

				<p>We also mention the interesting case of crossed contours (i.e., with self-intersections) [178, 181]. For these, there are additional divergences associated to the self-intersection. It is found that the loop with the self-intersection can mix with the product of two similar loops [178], which differ from the initial one by a different ordering of the colour indices.</p>

				<head n="5.2">Wilson loops in the AdS/CFT correspondence</head>

				<p>The study of Wilson loops in the AdS/CFT correspondence started with the paper [81] (see also [182]). There, Maldacena showed how to compute a particular kind of Wilson loop in N = 4 SYM at strong coupling, using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The Maldacena-Wilson loop is similar to (4), but comprises an additional term involving scalars,</p>

				<p>Depending on the shape of the contour, the Maldacena-Wilson loop can be invariant under a certain number of supersymmetries. For example, half of the supersymmetries are preserved if ˙ x µ = const, i.e. if the contour C is a straight line 24 . Such Wilson loops were studied in [183].</p>

				<p>In this report we will study Wilson loops with light-like contours, i.e. | ˙ x| = 0. In this case (165) reduces to the usual definition of the Wilson loop (4).

				<p>Let us first discuss the origin of the cusp singularities in the n-gonal Wilson loop W (C n ) to the lowest order in the coupling constant. According to definition (167), it is given by a double contour integral,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>To regularise the ultraviolet divergences of the integrals entering (169), we use dimensional regularisation with D = 4 − 2ǫ and ǫ &gt; 0. Also, making use of the gauge invariance of the Wilson loop (167) and for the sake of simplicity, we perform the calculation in the Feynman gauge, where the gluon propagator is given by 25</p>

					<figDesc>The divergences in (169) originate from the integration of the position of the gluon in the vicinity of a light-like cusp in the Feynman diagram shown in Fig. 22</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>(the other Feynman diagrams at one loop vanish or are finite, see section 6.3). The calculation of this diagram is straightforward [85]. Let us compute it for a gluon attached to the edges p i := x i+1,i and p i−1 := x i,i−1 , as shown in Fig. 22</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In (172) we have dropped the −i0 prescription in the gluon propagator because we are only interested in the kinematical region where all x 2 i+1,i−2 &lt; 0. Adding together the contributions of all cusps we obtain the following one-loop expression for the divergent part of W (C n ):</p>

We will discuss the general structure of divergences of light-like Wilson loops in the next section.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We have already seen at one-loop order that the divergences in W (C n ) are due to the presence of the cusps on the integration contour C n . They occur when the gluon propagator in Fig. 22 slides along the contour towards a given cusp point x i . The divergences arise when the propagator becomes singular. This happens either when a gluon propagates in the vicinity of the cusp point (short distance divergences), or when a gluon propagates along the light-like segment adjacent to the cusp point (collinear divergences). In these two regimes we encounter, respectively, a double and single pole.</p>

				<p>Going to higher orders in the coupling expansion of W (C n ), we immediately realise that the structure of divergences coming from each individual diagram becomes much more complicated. Nevertheless, the divergences originate from the same part of the &apos;phase space&apos; as at one-loop: from short distances in the vicinity of cusps and from propagation along light-like edges of the contour. The main difficulty in analysing these divergences is due to the fact that in diagrams with several gluons attached to different segments of C n various regimes could be realized simultaneously , thus enhancing the strength of poles in ǫ. This implies, in particular, that individual diagrams could generate higher order poles to W (C n ).</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>26</head>

				<p>For convenience of the presentation, the following formulae are given in the planar limit, with a = g 2 N 8π 2 . For general N , the only difference is that Γcusp and Γ in (177) depend on N as well as on a. 27 Formula (176) follows from the evolution equation (8) of [85].</p>

				<p>The simplest way to understand the form of ln Z n in (176) is to analyse the divergences of the Feynman diagrams not in the Feynman gauge, but in the axial gauge [191] defined as n · A(x) = 0 , (178) with n µ being an arbitrary vector, n 2 = 0. The reason for this is that the contribution from individual Feynman diagrams become less singular in the axial gauge and, most importantly, the potentially divergent graphs have a much simpler topology [192, 193]. 28 The axial gauge gluon propagator in the momentum representation is given by the following expression,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>D µν (k) = −i d µν (k) k 2 + i0 , d (A) µν (k) = η µν − k µ n ν + k ν n µ (kn) + k µ k ν n 2 (kn) 2 . (179) The polarisation tensor satisfies the relation η µν d (A) µν (k) = (D − 2) + k 2 n 2 (kn) 2 , (180)</trash>

					<figDesc>(to be compared with the corresponding relation in the Feynman gauge, which is g µν d (F ) µν (k) = D) from which we deduce that for k 2 = 0, it describes only the physical polarisations of the on-shell gluon. 29</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Let us consider a graph in which a gluon is attached to the i-th segment. In configuration space, the corresponding effective vertex is described by the contour integral dτ i p µ i A µ (x i − p i τ i ). In the momentum representation, the same vertex reads dτ i p µ i ˜ A µ (k) e ik(x i −p i τ i ) where the field A µ (k) describes all possible polarisations (2 longitudinal and D − 2 transverse) of the gluon with momentum k µ . Let us examine the collinear regime, when the gluon propagates along the light-like direction p µ i . The fact that the gluon momentum is collinear, k µ ∼ p µ i , implies that it propagates close to the light-cone and, therefore, has a small virtuality k 2 . Furthermore, since p µ i ˜ A µ (k) ∼ k µ ˜ A µ (k) we conclude that the contribution of the transverse polarization of the gluon is suppressed as compared to the longitudinal ones. In other words, the most singular contribution in the collinear limit comes from the longitudinal components of the gauge field A µ (k). The properties of the latter depend on the gauge, however. To see this, let us examine the form of the emission vertex in the Feynman and in the axial gauge. In the underlying Feynman integral, the gauge field A µ (k) will be replaced by the propagator D µν (k), with ν being the polarisation index at the vertex to which the gluon is attached. In this way, we find that</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>p µ i ˜ D µν (k) ∼ k µ ˜ D µν (k) = −i k µ d µν (k) k 2 + i0 = − i k 2 × k ν , Feynman gauge k 2 k ν n 2 (kn) 2 − n ν (kn) , axial gauge (181)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Since k 2 → 0 in the collinear limit, we conclude that the vertex is suppressed in the axial gauge, as compared to the Feynman gauge. This is in perfect agreement with our physical intuition – the propagation of longitudinal polarisations of a gluon with momentum k µ is suppressed for k 2 → 0. This property is rather general and it holds not only for gluons attached to the integration contour , but also for the &apos;genuine&apos; interaction vertices of the N = 4 SYM Lagrangian [192, 193]. It should not be surprising now that the collinear divergences in the light-like Wilson loop come from graphs of very special topology that we shall explain in a moment.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>28</head>

				<p>Note that the contribution of individual Feynman diagrams is gauge dependent and it is only their total sum that is gauge invariant. 29 That is the reason why the axial gauge is called physical.</p>

				<p>ln W (C n ). In the axial gauge, the vertex-type diagram (a) generates simple pole; the self-energy type diagram (b) generates double pole in ǫ; the diagram (c) with gluons attached to three and more segments is finite.</p>

				<p>Another piece of information that will be extensively used in our analysis comes from the non-Abelian exponentiation property of Wilson loops [176, 194, 195]. It follows from the combinatorial properties of the path-ordered exponential and it is not sensitive to the particular form of the Lagrangian of the underlying gauge theory. For an arbitrary integration contour C it can be formulated as follows:</p>

				<p><formula>W (C) = 1 + ∞ k=1 g 2 4π 2 k W (k) = exp ∞ k=1 g 2 4π 2 k c (k) w (k) . (182)</formula></p>

				<p>Here W (k) denote the perturbative corrections to the Wilson loop, while c (k) w (k) are given by the contribution to W (k) from &apos;webs&apos; w (k) with the &apos;maximally non-Abelian&apos; color factor c (k) .</p>

				<p>To the first few orders, k = 1, 2, 3, the maximally non-Abelian color factor takes the form c (k) = C F N k−1 , but starting from k = 4 loops it is not expressible in terms of simple Casimir operators. Naively, one can think of the &apos;webs&apos; w (k) as of Feynman diagrams with maximally interconnected gluon lines. For the precise definition of &apos;webs&apos; we refer the interested reader to [194].</p>

				<p>Let us now return to the analysis of the cusp divergences of the light-like Wilson loops and take advantage of both the axial gauge and the exponentiation (182). A characteristic feature of the &apos;webs&apos; following from their maximal non-Abelian nature is that the corresponding Feynman integrals have &apos;maximally complicated&apos; momentum loop flow, e.g. they cannot be factorised into a product of integrals. When applied to the light-like Wilson loop, this has the following remarkable consequences in the axial gauge: • the &apos;webs&apos; do not contain nested divergent subgraphs; • each web produces a double pole in ǫ at most; • the divergent contribution only comes from &apos;webs&apos; localised at the cusp points as shown in Fig. 23(a) and (b).</p>

				<p>These properties imply that the divergent part of ln W (C n ) is given by a sum over the cusp points x µ i with each cusp producing a double and single pole contribution. Moreover, the corresponding residue depend on x 2 i−1,i+1 – the only kinematical invariant that one can built out of three vectors x µ i−1 , x µ i and x µ i+1 satisfying x 2 i−1,i = x 2 i,i+1 = 0. In this way, we arrive at the known relation (176) for the divergent part of the light-like Wilson loop.</p>

				<p>Our consideration relied on the analysis of Feynman diagrams at weak coupling. It was recently shown in Refs. [82, 196, 197] that the structure of divergences of ln W (C n ) remains the same even at strong coupling.</p>

				<p>In this section we formulate and discuss the main point of this thesis – the proposed duality relation between planar MHV amplitudes, M (MHV) n , and light-like Wilson loops, W (C n ). As was already mentioned in section 3, it is known that the leading infrared (IR) divergences of gluon amplitudes are in direct equivalence with the leading ultraviolet divergences of Wilson loops.

				<head n="6.1">IR divergences and their relation to Wilson loops</head>

				<p>Infrared divergences of scattering amplitudes can be understood in terms of Wilson loops. For non-Abelian gauge theories, this property was found in [198, 199, 37]. It is known [68, 70] that the IR divergent part of planar scattering amplitudes factorises into a product of form factors, and therefore it is sufficient to understand the relationship between IR divergences of form factors and a particular kind of Wilson lines.</p>

				<p>Here, we will give a one-loop example, following to some extent [73] 30 . Let us take for simplicity a form factor of massive quarks, with on-shell momenta p</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where D µν (k) is the momentum space gluon propagator, e.g. ˜ D µν (k) = η µν /k 2 in the Feynman gauge. The divergence in (184) originates from the soft region of loop momenta, k ≪ m. In dimensional regularisation, it manifests itself as a pole in ǫ, Σ d D k/k 4 ∼ 1/(4 − D), where Σ denotes the integration region for small k. 31 In that region, we can neglect k in the numerator, and make the approximation</p>

				<p>30 I am indebted to Gregory Korchemsky for enlightening explanations, on which this section is based. 31 Note that for massless quarks, m 2 = 0, there are additional collinear divergences, which is why the leading pole is double in that case.</p>

				<p>We can interpret the integral in (186) as coming from the vertex diagram 24, with the quarkantiquark-gluon vertex replaced by the eikonal vertex</p>

				<p><formula>= p ν 1 −p 1 · k + i0 . (187)</formula></p>

				<p>Notice that the quark helicity is not modified by this eikonal vertex, and Γ α IR 1 is proportional to the tree level form factor in (183). From now on, we will drop the tree-level factor, i.e. we consider</p>

				<p>Note that from the invariance of (188) under rescalings p 1 → λ 1 p 1 and p 2 → λ 2 p 2 , one can deduce that it depends on p</p>

				<p>only. Geometrically, γ corresponds to the cusp angle formed by the momenta p 1 and p 2 in Minkowski space.</p>

				<p>Now we would like to extend the integration region from Σ to the full phase space. In doing so, the integral in (188) acquires additional, artificial ultraviolet (UV) divergences. In dimensional regularisation, the UV and IR divergences cancel, and the integral over the full phase space is zero,</p>

					<figDesc>So instead of studying the IR divergences of (189) at k ≪ m, we can equivalently study its UV divergences at k ≫ m. These UV divergences are well-understood, because they correspond to cusp divergences of Wilson loops, as we will see presently. By using the identity</figDesc>
					<trash>1 −p 1 · k + i0 = −i ∞ 0 ds 1 e is 1 (−p 1 ·k+i0) , (190) and similarly for −p 2 · k + i0, we can rewrite (189) as I = 1 2 (ig) 2 C F ∞ 0 ds 1 ∞ 0 ds 2 d D k (2π) D p µ 1 p ν 2 ˜ D µν (k)e i k·(−s 1 p 1 −s 2 p 2 +i0) = 1 2 (ig) 2 C F ∞ 0 ds 1 ∞ 0 ds 2 p µ 1 p ν 2 D µν (p 1 s 1 + p 2 s 2 ) , (191)</trash>

This means that the quarks were effectively replaced by Wilson lines along their classical trajectory.</p>

				<p>After the Fourier transform, the UV divergences of (193) come from the region where p 1 s 1 + p 2 s 2 ≪ m, i.e. from the integration region of small s 1 , s 2 . This corresponds to the situation where the gluon propagator is integrated near the cusp of the Wilson loop. Taking into account the relation between UV and IR divergences (189), we see that the IR divergences of the form factor (184) are equivalently described by the UV divergences of a cusped Wilson loop, as shown in Fig. 25 (a). The latter satisfies a renormalisation group equation [180] (see also section 5.1.2). As explained in section 5.1.2, for N = 4 SYM this RG equation implies that the divergent part of the Wilson loop (and hence that of the form factor as well) takes the form</p>

				</figure>

				<p>For an explicit two-loop calculation, see [200].</p>

				<p>We remark that since we need only the UV divergences of the Wilson loop shown in Fig. 25 (a), which arise from the integration of gluons near the cusp, we can choose a modified integration contour, as shown in Fig. 25 (b). In this way, the new Wilson loop has only the desired UV divergences, but no IR divergences.</p>

				<p>Another important remark is that the definition of the Wilson loop (193) contains an unusual mixture of momenta and coordinates. Indeed, the &apos;coordinates&apos; of the Wilson loop (193) are defined by the gluon momenta (and formally have &apos;wrong&apos; canonical dimension). The same is true for the Wilson loops that enter the duality with gluon amplitudes, as we will see in the next section. These Wilson loops &apos;live&apos; in a dual coordinate space defined by the gluon momenta.</p>

				<p>The divergent parts of the scattering amplitudes and the light-like Wilson loops are also related to each other but the relationship is more subtle since the two objects are defined in two different schemes (infrared regularisation for the amplitudes and ultraviolet regularisation for the Wilson loops), both based on dimensional regularisation. From the previous section (see also the more detailed discussion in [91]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>) we know that the leading IR divergence of the amplitude (the coefficient of the double pole ǫ −2 IR in equation (114)) coincides with the leading UV divergence of the Wilson loop (the coefficient of the double pole ǫ −2 UV in equation (176)), since both are controlled by the universal cusp anomalous dimension Γ cusp (a). One can also achieve a matching of the coefficients of the subleading simple poles corresponding to the (non-universal) collinear anomalous dimensions G(a) and Γ(a). 33 To this end one relates the parameters of the two different renormalization schemes as follows,</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Here the functions γ(a) and δ(a) are chosen in a way to compensate the mismatch between G(a) and Γ(a), without creating extra µ-dependent finite terms [91]. It should be stressed that this procedure is not analogous to comparing two different renormalisation schemes for the computation of the same divergent object. It is rather a change of variables (regularisation parameters) which allows us to compare two different objects computed in two different schemes. Another such change of variables is the identification (196) of the particle momenta with the light-like segments on the Wilson loop contour.</p>

				<p>The duality relation (195) was inspired by the prescription of Alday and Maldacena for computing gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling [79]. This prescription essentially recasts the amplitudes into light-like Wilson loops in the dual variables (196), as discussed in section 4. A priori, one would expect the strong coupling relation between gluon amplitudes and Wilson loops to receive 1/ √ λ corrections, which might spoil the relation at weak coupling [79]. Nevertheless, in [83] it was found that at one loop and for four points the Wilson loop and the gluon amplitude agree, which lead to the idea that the duality might also be true perturbatively. In [84] the duality at one loop was shown to apply to n-point amplitudes as well. These one-loop results will be reviewed in section 6.3.</p>

Recall that the contour C 4 consists of four light-like segments x µ i,i+1 , x 2 i,i+1 = 0 (with the cyclicity condition i + 4 ≡ i for the indices). Hence, the Wilson loop can only depend on the two available Lorentz invariant quantities, x 2 13 and x 2 24 . Through (196) they correspond to the Mandelstam variables s and t of the four-gluon amplitude, i.e.</p>

				<p>Comparing to the corresponding expression for the four-gluon amplitude (125) and the one-loop value of the cusp anomalous dimension (177), we see that (205) is indeed in agreement with the duality relation (195).

				<p>We remark that the one-loop Wilson loop calculations presented in the previous section did not use special properties of N = 4 SYM. Indeed, only the free gluon propagator D µν (x) entered the calculation, and hence the result in other gauge theories would have been the same.</p>

				<p>This motivates to extend the checks of the duality (195) beyond one loop, where one can see a difference between e.g. QCD and N = 4 SYM.

				<p>[86], Drummond, Korchemsky, Sokatchev and the present author carried out the two-loop computation of the Wilson loop for n = 4 points, which we will present in section 7. Technical details of this calculation can be found in appendix B, where the evaluation of each Feynman diagram is shown explicitly. In section 8 we present the results of the publication [87], where we derive all-order Ward identities for the Wilson loops (4). In section 9, we perform a calculation at six points and two loops and compare to the BDS ansatz and a recently available two loop calculation of the six-gluon MHV amplitude.</p>

				<p>to two loops. The details of the calculation can be found in the appendix.</p>

				<p>In order to compute the two-loop Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 27 we employ the technique described in detail in Refs. [158, 159, 85, 190]. Furthermore, the rectangular light-like Wilson loop under consideration has been already calculated to two loops in [85, 190] in the so-called forward limit x µ 12 = −x µ 34 , or equivalently x 2 13 = −x 2 24 , in which the contour C 4 takes the form of a rhombus.</p>

				<p>The vertex-like diagrams shown in Fig. 27(c), 27(d) and 27(f) only depend on the distance x 2 13 and hence we can take the results from [85, 190]. The Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 27(h) – 27(l) are proportional to scalar products (x 12 · x 34 ) and/or (x 23 · x 14 ) and, therefore, they vanish in the limit x µ 12 = −x µ 34 due to x 2 i,i+1 = 0. For generic forms of C 4 , these diagrams have to be calculated anew. Similarly, we also have to reexamine the contribution of diagrams shown in Figs. 27(e) and 27(g). Finally, the calculation in Ref. [85, 190] was performed within the conventional dimensional regularisation (DREG) scheme. To preserve supersymmetry, we have to use instead the dimensional reduction (DRED) scheme. The change of scheme only affects the diagrams shown in Figs. 27(c) and 27(k) which involve an internal gluon loop [16].</p>

				<p>The results of our calculation can be summarised as follows. Thanks to the non-Abelian exponentiation (182), the two-loop expression for the (unrenormalised) light-like Wilson loop can be represented as</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We do not need the explicit expressions for the integrals M 2 and M 3 since, as we will see shortly, the contributions proportional to M 2 and M 3 cancel in the sum of all diagrams (for completeness, their explicit form can be found in Appendix B.3). Note that the integrals (215) vanish in the forward limit x 2 13 = −x 2 24 .</p>

				<p>We would like to stress that the above results were obtained in the Feynman gauge. Despite the fact that the contribution of each individual Feynman diagram to the light-like Wilson loop (or equivalently, the A (α) −n −functions) is gauge-dependent, their sum is gauge-invariant.</p>

				<p>Next, we substitute the obtained expressions for the coefficient functions, Eqs. (210) – (214), into (209) and finally arrive at the following remarkably simple expression for the two-loop correction,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We verify that in the forward limit, i.e. for x 2 13 = −x 2 24 , this relation is in agreement with the previous calculations of Refs. [85, 190]. The following comments are in order.</p>

				<p>Arriving at (216) we notice that the leading UV divergent O(1/ǫ 4 ) and O(1/ǫ 3 ) terms cancel in the sum of all diagrams, in agreement with (176). According to (212), the coefficients in front of 1/ǫ 2 are given by a sum of a rational number and π 2 −term. The rational terms cancel in the sum of all diagrams. As a consequence, the residue of the double pole in ǫ of w (2) in Eq. (216) is proportional to ζ 2 . In a similar manner, the residue of w (2) at the single pole in ǫ is proportional to ζ 3 and this comes about as the result of a cancelation between various terms in (213) containing rational numbers, π 2 −terms as well as the integrals M 1 and M 2 . The most striking simplifications occur in the sum of finite O(ǫ 0 ) terms (214). We find that the integrals M 2 , M 3 , M 2 1 as well as the rational corrections and the terms proportional to π 2 and ζ 3 cancel in the sum of all diagrams leading to −</p>

				<p>We would like to stress that the two-loop expression (216) satisfies the &quot; maximal transcendentality principle &quot; in N = 4 SYM [136]. Let us assign transcendentality n to functions Li n 34 and transcendentality 1 to a single pole 1/ǫ. Then it is easy to see from (216) that the coefficient in front of 1/ǫ n (including the finite O(ǫ 0 ) term) has transcendentality equal to 4 − n. In this way, each term in the two-loop expression (216) has transcendentality 4. For the same reason, the one-loop correction to the Wilson loop, Eq. (208) has transcendentality 2. Generalising this remarkable property to higher loops in planar N = 4 SYM, we expect that the perturbative correction to the Wilson loop (167) to order O(g 2n ) should have transcendentality 2n.</p>

				<p>Notice that in our calculation of the two-loop Wilson loop we did not rely on the multicolour limit. In fact, due to the special form of the maximally non-Abelian colour factors, c (n) = C F N n−1 , relation (207) is exact for arbitrary N . As was already mentioned, these colour factors become more complicated starting from n = 4 loops, where we should expect terms subleading in N .</p>

				<p>[87], the calculation of the pentagonal Wilson loop at two loops was carried out in order to further test the duality (195). The Feynman diagrams are similar to those shown in Fig. 27. Individual diagrams can depend on ratios of the five Lorentz invariants available from five light-like distances, x 2 13 , x 2 24 , x 2 35 , x 2 41 and x 2 52 . We derived (multiple) parameter integral representations for all diagrams.

For example, one could have expected nontrivial multi-variable functions to appear in the 5-point case, such as harmonic polylogarithms.

				<p>In this section we review the derivation of all-order broken conformal Ward identities for the Wilson loops W (C n ) [86, 87].</p>

				<p>Recall that C n is a polygonal contour with n light-like edges. The decisive observation is that such contours are stable under conformal transformations. That is, the contour C ′ n , which is the image of the contour C n upon a conformal transformation, is also made of n light-like segments with new cusp points x ′ i µ obtained as the images of the old ones x µ i . This property is rather obvious for translations, rotations and dilatations, but we have to check it for special conformal transformations. Performing a conformal inversion 35 , x µ′ = x µ /x 2 , of all points belonging to the segment x µ (τ i ) = τ i x</p>

				<p>Were the Wilson loop W (C n ) well defined in D = 4 dimensional Minkowski space-time, then it would enjoy the (super)conformal invariance of the underlying N = 4 SYM theory. More precisely, in the absence of conformal anomalies we would conclude that</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W C ′ n = W (C n ) . (223)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>However, as we already pointed out in section 5.4, the light-like cusps of C n cause specific ultraviolet divergences to appear in the Wilson loop (167). For this reason we use dimensional regularisation with D = 4 − 2ǫ and ǫ &gt; 0, which breaks the conformal invariance of the action, as we will see presently. In the dimensionally regularised N = 4 SYM theory, the Wilson loop W (C n ) ≡ W n is given by a functional integral</p>

				<p>Here µ is the regularisation scale and we redefined all fields in such a way that g does not appear inside the Lagrangian L(x). This allows us to keep the canonical dimension of all fields, in particular of the gauge field A µ (x), and hence to preserve the conformal invariance of the path-ordered exponential entering the functional integral in (224). However, due to the change of dimension of the measure d D x in (225) the action S ǫ is not invariant under dilatations and conformal boosts, which yields an anomalous contribution to the Ward identities.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="8.1">Anomalous conformal Ward identities</head>

				<p>The conformal Ward identities for the light-like Wilson loop W (C n ) can be derived following the standard method [202, 134, 98], by acting on both sides of (225) with generators of conformal transformations.. The expressions of the generators of conformal transformations acting on fields are given in equation (17).</p>

				<p>Let us start with the dilatations and perform a change of variables in the functional integral (224), φ ′ I (x) = φ I (x) + ε Dφ I (x). This change of variables could be compensated by a coordinate transformation x µ′ = (1 − ε)x µ . We recall that the path-ordered exponential is invariant under dilatations, whereas the Lagrangian is covariant with canonical weight ∆ L = 4. However, the measure d D x with D = 4 − 2ǫ does not match the weight of the Lagrangian, which results in a non-vanishing variation of the action S ǫ ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>δ D S ǫ = 2ǫ g 2 µ 2ǫ d D x L(x) . (226)</trash>

				<p>This variation generates an operator insertion into the expectation value, δ D S ǫ W n , and yields an anomalous term in the action of the dilatation generator on W n , i.e.,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In a similar manner, the anomalous special conformal (or conformal boost) Ward identity is derived by performing transformations generated by the operator K ν , Eq. (17), on both sides of (224). In this case the nonvanishing variation of the action δ K µ S ǫ again comes from the mismatch of the conformal weights of the Lagrangian and of the measure d D x. 36 This amounts to considering just the ∆ φ term in (17) with ∆ φ = ∆ L − D = 2ǫ, and hence</p>

				</figure>

				<p>To make use of these relations we have to evaluate the ratio L(x)W n /W n obtained by inserting the Lagrangian into the Wilson loop expectation value. Due to the presence of ǫ on the right-hand side of (229), it is sufficient to know its divergent part only.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="8.2">Dilatation Ward identity</head>

				<p>As we will now show, the dilatation Ward identity can be derived by dimensional arguments and this provides a consistency condition for the right-hand side of (229). By definition (224), the dimensionally regularised light-like Wilson loop W n is a dimensionless scalar function of the cusp points x ν i and, as a consequence, it satisfies the relation n i=1 (x i · ∂ i ) − µ ∂ ∂µ lnW n = 0 .

				</figure>

				<p>where the last relation follows from (224). Recall that according to (175), the Wilson loop W n can be split into the product of divergent and finite parts ln W n = Z n + F n . (232)</p>

				<p>Notice that the definition of the divergent part is ambiguous as one can always add to Z n a term finite for ǫ → 0. Our definition (176) is similar to the conventional MS scheme with the only difference that we choose the expansion parameter to be aµ 2ǫ instead of a. The reason for this is that Z n satisfies, in our scheme, the same relation µ∂ µ Z n = 2ǫg 2 ∂ g 2 Z n as W n , see (231). Together with (232) and (230), this implies that the finite part of the Wilson loop does not depend on the renormalisation scale, i.e.</p>

				<p>Another source of non-invariance of the action Sǫ is the gauge-fixing term (and the associated ghost term of the non-Abelian theory) which is not conformally invariant even in four dimensions. However, due to gauge invariance of the Wilson loop, such anomalous terms do not appear on the right-hand side of (228). 37 In what follows, we shall systematically neglect corrections to Fn vanishing as ǫ → 0.</p>

				<head n="8.3">One-loop calculation of the anomaly</head>

				<p>The derivation of the dilatation Ward identity (234) relied on the known structure of cusp singularities (176) of the light-like Wilson loop and did not require a detailed knowledge of the properties of Lagrangian insertion L(x)W n /W n . This is not the case anymore for the special conformal Ward identity.</p>

				<p>To start with, let us perform an explicit one-loop computation of L(x)W n /W n . To the lowest order in the coupling, we substitute W n = 1 + O(g 2 ) in the denominator and retain inside L(x) and W n terms quadratic in gauge field only. The result is</p>

				<p>The Wick contractions between gauge fields coming from the Lagrangian and the path-ordered exponential yield a product of two gluon propagators (170), each connecting the point x with an arbitrary point y on the integration contour C n .

To the lowest order in the coupling constant, the right-hand side of (236) receives non-vanishing contributions from Feynman diagrams of three different topologies shown in Figs. 28(a) – (c).</p>

				<p>As was already mentioned, the right-hand sides of the Ward identities (239) are different from zero due to the fact that the light-like Wilson loop has cusp singularities.</p>

				<head n="8.4">Structure of the anomaly to all loops</head>

				<p>To extend the analysis of the special conformal Ward identity to all loops we examine the allloop structure of divergences of L(x)W n /W n . They arise in a very similar way to those of the Wilson loop itself, which were discussed in section 5.4.2.</p>

This generates new interaction vertices inside Feynman diagrams for W n J , but does not affect the non-Abelian exponentiation property (182). 39 The only difference compared to (182) is that the webs w (k) now depend on J(x) through a new interaction vertex.

				<p>) to all loops. The following comments are in order.</p>

				<p>In Eq. (243), the term proportional to δ (D) (x − x i ) comes from the double pole contribution to the web w (k) , which is indeed located at short distances in the vicinity of the cusp x µ i . The residue of the simple pole in the right-hand side of (243) is given by the cusp anomalous dimension . This can be shown by substituting (243) into the dilatation Ward identity (227) and comparing with (235).</p>

				<p>The contact nature of the leading singularity in (243) can also be understood in the following way. The correlator on the left-hand side can be viewed as a conformal (n + 1)-point function with the Lagrangian at one point and the rest corresponding to the cusps. In the N = 4 SYM theory the Lagrangian belongs to the protected stress-tensor multiplet, therefore it has a fixed conformal dimension four. The Wilson loop itself, if it were not divergent, would be conformally invariant. This means that the n cusp points can be regarded as having vanishing conformal weights. Of course, the presence of divergences might make the conformal properties anomalous. However, the conformal behaviour of the leading singularity in (243) cannot be corrected by an anomaly. 40 Then we can argue that the only function of space-time points, which has conformal weight four at one point and zero at all other points, is the linear combination of delta functions appearing in (243). 41</p>

				<p>As was already emphasised, the residue of the simple pole of δw (k) /δJ(x) at the cusp point x i depends on its position and at most on its two nearest neighbours x i−1 and x i+1 , as well as on the insertion point. It gives rise to a function Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ), which is the same for all cusp points due to the cyclic symmetry of the Wilson loop.</p>

				<p>Notice that in (243) we have chosen to separate the terms with the collinear anomalous dimension Γ (l) from the rest of the finite terms. This choice has implications for the function Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ). Substituting the known factor Z n (176) and the particular form of (243)</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>39</head>

				<p>We recall that the non-Abelian exponentiation is not sensitive to the form of the action. 40 Such an anomalous contribution should come from a 1/ǫ 3 pole in the correlator with two insertions of the Lagrangian, but repeated use of the argument above shows that the order of the poles does not increase with the number of insertions. 41 The mismatch of the conformal weight four of the Lagrangian and D = 4 − 2ǫ of the delta functions does not affect the leading singularity in (243).</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>into the dilatation Ward identity (227), we derive n i=1 d D x Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) = 0 . (244)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We can argue that in fact each term in this sum vanishes. Indeed, each term in the sum is a Poincaré invariant dimensionless function of three points x i−1 , x i and x i+1 . Given the lightlike separation of the neighbouring points, the only available invariant is x 2 i−1,i+1 . Further, Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) cannot depend on the regularisation scale because µ always comes in the combination aµ 2ǫ and thus contributes to the O(ǫ) terms in (243). The dimensionless Poincaré invariant d D x Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) depends on a single scale and, therefore, it must be a constant, after which (244) implies d D x Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) = 0 .

				</figure>

				<p>Next, we substitute ln W n = Z n + F n into (246), replace ln Z n by its explicit form (176) and expand the right-hand side in powers of ǫ to rewrite (246) as follows:</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Note that the quantities Υ ν (x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) are translation invariant. Indeed, a translation under the integral in (247) only affects the factor x ν (the functions Υ (l) (x; x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) are translation invariant), but the result vanishes as a consequence of (245). Furthermore, Υ ν (x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) only depends on two neighbouring light-like vectors x µ i−1,i and x µ i,i+1 , from which we can form only one non-vanishing Poincaré invariant, x 2 i−1,i+1 . We have already argued that Υ (l) are independent of µ, and so must be Υ ν . Taking into account the scaling dimension one of Υ ν , we conclude that Υ ν (x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) = αx ν i−1,i + βx ν i,i+1 , (249) where α, β only depend on the coupling. The symmetry of the Wilson loop W n under mirror exchange of the cusp points translates into symmetry of (249) under exchange of the neighbours x i−1 and x i+1 of the cusp point x i , which reduces (249) to Υ ν (x i−1 , x i , x i+1 ) = α (x</p>

				<p>The reason why the functional form of F 4 and F 5 is fixed up to an additive constant is that there are no conformal invariants one can build from four or five points x i with light-like separations x 2 i,i+1 = 0. Such invariants take the form of cross-ratios</p>

				<head n="9">Hexagon Wilson loop and six-gluon MHV amplitude</head>

				<p>In section 7 we saw that the duality (5) is valid at two loops for n = 4, 5 points (or gluons). For n = 4, 5, the Ward identities derived in section 8 for the Wilson loops provide a possible explanation of the duality to all orders in the coupling constant, assuming the BDS ansatz is correct in these cases. This speculation receives support from strong coupling, where the result of [79] is in agreement with the BDS ansatz for n = 4.</p>

				<p>Recall that the authors of [80] found a disagreement with the BDS ansatz at strong coupling for the number of gluons n very large. Given this result it seems natural to ask whether the ansatz already breaks down at some perturbative level and for a finite number of gluons. If we assume the duality with Wilson loops, then n = 4 and n = 5 are completely fixed by conformal symmetry. In fact, one might even suspect that the observed validity of the duality relation for n = 4, 5 is true only because both objects have the same conformal symmetry. To put it differently, the proposed duality might be reduced to the weaker (but still highly non-trivial) statement that the MHV gluon amplitudes are governed by dual conformal symmetry. The first real test of the stronger form of the duality (5) is provided by the case n = 6. In order to distinguish between these possibilities we performed a two-loop calculation of the hexagonal Wilson loop. 42</p>

				<p>These variables are invariant under conformal transformations of the coordinates x µ i , and therefore they are annihilated by the conformal boost operator entering the left-hand side of (252). In addition, the Wilson loop W (C 6 ) is invariant under cyclic (x i → x i+1 ) and mirror (x i → x 6−i ) permutations of the cusp points [87]. This implies that R(u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) is a totally symmetric function of three variables.</p>

				<p>The one-loop Wilson loop calculation of [84] has shown that the &apos;remainder&apos; function R 6 is just a constant at one loop, which is a confirmation of the Wilson loop/scattering amplitude duality going beyond the scope of conformal symmetry. However, one might suspect just a low loop-order &apos;accident&apos;. The point is that the function R 6 must satisfy a further, rather powerful constraint, coming from the collinear limit of gluon amplitudes [52, 56]. It could be that due to the limited choice of loop integrals at this low perturbative level, the function (269) made of them is the only one satisfying both the conformal Ward identity (252) and the collinear limit.</p>

				<p>If so, at some higher perturbative level new functions with these properties might appear which could spoil the BDS ansatz and/or the Wilson loop/scattering amplitude duality.</p>

				<p>Combining together (195) and (268), we conclude that were the BDS conjecture and the duality relation (195) correct for n = 6, we would expect that R(u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) = const. The explicit two-loop calculation we report on here shows that this is not true.</p>

				<p>For the sake of simplicity we performed the calculation of W (C 6 ) in the Feynman gauge. In addition, we made use of the non-Abelian exponentiation property of Wilson loops [176, 194, 195] to reduce the number of relevant Feynman diagrams. In application to R(u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) this property can be formulated as follows (the same property also holds for F</p>

We should take into account, however, that in D = 4 dimensions there exists a relationship between the distances (273), such that only eight of them are independent. This relation reflects the fact that the five four-dimensional vectors p µ i = x µ i+1 − x µ i (with i = 1, . . . , 5) are linearly dependent, and hence their Gram determinant vanishes G[K] = det (p i · p j ) = 0 , (i, j = 1, . . . , 5) .

As was already mentioned, the relation (268) is consistent with the collinear limit of the six-gluon amplitude provided that, in the limit (284), the function R(u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) approaches a finite value independent of the kinematical invariants. The same property can be expressed as follows (we recall that the function R(u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) is totally symmetric) R(0, u, 1 − u) = c , (285) with c being a constant. Using our two-loop results for the finite part F 6 , we performed thorough numerical tests of the relation (285) for different kinematical configurations of the contour C 6 .</p>

The crucial test then was to compare the results of our Wilson loop calculation with a parallel two-loop six-gluon amplitude calculation, in order to check whether the proposed duality between Wilson loops and gluon amplitudes continues to hold at this level (which, if true, automatically implies the breakdown of the BDS ansatz). The results of the six-gluon calculation have become available very recently [92], and we present the comparison in section 9.4.</p>

				<p>Among the six configurations in equation (290) only the first four verify the Gram determinant condition 274. Also, the configurations K (0) and K (1) are related to each other by a conformal transformation. This explains why the first entry in the third column of Table 2 is almost zero, and also reflects the high precision of the numerical evaluation for the Wilson loop. Comparing the numerical values for the six-gluon amplitude and the hexagon Wilson loop, we observe that their finite parts coincide within the error bars. Therefore, we conclude that the duality relation (195) is satisfied to two loops at least. We consider this very strong evidence that the duality should hold to all orders in the coupling, although the &apos;remainder&apos; function R n is likely to receive corrections at each loop order.</p>

				<head n="10">Conclusions and outlook</head>

				<p>In this report, we studied a new duality between Wilson loops and gluon amplitudes. The latter was motivated mainly by work of Alday and Maldacena, which showed that there is a relation between gluon amplitudes and Wilson loops at strong coupling, using the AdS/CFT correspondence . Unexpectedly, the duality seems to hold also at weak coupling. Previous studies of the duality were restricted to one loop. In this thesis we computed the expectation value of the rectangular and pentagonal Wilson loops at two loops. A comparison with the corresponding MHV gluon amplitudes shows that the duality holds.</p>

				<p>As was emphasised in this report, broken (dual) conformal symmetry plays an important role on both sides of the duality. We showed that the integrals contributing to the loop corrections of the four-gluon amplitude up to four loops are all &apos;pseudo-conformal&apos; in the sense explained in section 3.2. The origin of the dual conformal symmetry for gluon amplitudes remains puzzling. For the Wilson loops, however, it is completely understood and controlled by an all-orders Ward identity, which we derived in this thesis.</p>

				<p>The case n = 6 provides a test of the duality relation beyond (dual) conformal symmetry. What makes the hexagonal Wilson loops and the six-gluon MHV amplitude agree? It seems natural to conjecture that (dual) conformal symmetry is part of a larger symmetry group, which is yet to be discovered. Such a speculation is further supported by the fact that both Wilson loops and gluon amplitudes are intimately related to the cusp anomalous relation, which in turn is governed by integrability.</p>

				<p>The results obtained give strong support for the duality between Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM. In our opinion, given the evidence presented here, it is likely that the duality is true to all orders in the coupling constant, and for an arbitrary number of points/gluons. This duality gives rise to several intriguing possibilities.</p>

				<p>The calculation of the pole part of the n-cusp Wilson loop in [87] was carried out analytically for arbitrary n at two loops, in agreement with the general formula (176). As explained in [87], one can define &apos;auxiliary&apos; diagrams to subtract the pole terms, thereby providing a definition of the finite part of the two-loop n-cusp Wilson loop in terms of a set of finite parametric integrals . We studied the latter numerically in the n = 5, 6 case, as discussed in this report, and a generalisation to n &gt; 6 should not be difficult.</p>

				<p>It would be very interesting if the arguments of Alday and Maldacena that related gluon scattering amplitudes and Wilson loops at strong coupling could be extended to arbitrary values of the coupling constant. This would constitute a proof of the duality via the AdS/CFT correspondence, or conversely, such a derivation would be an impressive test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</p>

				<p>So far, the duality is limited to maximally helicity violating (MHV) amplitudes. It is natural to wonder whether or how the duality extends to amplitudes with different helicity configurations , as for example NMHV. An obvious question is then how to match the helicity structure of the NMHV amplitudes to the Wilson loops, which are helicity independent. One may speculate that there could exist suitable modifications of the Wilson loops such that they match those amplitudes. For example, one could consider Wilson loops with local operator insertions.</p>

				<p>A related question is what the dual conformal properties of NMHV amplitudes are. This will be the subject of a forthcoming paper together with J. Drummond, G. Korchemsky and E.</p>

				<p>Soktachev.</p>

				<p>Another interesting possibility, in our opinion, would be to consider a different point of the moduli space of N = 4 SYM, such that some particles become massive. One can ask the question whether scattering amplitudes of massive on-shell gluons are still dual to the corresponding Wilson loops, whose sides are no longer light-like (because of the mass). On the other hand, for finite masses the conformal symmetry that was important in our analysis would be lost for such a configuration.</p>

				<p>In this section we show how the above identity between the off shell triple box and tennis court integrals derived in section 2.6 can also be obtained by means of the method of Mellin–Barnes (MB) representation.</p>

				<head>A.1 Introduction to the Mellin–Barnes technique</head>

				<p>This method is one of the most powerful methods of evaluating individual Feynman integrals. It is especially successful for evaluating four-point Feynman integrals. For massless off-shell four-point integrals, first results were obtained by means of MB representation in [143, 144].</p>

				<p>In the context of dimensional regularisation, with the space-time dimension d = 4 − 2ǫ as a regularisation parameter, two alternative strategies for resolving the structure of singularities in ǫ were suggested in [203, 204] where first results on evaluating four-point on-shell massless Feynman integrals were obtained. Then these strategies were successfully applied to evaluate massless on-shell double [203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209] and triple [210, 211, 39] boxes, with results written in terms of harmonic polylogarithms [212], double boxes with one leg off shell [213, 214] and massive on-shell double boxes [215, 216, 217, 218] (see also chapter 5 of [219]).

The integration in (291) goes along a straight line parallel to the imaginary axis, with −Re(λ) &lt; β &lt; 0, so that the poles of Γ(λ + z) lie on its left and those of Γ(−z) on its right, as shown in Fig. 32. Formula (291) is easy to understand. If Y &lt; X, we can close the integration contour on the right. By the residue theorem, we will pick up contributions from the poles of Γ(</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The right-hand side of (292) is indeed the series expansion of (X + Y ) −λ for Y &lt; X. However equation (291) is also valid for X &lt; Y , which can be seen by closing the integration contour on the left.</p>

				<p>The first step of the method is the derivation of an appropriate MB representation. It is very desirable to do this for general powers of the propagators (indices) and irreducible numerators. On the one hand, this provides crucial checks of a given MB representation using simple partial cases. (For example, one can shrink either horizontal or vertical lines to points, i.e. set the corresponding indices to zero, and obtain simple diagrams quite often expressed in terms of gamma functions.) On the other hand, such a general derivation provides unambiguous prescriptions for choosing integration contours (see details in [219]).</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>A.2 Example: One-loop integral</head>

				<p>As an example, let us come back to the one-loop integral Φ (1) . Using the relation to the threepoint integral (73) it is straightforward to obtain the following parameter integral representation:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ (1) (u, v) = (2πi) −2 1 0 dβ 1 dβ 2 dβ 3 δ(1 − β 1 − β 2 − β 3 ) β 1 β 2 u + β 2 β 3 v + β 1 β 3 , (293) or, after a change of variables, Φ (1) (u, v) = (2πi) −2 1 0 dx 1 0 dλ λ λ(xu + ¯ xv) + ¯ λx¯ x , (294) where ¯ x = 1 − x and ¯ λ = 1 − λ. Then, one uses the Mellin Barnes formula (291) twice in order to factorise the denominator in (293), i.e. 1 a + b + c = i∞ −i∞ dz 1 i∞ −i∞ dz 2 Γ(−z 1 )Γ(−z 2 )Γ(1 + z 1 + z 2 )a z 1 b z 2 c (−1−z 1 −z 2 ) . (295)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>As usual, the integration contours are straight vertical lines, and they are chosen between the poles of the Γ functions, i.e.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Re(z 1 ) &lt; 0 , Re(z 2 ) &lt; 0 , Re(z 1 ) + Re(z 2 ) &gt; −1 , (296) so one could choose Re(z 1 ) = −0.2 and Re(z 2</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) = −0.4 for example. The integration over the parametric integrals is now straightforward, and we obtain the MB representation [143] (see also [219]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>) Φ (1) (u, v) = (2πi) −2 i∞ −i∞ dz 1 i∞ −i∞ dz 2 u z 1 v z 2 Γ 2 (−z 1 )Γ 2 (−z 2 )Γ 2 (1 + z 1 + z 2 ) . (297)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>For 0 &lt; u, v &lt; 1 one can close the integration contours in (297) on the right and use the residue theorem to compute the integrals. This yields the result as a series expansion in u and v.</p>

				<p>The representation (297) is also useful for studying the limiting behaviour of Φ (1) . As an example, consider the OPE limit x 12 → 0, i.e. u → 0, cf. (77). Since Re(z 1 ) &lt; 0 the limit cannot be taken naively in the integrand of (297). Therefore, we deform the contour such that 0 &lt; Re(z 1 ) &lt; 1. In doing so, we cross a pole at u = 0 and hence pick up a contribution from the residue of u z 1 Γ 2 (−z 1 )Γ 2 (1 + z 1 + z 2 ). Neglecting terms that vanish as u → 0, we obtain</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ (1) (u, v) = − (2πi) −1 ln (u) i∞ −i∞ v z 2 Γ 2 (−z 2 )Γ 2 (1 + z 2 )dz 2 − (2πi) −1 i∞ −i∞ v z 2 Γ 2 (−z 2 )Γ 2 (1 + z 2 ) [Ψ(1 + z 2 ) + γ E ] dz 2 + O(u) . (298)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the second line γ E is the Euler constant and for integer v the expression Ψ(1 + v) + γ E is equal to an harmonic sum S v = v n=1 1/n. Computing the integrals in (298) by closing the contour on the right we pick up residues from v = 0, 1, . . .</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The resulting series can be summed. The first is just a geometrical series, and the second one can be done as well (e.g.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>using Mathematica). We obtain Φ (1) (u, v) = 1 1 − v ln (u) ln(v) − 2 ln(v) ln(1 − u) + π 2 3 − 2Li 2 (v) + O(u) , (301) or equivalently (still for 0 &lt; v &lt; 1), Φ (1) (u, v) = 1 1 − v [ln (u) ln(v) + 2Li 2 (1 − v)] + O(u) , (302)</trash>

				<p>Due to non-Abelian exponentiation, we only need the diagrams containing then non-Abelian colour factor ∼ C F N c . The two-loop correction w (2) is given by a sum over the individual diagrams shown in Fig. 27 plus crossing symmetric diagrams. It is convenient to expand their contributions in powers of 1/ǫ and separate the UV divergent and finite parts as follows</p>

Making use of (307), we can parameterise the contribution of each individual diagram to the Wilson loop by the set of coefficient functions A (α) −n .</p>

				<head>B.4 Identities for polylogarithms of related arguments</head>

				<p>Most (or all) of the following polylogarithm identities can be found in Lewin&apos;s book [221]. They can be easily proved by differentiating (the integration constant can be fixed by evaluating the identity for a particular value of z).</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Li 2 (−z) + Li 2 − 1 z = − 1 2 ln 2 (z) − π 2 6 , z &gt; 0 . (381) Li 2 (z) + Li 2 (1 − z) = −ln(z)ln(1 − z) + π 2 6 , 0 &lt; z &lt; 1 . (382) It follows from (382), by putting z → 1/(1 + z), Li 2 1 1 + z + Li 2 z 1 + z = −ln 1 1 + z ln z 1 + z + π 2 6 , z &gt; 0 . (383) Similar useful identities are Li 2 (1 − z) + Li 2 1 − 1 z = − 1 2 ln 2 (z) , z &gt; 0 . (384) and Li 2 (−z) + Li 2 z 1 + z = − 1 2 ln 2 (1 + z) , z &gt; 0 . (385) Using (381),(383) and (385) the functions Li 2 − 1 z , Li 2 1 1+z , Li 2 z 1+z can all be reexpressed in terms of Li 2 (−z) and logarithms. The inversion identity for Li 3 reads Li 3 (−z) − Li 3 − 1 z = − π 2 6 ln(z) − 1 6 ln 3 (z) , z &gt; 0 . (386) There is also Li 3 (−z) + Li 3 1 1 + z + Li 3 z 1 + z − ζ 3 = 1 3 ln 3 (1 + z) − 1 2 ln(z)ln 2 (1 + z) − π 2 6 ln(1 + z) , z &gt; 0 . (387)</trash>
