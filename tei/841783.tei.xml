				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>In this paper we extend the Noether theorem beyond the class of variational dynamics .</p>

				<p>The classical field theory is completely defined by equations of motion . While the least action principle is not vital at classical level , it provides a number of useful tools for studying classical dynamics . In particular , given an action functional enjoying infinites - imal symmetries , one can derive conserved currents . For non - variational equations , the infinitesimal symmetries do not necessarily result in the conservation laws and vice versa . All the symmetries are divided into gauge and rigid . The gauge symmetries are unambigu - ously connected to Noether &apos; s identities ( also called the strong conservation laws ) as far as equations are variational . If the equations do not come from the least action principle , this relationship ( sometimes called the second Noether theorem ) is generally invalid : It is possible to have gauge invariant field equations without Noether &apos; s identities or equations possessing strong conservation laws without being gauge invariant .</p>

				<p>In the gauge field theory , the existence of action is a key prerequisite for constructing the standard BRST theory either in the Hamiltonian BFV form [ 1 ] or in the BV field - anti - field formalism [ 2 ] ( see [ 3 ] for review ) . The BRST theory , in its turn , provides the most general tools for quantizing gauge theories [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Also , the BRST formalism serves for the study of various classical problems such as constructing consistent interactions in gauge models [ 4 ] or identifying the nontrivial conservation laws and rigid symmetries [ 5 ] .</p>

				<p>Now , it is known [ 6 ] that the BRST theory can be extended beyond the class of dynam - ical systems whose equations of motion are variational . Classically , the BRST complex can always be constructed for any regular system of field equations , variational or not [ 3 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . The quantization , however , requires an extra ingredient , besides the field equa - tions . In the framework of the deformation quantization it is the weak Poisson structure [ 6 ] ( see also [ 8 ] ) . The existence of the weak Poisson structure is much less restrictive for the evolutionary equations than the requirement to be Hamiltonian . In the framework of the path - integral quantization , the corresponding extra ingredient was first introduced in [ 7 ] and called the Lagrange structure . Again , the existence of the Lagrange structure is much less restrictive for the equations than the requirement to be variational or admit an equivalent variational reformulation . Whenever the Lagrange structure is known for a given system of equations , the theory can be consistently quantized in three equivalent ways . First , the original non - Lagrangian field theory in d dimensions can be converted into equivalent Lagrangian topological field theory in d + 1 . The latter can be then quantized by the usual BV procedure [ 7 ] . Second , the generating functional of Green &apos; s functions can be defined through the generalized Schwinger - Dyson equation [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . Third , the original non - Lagrangian field theory can be embedded into an augmented Lagrangian theory in the same d dimensions [ 11 ] .</p>

				<p>Besides providing the basis for quantizing non - Lagrangian field theories , the Lagrange structure binds together gauge symmetries and the strong conservation laws , although the relationship is more relaxed than for the variational case [ 7 ] . In the first - order formalism , for example , the constraints and gauge symmetries remain fully unrelated [ 12 ] unless the equations are Hamiltonian . A certain correlation is set up by the weak Poisson structure , although it is not so rigid as the relation between the first - class constraints and gauge symmetries in the Hamiltonian constrained dynamics .</p>

				<p>In this paper we will show that the Lagrange structure allows one to connect the rigid symmetries with the conservation laws . This relationship reveals itself in a different way than the link between the gauge symmetries and the strong conservation laws in non - Lagrangian theories equipped with the Lagrange structure . In the next sections we give accurate definitions for symmetries , identities and conservation laws and , by making use of the Lagrange structure , establish a relationship between them . The general construc - tion is then exemplified by a class of non - Lagrangian models , where some fundamental symmetries and / or conserved currents can be explicitly found and compared .</p>

				<p>To give a preliminary impression of the connection between the symmetries and con - servation laws , below in the Introduction , we reformulate the standard Noether theorem in the way that illuminates the points which are important for extending the theorem beyond the class of Lagrangian dynamics .</p>

				<p>Let M denote the configuration space of fields ϕ i . Hereinafter we use De Witt &apos; s con - densed notation [ 17 ] whereby the index i , labelling the fields , includes also the space - time coordinates {x µ } . The smooth functions f ( ϕ ) on M are identified with the local function - als of fields . In terms of the condensed notation , the Lagrangian equations of motion are given by the components of an exact 1 - form dS on M , where d = δϕ i δ δϕ i is the variational differential and S is the action functional . In general , the field equations can well be the components of a section of another bundle over M , not necessarily T * M . For example , the tensor type of equations can differ from that of fields ( see the next section ) . Here , however , we restrict our discussion to equations whose left hand sides are given by the components of a local 1 - form T = T i ( ϕ ) δϕ i on M . Then the necessary condition for the existence of an action for the field equations T i ( ϕ ) = 0 requires T to be a closed 1 - form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>dT = 0 . ( 1 . 1 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This is the well - known Helmholtz criterion from the inverse problem of the calculus of variations .</p>

				<p>Recall that a local vector field Ψ = Ψ i ( ϕ ) δ δϕ i on M is called a characteristic of the equations T i = 0 if d ( i Ψ T ) ≡ 0 , i Ψ T ≡ Ψ i T i . ( 1 . 2 )</p>

				<p>Since the value i Ψ T is annihilated by the variational derivative , it must be the integral of a total divergence ∂ µ j µ . By definition , the latter vanishes on the equations of motion , and hence j µ is a conserved current .</p>

				<p>Every vector field Ψ generates a transformation δϕ i = Ψ i ( ϕ ) of the space of fields M and we say that Ψ is a proper symmetry of the equations of motion if L Ψ T = 0 , ( 1 . 3 ) where L Ψ is the Lie derivative along Ψ . For the variational equations of motion T = dS the proper symmetries are clearly the symmetries in the usual sense . Making use of Cartan &apos; s formula L Ψ T = i Ψ ( dT ) + d ( i Ψ T ) , ( 1 . 4 ) we see that the proper symmetry Ψ is a characteristic if i Ψ ( dT ) = 0 . For the variational equations of motion , satisfying the Helmholtz condition ( 1 . 1 ) , the last formula identifies symmetries with characteristics . It is the statement which is known as the Noether theorem .</p>

				<p>Let us summarize the lessons that can be learned from the above formulation of the Noether theorem towards its extension beyond the scope of variational dynamics . The construction of characteristics from symmetries involves , besides the equations of mo - tion , one more crucial ingredient , namely , the variational exterior differential d that maps the variational p - forms to the ( p + 1 ) - forms . In the particular case discussed above , the equations of motion are given by 1 - forms . Three main properties of the differential d are relevant for establishing the link between the symmetries and conservation laws . First , the field equations are d - closed ( 1 . 1 ) . Second , the exterior differential and the Lie derivative are related to each other through Cartan &apos; s formula ( 1 . 4 ) . Third , the kernel of the varia - tional differential is constituted by the integrals of total divergencies ∂ µ j µ . These three facts taken together imply that the symmetries can be identified with the characteristics .</p>

				<p>The general field equations need not be a section of the cotangent bundle T * M . They may well be associated with another vector bundle E → M over the configuration space of fields M , in which case the differential d does not work any more . Thus , one needs a more general operator d E to replace the variational exterior differential in the case of non - Lagrangian equations of motion . The aforementioned Lagrange structure provides such an operator that satisfies the first two properties . The third one is obeyed , in a sense , only by weakly transitive Lagrange structures . Thus , whenever the non - Lagrangian field equations enjoy a weakly transitive Lagrange structure , the Noether theorem can be still formulated in full . In the intransitive case , a weaker proposition can be proved , connecting rigid symmetries with characteristics in a more relaxed way .</p>

				<head n="2">Classical fields</head>

				<p>As is well known , the geometry underlying the cinematics of local field theory is that of jet bundles . So we begin the section with recalling some basics from the jet theory relevant for our purposes . For a systematic exposition of the subject the reader may consult the books [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] .</p>

				<p>The starting point of any local field theory is a locally trivial fiber bundle π : Y → X , which base X is usually identified with the space - time manifold and which sections , i . e . , the smooth maps ϕ : X → Y satisfying p • ϕ = id X , are called fields or histories . The space of all histories ( = sections of Y ) will be denoted by M . The typical fiber of Y , being given by U ≃ π −1 ( x ) , x ∈ X , is usually referred to as the target space of fields .</p>

				<p>The r - th jet prolongation of the fiber bundle Y → X is the bundle π r : J r Y → X , whose points are r - jets . By definition , an r - jet j r x ϕ is the equivalence class of a local sec - tion ϕ of Y , where two local sections ϕ and ϕ ′ are considered to be equivalent if they have the same Taylor development of order r at x ∈ X in some ( hence any ) pair of co - ordinate charts centered at x and ϕ ( x ) . It follows from the definition that each section ϕ of Y induces the section j r ϕ of J r Y by the rule ( j r ϕ ) ( x ) = j r x ϕ . If Y is coordinatized by the numbers {x µ , u i } , where {x µ } and {u i } are local coordinates in X and U , then</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Classical dynamics on Y → X are specified by imposing differential equations . An r - th order differential equation is , by definition , a closed imbedded submanifold S ⊂ J r Y .</p>

				<p>A solution , or true history ϕ , is a section of Y satisfying j r ϕ ∈ S . The true histories form a subspace Σ in the space of all histories M . In classical field theory , the differential equa - tions are mostly defined by ( nonlinear ) differential operators associated to vector bundles . Let E → X be a vector bundle . The r - th order E - valued differential operator is a map T : M → Γ ( E ) such that the value of the section T ( ϕ ) at x ∈ X is fully determined by j r x ϕ . This definition assumes the existence of a bundle morphism Θ : J r Y → E such that T ( ϕ ) = Γ ( Θ ) • j r ( ϕ ) . The differential equation S ∈ J r Y is then identified with the pre - image of the base X ⊂ E , considered as the zero section , under the bundle map Θ . In each local coordinate chart on E ⊕ J r Y , the condition that ϕ belongs to the kernel of the map T takes the form of partial differential equations</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where {T a } are components of the section T ( ϕ ) with respect to some frame {e a } in E .</p>

				<p>Though rigor and geometrically transparent , the language of jets appears to be unduly cumbersome in developing general field - theoretical constructions where the local structure of fields , while important , is out of focus . For this reason we will use a little bit loose but much more handy notation known in the physical literature as De Witt &apos; s condensed notation [ 17 ] . According to this notation , the fields ϕ i ( x ) are treated as local coordinates on the infinite dimensional manifold M ; in so doing , the index i also includes the local coordinates {x µ } on X so that ϕ i ≡ ϕ i ( x ) . Similarly , the sections s = s a ( x ) e a of the vector bundle E → X are considered to be linear coordinates s a ≡ s a ( x ) on the infinite dimensional vector space Γ ( E ) . Then one can view the differential operator T : M → Γ ( E ) as a section of the trivial , infinite dimensional vector bundle E = M × Γ ( E ) over M . Of a particular importance for our consideration will be differential operators with values in differential forms on X , this is the case of E = ∧ • T * X . We will denote the space of all such operators by Ω • . The scalar differential operators are , by definition , the elements of the space Ω 0 . Let ν be a fixed volume form on X . By smooth functions on M we understand the local functionals of fields . These are given by integrals f [ ϕ ] = X νF ( ϕ ) ( 2 . 3 ) of scalar differential operators F evaluated for fields ϕ ∈ M of compact support . The relation between local functionals and scalar differential operators is not generally one - to - one . For example , if ∂X = ∅ and F and F ′ are two scalar operators such that ν ( F ′ −F ) = dj for some j ∈ Ω n−1 , n = dimX , then f ′ = f . We say that two local functionals f and f ′ are equivalent modulo boundary terms , f . = f ′ , if they differ by a local functional of the form X dj ( ϕ ) . By the Stokes theorem the equivalence implies that f ′ − f = ∂X j ( ϕ ) .</p>

				<p>In the sequel , for the sake of simplicity , we will assume that Y → X is a trivial vector bundle over a contractible domain in R n . Then , one has a simple criterion for the local functional f to vanish modulo boundary terms [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 15 ]</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Of course , in a topologically nontrivial situation only the &quot; if &quot; part of the criterion holds true . Following the finite dimensional pattern , we can interpret the variations df of local functionals as exact 1 - forms on M , with {δϕ i } being a local frame in T * M . The compo - nents of the 1 - form df define the Euler - Lagrange differential operator δf / δϕ i . In a similar manner , one can introduce the tangent bundle T M as the vector bundle which sections are evolutionary vector fields</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Every evolutionary vector field V generates a flow Φ V t on the space of all histories M , which is described by the evolution - type system ∂ t ϕ i = V i of PDEs , hence the name .</p>

				<p>Given a fiber bundle Y → X , the correspondence E → E is quite natural in the sense that it allows one to extend all the usual tensor operations from the finite dimensional vector bundles to the corresponding infinite dimensional ones . In particular , one can define the dual of the vector bundle E as the vector bundle E * corresponding to E * . There is a natural</p>

				<p>pairing between sections of E and E * defined by the integral</p>

				</figure>

				<p>As is seen the result of pairing is a smooth function on M . In accordance with De Witt &apos; s convention , we can write the last expression just as the sum S a T a , where the repeated index a implies also integration over X .</p>

				<p>The direct product E 1 ⊕E 2 is defined to be the bundle corresponding to E 1 ⊕E 2 . Finally , we define the tensor product E 0 ⊗ E 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ E m as the trivial vector bundle over M whose sections are differential operators</p>

				<p>Applying this construction to the cotangent bundle T * M , we define the p - th exterior power of the cotangent bundle ∧ p T * M , whose sections are p - forms on M . The operator of variational derivative mentioned above gives rise to the exterior differential d :</p>

				<p>One can view the theory of jet bundles as a &quot; differential geometry with higher deriva - tives &quot; . The advantage of the condensed notation over jets is that it brings the subject back into the more familiar geometric framework without higher derivatives at the cost of pass - ing to infinite dimensional manifolds . Of course , care must be exercised when using the standard differential - geometric constructions in the infinite dimensional setting . It is par - ticularly important to keep in mind that unlike the finite dimensional case , the space of sections Γ ( E ) is not a module over the space of smooth functions C ∞ ( M ) ( the latter con - sists of local functionals ) . Although it is possible to think of Γ ( E ) as a module over the scalar differential operators Ω 0 with respect to the pointwise multiplication of functions on X , the induced action of</p>

				<head n="3">Symmetries , identities and conservation laws</head>

				<p>The discussion of the previous section can be summarized by saying that the classical dynamics of fields are fully specified by a section T of some vector bundle E → M over the space of all histories . For this reason we call E the dynamics bundle . The subspace of true histories Σ ⊂ M is defined to be the zero locus of T ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Σ = {ϕ ∈ M| T ( ϕ ) = 0} . ( 3 . 1 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Using the physical terminology , we will refer to Σ as the shell . The field equations T ( ϕ ) = 0 are supposed to satisfy the standard regularity conditions usually assumed for PDEs , see e . g . [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] . These conditions ensure that any section S ∈</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Γ ( E ′ ) vanishing on Σ is representable in the form S = Γ ( H ) ( T ) ( 3 . 2 ) for some homomorphism H ∈ Hom ( E , E ′ ) .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The present section contains no original results , we just explain our terminology and briefly run through the notions of symmetry , identities and conservation laws , which are studied in the next sections .</p>

				<p>To begin with , we introduce the homomorphism J :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>T M → E defined by 1 J ( X ) , Ψ = X · T , Ψ ∀X ∈ Γ ( T M ) , ∀Ψ ∈ Γ ( E * ) , ( 3 . 3 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Ψ being understood as a field independent section of E * . The homomorphism J is called [ 16 ] the universal linearization of the nonlinear differential operator T . We also introduce the sign of weak equality S ≈ S ′ borrowed from Dirac &apos; s constrained dynamics . It means that two sections S and S ′ of some vector bundle over M coincide on shell , i . e . , S| Σ = S ′ | Σ .</p>

				<p>An evolutionary vector field X is said to be a symmetry of the classical system if it preserves the shell Σ . This amounts to the weak equality</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>J ( X ) ≈ 0 . ( 3 . 4 ) The symmetries form a subalgebra Sym ′ ( T ) ⊂ Γ ( T M ) in the Lie algebra of all vector fields on M . A section Ψ ∈ Γ ( E</trash>

					<figDesc>* ) is said to be an identity of the classical system if</figDesc>
					<trash>Ψ , T . = 0 . ( 3 . 5 ) As a differential consequence of the last equality we have J * ( Ψ ) ≈ 0 . ( 3 . 6 ) Denote by Id ′ ( T ) ⊂ Γ ( E</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>* ) the subspace of all identities .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>The notions of symmetry and identity can be further elaborated on . Observe that any vector field X that vanishes on the shell , i . e . , X ≈ 0 , is a symmetry in the sense of ( 3 . 4 ) . The on - shell vanishing symmetries are called trivial . They are present in any classical theory , containing no valuable information about the structure of dynamics . Fortunately , being proportional to the equations of motion , the trivial symmetries constitute an ideal Sym 0 ( T ) ⊂ Sym ′ ( T ) in the Lie algebra of all symmetries and can thus be systematically disregarded . So in what follows , by a symmetry we will actually mean an element of the factor algebra Sym ( T ) = Sym ′ ( T ) / Sym 0 ( T ) .</p>

				<p>A symmetry X ∈ Sym ( T ) is called a gauge symmetry if there exists a vector bundle F → M together with a section ε ∈ Γ ( F ) and a homomorphism R ∈ Hom ( F , T M ) such that ImR ⊂ Sym ( T ) and X = R ( ε ) . If the vector bundle F is big enough to accommodate any ( nontrivial ) gauge symmetry with a fixed R , then we refer to F as the gauge algebra bundle . Notice that J • R ≈ 0 . The homomorphism R defines an ( over ) complete basis of gauge generators . Clearly , the vector distribution ImR ⊂ T M is on - shell involutive , and hence it defines a foliation of Σ . The leaves of this foliation are called gauge orbits . Two points p , q ∈ Σ are considered to be ( gauge ) equivalent , q ∼ p , if they belong to the same gauge orbit . The quotient space Σ / ∼ is termed as a covariant phase space . It is the space of all physical states of the system .</p>

				<p>Since the gauge symmetries form an ideal GSym ( T ) ⊂ Sym ( T ) , one can define the factor algebra RSym ( T ) = Sym ( T ) / GSym ( T ) , which is naturally identified with the Lie algebra of all rigid symmetries . By definition , the rigid symmetries are transverse to the gauge orbits and thus they induce a nontrivial action on the phase space of physical states .</p>

				<p>Equation ( 3 . 5 ) admits a lot of trivial solutions that can be constructed as follows .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Take an arbitrary section of K ∈ Γ ( E * ∧ E * ) and consider it as a homomorphism from Hom ( E , E * ) . Then Ψ = K ( T ) satisfies ( 3 . 5 ) . The identities constructed in such a way are of no physical significance and , therefore , they should be regarded as trivial . Notice that each trivial identity vanishes on shell . The converse implication is also true [ 3 ]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>: Each on - shell vanishing identity has the form Ψ = K ( T ) for some skew - symmetric K . The proof exploits the regularity assumption for the equations of motion . The nontrivial identi - ties are then defined as the elements of the quotient space</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Id ( T ) = Id ′ ( T ) / Id 0 ( T ) , where Id 0 ( T ) ⊂ Id ( T ) is the subspace of trivial identities . An identity Ψ ∈ Id ( T ) is called Noether &apos; s identity if there exists a vector bundle G → M together with a section ξ ∈ Γ ( G ) and a homomorphism Z ∈ Hom ( G , E * ) such that ImZ ⊂ Id ( T ) and Ψ = Z ( ξ ) . Denote by NId ( T ) ⊂ Id ( T ) the subspace of all Noether &apos; s identities and define the quotient space Char ( T ) = Id ( T ) / NId ( T ) ,</trash>

				<p>far from being a bijection , since neither left nor right hand sides of ( 3 . 11 ) are defined by j and Ψ unambiguously . For instance , one may add to j any closed ( and hence exact ) form di without changing Ψ . The exact forms di ∈ Ω n−1 are characterized by zero charge and , therefore , one should regard them as trivial . Another source of triviality is related to the currents j that vanish on shell . Taking into account either of possibilities , we identify the space of nontrivial conservation laws CL ( T ) with the equivalence classes of on - shell closed forms j ∈ Ω n−1 . Two such forms are considered as equivalent whenever they differ by an on - shell exact form 2 :</p>

				<p>The space CL ( T ) is also known as the characteristic cohomology of Σ in form degree n − 1 , see [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and [ 25 ] .</p>

				<p>Turning to the right hand side of ( 3 . 11 ) , one can see that trivial identities give rise to trivial conservation laws . This is an additional ( in fact the main ) reason to call the on - shell vanishing identities trivial . Furthermore , the Noether identities correspond to the trivial conservation laws as well .</p>

				<p>Generally it is a rather hard problem to identify the spaces of all non - trivial symmetries and characteristics for a given set of equations . The problem , however , is considerably simplified for the ordinary differential equations in normal form , where either of spaces admits a fairly explicit description . By this reason we will use this class of dynamical systems to exemplify all the general notions and constructions throughout the paper . Without loss of generality we can restrict ourselves to the systems of first - order</p>

Considering Y ×R as a trivial fiber bundle over R , one can thought of v as a vertical vector field on Y × R .

				<p>where f is a function on Y × R and d is the exterior differential on Y . Let C ∞ v ( Y × R ) denote the space of all smooth functions satisfying equations ( 3 . 18 ) . These equations specify f up to an additive constant and each such f is conserved . Thus we are led to the following isomorphisms :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Char ( ˙ x + v ) ≃ C ∞ v ( Y × R ) / R , CL ( ˙ x + v ) ≃ C ∞ v ( Y × R ) . ( 3 . 19 ) Let us now turn to the symmetries of ( 3 . 15 ) . The general evolutionary vector field on M has the form W = dtw i ( t , x , ˙ x , . . . , ( m ) x ) δ δx i ( t ) . ( 3 . 20 )</trash>

					<figDesc>Being interested in symmetries , we can exclude all the derivatives from the integrand of ( 3 . 20 ) with the help of the equations of motion . This reduces the ansatz ( 3 . 20 ) to</figDesc>

Verifying ( 3 . 4 ) one can find that W is a symmetry iff ∂ t w = [ v , w ] . ( 3 . 22 ) Denoting by X v ( Y × R ) the space of all vertical vector fields satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) , we can write Sym ( ˙ x + v ) = X v ( Y × R ) . ( 3 . 23 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Let us suppose that the vector field v is complete . Then , considering ( 3 . 18 ) and ( 3 . 22 ) as systems of the first - order ODEs for f and w , respectively , we conclude that the spaces of conservation laws and symmetries are isomorphic to the spaces of initial data C ∞ ( Y ) and X ( Y ) . Thus the space of symmetries appears to be &quot; much larger &quot; than the spaces of characteristics and conservation laws whenever dim Y &gt; 1 .</p>

				<p>The form of equations ( 3 . 4 ) and ( 3 . 6 ) shows a certain duality between the concepts of symmetry and conservation law . The dual nature of these concepts is also supported by the celebrated Noether theorem for Lagrangian equations of motion . The long time use of this theorem has lead to a widespread belief that any conservation law or , what is the same , characteristic is a reflection of some symmetry . Beyond the scope of Lagrangian dynamics , this is not always true . Not any conservation law comes from some symmetry , nor does each symmetry correspond to a conservation law . There is no canonical relation - ship between these two concepts in general . This fact has a simple geometric explanation : The characteristics Ψ &apos; s and the symmetries X &apos; s belong to different vector bundles unless E * = T M . This suggests that ( i ) any systematic procedure for converting symmetries to characteristics and vice versa has to involve an additional geometric structure on M and ( ii ) whatever this structure may be , it will result in a linear relation between the dual of the dynamics bundle E * and the tangent bundle of M . It is then quite reasonable to start with some homomorphism V : E * → T M and to look for a suitable set of conditions ensuring that V ( Ψ ) is a symmetry whenever Ψ is a characteristic . Actually , such a homomorphism V has been already identified as a key structure needed for the path - integral quantization of non - Lagrangian gauge theories [ 7 ] . This homomorphism is called a Lagrange anchor .</p>

					<figDesc>Since the last relation is linear in V , the Lagrange anchors form a vector space , which we denote by An ′ ( T ) .

				<p>The peculiar form of the operator J allows one to absorb all the derivatives of p &apos; s into the trivial anchor ( 4 . 13 ) for an appropriate G .</p>

				<p>Using then the equations of motion or , what is the same , adding an appropriate on - shell vanishing anchor V 0 , one can also exclude all the derivatives of x &apos; s from the integrand of ( 4 . 15 ) .

				<p>Substituting the last expression to the defining condition ( 4 . 2 ) , we finally get α ij = −α ji , ∂ t α = L v α , ( 4 . 18 )</p>

If the vector field v is complete , then equation ( 4 . 18 ) defines an isomorphism An ( ˙ x + v ) ≃ Γ ( ∧ 2 T Y ) . This classification result is in agreement with the conclusions of paper [ 21 ] . In [ 21 ] , it is proven that any Lagrange anchor for the AKSZ - type sigma models [ 32 ] always reduces to a purely algebraic operator whose coefficients do not dependent on the space - time derivatives of fields .</p>

				<p>Clearly , the derivation d E defines a bundle homomorphism V : E * → T M . The shell Σ being a regularly imbedded submanifold , equation ( 5 . 2 ) is equivalent to the defining condition ( 4 . 2 ) . Thus , V is a Lagrange anchor .</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Comparing Definitions 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 with the definition of a Lie algebroid ( see e . g .

				<p>This particular yet important case accounts for the name of V – &quot; Lagrange anchor &quot; . For an integrable Lagrange structure the bracket ( 5 . 3 ) satisfies the Jacobi identity and the anchor distribution ImV ⊂ T M is integrable .</p>

				<p>To illustrate ( as well as motivate ) the definitions above let us consider a Lagrangian theory with action S ( ϕ ) . The equations of motion read T ≡ dS = 0 , ( 5 . 6 ) so that the dynamics bundle E is given by the cotangent bundle T * M of the space of all histories .

				<p>The identity d 2 = 0 means integrability . The Lagrange anchor is given by the identical map V = id : T M → T M and the Lie bracket ( 5 . 3 ) coincides with the commutator of vector fields .</p>

				<p>Definitions 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 suggest to view the Lagrange structure as a &quot; Lie algebroid with relaxed integrability condition &quot; in the sense that the &quot; strong &quot; integrability condition d 2 E = 0 is replaced here by the weaker one d 2 E T = 0 . In spite of weakened integrability , it is still possible to utilize many of the usual differential - geometric constructions associated to Lie algebroids . In particular , we can endow the exterior algebra of E - differential forms Γ ( ∧ • E ) with the operations of inner differentiation and Lie derivative .</p>

				<p>By definition , the inner differential i Ψ associated with a section Ψ ∈ Γ ( E * ) is a differ - entiation of Γ ( ∧ • E ) of degree - 1 which action on A ∈ Γ ( E ) is given by i Ψ A = Ψ , A . ( 5 . 8 )</p>

				<p>Following the analogy with Cartan &apos; s calculus , the Lie derivative along Ψ is defined now by L Ψ = i Ψ • d E + d E • i Ψ . ( 5 . 9 ) It is a differentiation of Γ ( ∧ • E ) of degree 0 . One can easily verify the following identities :</p>

					<figDesc>Given a Lagrange structure ( E , T , d E ) and a section Ψ ∈ Γ ( E * ) , the vector field V ( Ψ ) is said to be a proper symmetry generated by Ψ if L Ψ T = 0 .</figDesc>

				<p>Notice that the proper symmetry V ( Ψ ) is a symmetry in the usual sense . Indeed , L Ψ T ≈ J • V ( Ψ ) and L Ψ T = 0 implies V ( Ψ ) ∈ Sym ′ ( T ) .

				<p>We emphasize that the property of being proper symmetry is not homotopy invariant : If V ( Ψ ) is a proper symmetry and V ∼ V ′ , then V ′ ( Ψ ) may not be a symmetry at all , unless Ψ ∈ Id ′ ( T ) .</p>

In the latter case , we have a well defined Lie algebra homomorphism ( 5 . 14 ) .</figDesc>

				<head>Proof .</head>

				<p>Applying the fourth identity ( 5 . 10 ) to T and using ( 5 . 13 ) , we find that L [ Ψ , Ψ ′ ] T = 0 . Hence [ Ψ , Ψ ′ ] ∈ Γ ( E * ) is a proper symmetry generator .</p>

				<p>Applying now the third identity ( 5 . 10 ) to T , we get i [ Ψ , Ψ ′ ] T = 0 provided that Ψ , Ψ ′ ∈ Id ′ ( T ) . So the bracket of two identities is an identity again . Suppose for a moment that Ψ ′ is given by a sum of the Noether and trivial identities , i .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>e . , Ψ ′ = Z ( ξ ) + K ( T ) , for some K ∈ Γ ( E * ∧ E * ) and ξ ∈ Γ ( G ) . We have [ Ψ , Ψ ′ ] = L Ψ K ( T ) + L Ψ Z ( ξ ) = ( L Ψ K ) ( T ) + Z ( V ( Ψ ) ξ ) + ( L Ψ Z ) ( ξ ) . ( 5 . 15 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>By definition , the right hand side is an identity . Clearly , the first term is a trivial identity and the second one is a Noether identity . Then the third term , being proportional to an arbitrary section ξ , has to define a Noether identity as well . We thus conclude that the trivial and Noether identities constitute an ideal in Id ′ ( T ) with respect to the bracket multiplication .</p>

				<p>So we have a well defined bracket on the quotient space Char ( T ) .</p>

				<p>It follows from the fourth identity in ( 5 . 10 ) that</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>[ V ( Ψ ) , V ( Ψ ′ ) ] · f − V ( [ Ψ , Ψ ′ ] ) · f = W ( Ψ , Ψ ′ ) · f ∀f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) , ( 5 . 16 ) where W ( Ψ , Ψ ′ ) · f ≡ Ψ ∧ Ψ ′ , d 2 E f . ( 5 . 17 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>By construction , the vector field W ( Ψ , Ψ ′ ) is a symmetry , not necessary proper though .</p>

				<p>It vanishes for integrable Lagrange structures , when the bracket ( 5 . 3 ) enjoys the Jacobi identity . In this case , relation ( 5 . 16 ) says that V :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Γ ( E * ) → Γ ( T M ) is a Lie algebra homo - morphism . This homomorphism takes the subalgebra Id ′ ( T ) to the subalgebra PSym ′ V ( T ) .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Passing to the quotient , we get a well defined Lie algebra homomorphism ( 5 . 14 ) .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Example ( continuation ) . Besides the homomorphism V : T * M → T M , the Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) defines a bracket ( 5 . 3 ) on the cotangent bundle T * M . The latter is given by [ δx i ( t ) , δx j ( t ′ ) ] = δx k ( t ) ∂ k α ij ( t , x ( t ) ) δ ( t − t ′ ) . ( 5 . 18 ) Formulas ( 4 . 17 ) , ( 4 . 18 ) and ( 5 . 18</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) taken together define the most general Lagrange struc - ture associated to the first - order differential equations ( 3 . 15 ) .</p>

				<p>Clearly , the Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) is transitive if for any t ∈ R the bivector α t ∈ Γ ( ∧ 2 T Y ) is nondegenerate . In this case , each fiber ( Y , α t ) of Y ×R is an almost symplectic manifold . One can also check [ 7 ] that the integrability of the Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) amounts to the Jacobi identity 1 6 [ α , α ] ≡ α im ∂ m α jk ∂ i ∧ ∂ j ∧ ∂ k = 0 . ( 5 . 19 ) Here the square brackets denote the Schouten commutator of polyvector fields . In the integrable case , the bundle map α t : T * Y → T Y defines the Lie algebroid of the Poisson manifold ( Y , α t ) . If the Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) is both transitive and integrable , then ( Y , α t ) is a symplectic manifold .</p>

				<p>Suppose now that for any t ∈ R the involutive closure of the vector distribution Imα t ⊂ T Y coincides with the whole tangent bundle T M . Then the Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) , ( 4 . 18 ) is weakly transitive . The condition for the 1 - form ( 3 . 17 ) to be a proper symmetry of ( 3 . 15 ) gives i X ( dψ ) = 0 , i X ( ∂ t ψ + dψ ( v ) ) = 0 ( 5 . 20 ) for any vertical vector field X = α ( w ) , with w being a 1 - form . It follows from the first equation in ( 5 . 20 ) that L X dψ = 0 ⇒ dψ = 0 , ( 5 . 21 ) since the vector fields X = α t ( w ) generate the whole Lie algebra X ( Y ) . If the first group of the De Rham cohomology of Y is trivial , then ψ = df ′ for some function f ′ ∈ C ∞ ( Y ×R ) and the second equation in ( 5 . 20 ) takes the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>X · ( ∂ t f ′ + v · f ′ ) = 0 . ( 5 . 22 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Again , the transitivity implies that ∂ t f ′ + v · f ′ = ˙ g ( t ) for some g ∈ C ∞ ( R ) . Setting f = f ′ − g , one can see that the 1 - form ψ = df defines a characteristic for ( 3 . 15 ) in accordance with ( 3 . 18 ) . So , every proper symmetry for the transitive Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 17 ) comes from some characteristic . This is in agreement with Proposition 5 . 2 . In the case being considered the homomorphism ( 5 . 14 ) is actually an isomorphism . Indeed , if X is the proper symmetry corresponding to a characteristic Ψ = d f ( t , x ) dt , then X = 0 implies that α ( w ) · f = 0 for any 1 - form w . In view of the weak transitivity , f has to be a function of t alone . Then , Ψ = 0 . We thus arrive at the following generalization of the Noether theorem for the first - order ODEs :</p>

				<p>Consider now an integrable Lagrange structure ( E , T , d E ) . In the integrable case , the dual of the dynamics bundle E * → M carries the structure of Lie algebroid and the dif - ferential d E : Γ ( ∧ • E ) → Γ ( ∧ @BULLET+1 E ) makes the exterior algebra of E - differential forms into a cochain complex . Let H • ( E ) = Kerd E / Imd E denote the corresponding cohomol - ogy groups . Classical dynamics on M are specified by a 1 - cocycle T .

				</figure>

				<p>for some S ∈ C ∞ ( M ) . We refer to the last relation by saying that the equations T ′ = 0 are obtained by a proper deformation of the equations T = 0 ; the function S is called a twist .</p>

				<p>The relevance of this notion to the context of conservation laws and proper symmetries is evident from the following simple observation . If S is invariant with respect to the characteristic Ψ ∈</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Notice that the conserved current of the deformed equations T ′ can be different from that of the equations T , even though the characteristic is the same .</p>

				<p>In general the proper deformation ( 5 . 24 ) can be quite nontrivial and by no means re - duces to equivalence transformations of the original equations T , like taking linear com - binations of the equations or change of variables . To exemplify the non - triviality of the deformation ( 5 . 24 ) , it is sufficient to consider a proper deformations of the simplest possi - ble differential equations T i ≡ ˙ x i ( t ) = 0 . ( 5 . 27 ) As is known , these equations enjoy an integrable Lagrange structure given by a vertical Poisson bivector α = α ij ( t , x ) ∂ i ∧ ∂ j on Y × R . Taking the twist S in the form S = − dtH ( t , x ( t ) ) , ( 5 . 28 ) where H ( t , x ) is an arbitrary function , we get the Hamiltonian equations T ′i = T i − α ij δS δx j = ˙ x i − {x i , H} = 0 . ( 5 . 29 )</p>

				<p>So , the proper deformation is quite nontrivial as it can transform the Hamiltonian equa - tions with a given Hamiltonian into equations with any other Hamiltonian and the same Poisson bracket . The characteristics for the original equations ( 5 . 27 ) have the form Ψ = d f ( x ( t ) ) dt , where f ( x ) is an arbitrary function . If the twist ( 5 . 28 ) is invariant with respect to Ψ , then {f , H} = ˙ g ( t ) and the value f − g is an integral of motion of ( 5 . 29 ) .</p>

				<p>To make contact with the general definitions of the previous sections let us mention that the configuration space of fields M is given here by the space Λ p ( X ) and the sections of the dynamics bundle , in particular the equations of motion T = ( T 1 , T 2 ) , take values in the space Λ p+1 ( X ) ⊕ Λ n−p+1 ( X ) . Since M is a linear space , we can identify the tangent space T F M at a point F ∈ M with the space M = Λ p ( X ) itself . Furthermore , by making use of the standard inner product on Λ ( X ) ,</p>

				<p>( X ) , and a , b ∈ R . This family is a straightforward generalization of the Lagrange anchor proposed in [ 7 ] for Maxwell &apos; s electrodynamics in the strength - tensor formalism .</p>

				<p>Since the equations of motion ( 6 . 1 ) are linear and the anchor ( 6 . 4 ) does not depend on fields , the bracket ( 5 . 3 ) is zero and the corresponding Lagrange structure appears to be integrable . To investigate its transitivity we should consider the kernel of the operator V * .</p>

				<p>By definition , a p - form P belongs to ker V * if</p>

					<trash>W , V * ( P ) = 0 ∀W . ( 6 . 5 )</trash>

				<p>Suppose that ab = 0 , then the last condition is equivalent to the equations dP = 0 , d * P = 0 , ( 6 . 6 ) which coincide in form with the equations of motion ( 6 . 1 ) for the field F . Since equations ( 6 . 6 ) enjoy no gauge symmetry , their general solution P cannot depend on arbitrary func - tional parameters 6 . In particular , it cannot depend on the field F . We refer to this situation by saying that the Lagrange anchor ( 6 . 4 ) is almost transitive for ab = 0 .</p>

				<p>Notice also that the Lagrange anchor ( 6 . 4 ) is nontrivial whenever a = b . In case a = b , we can write ( 6 . 4 ) as</p>

				<p>The last expression corresponds to the trivial Lagrange anchor ( 4 . 13 ) with G ( P ) = aP .</p>

				<p>Recall that a vector field ξ ∈ X ( X ) is called a Killing vector of the metric g if L ξ g = 0 . Each Killing vector gives rise to both the symmetry transformation</p>

The latter is given by Ψ 1 = ( −1 ) ( n−p ) ( p−1 ) * i ξ * F , Ψ 2 = ( −1 ) p−1 * i ξ F . ( 6 . 9 ) It is easy to verify that Ψ , T = ( Ψ 1 , T 1 ) + ( Ψ 2 , T 2 ) = X dj , ( 6 . 10 ) where the on - shell closed ( n − 1 ) - form j reads j = 1 2 ( i ξ F ) ∧ * F + ( −1 ) p−1 F ∧ ( i ξ * F ) .

				<p>In terms of local coordinates {x µ } on X the corresponding conserved current is given by the 1 - form * j = ξ µ T µν ( x ) dx ν , ( 6 . 12 ) T µν = T νµ being the symmetric energy - momentum tensor of the p - form field F .</p>

				<p>In view of Proposition 5 . 1 , the characteristic Ψ is bound to be the generator of a proper symmetry . A simple calculation gives δ ξ F = V ( Ψ ) ≈ ( a − b ) L ξ F . ( 6 . 13 )</p>

				<p>So , up to an overall constant , which can be included in ξ , the transformation ( 6 . 13 ) co - incides with the Lie derivative of the p - form F along the Killing vector ξ . As would be expected , the transformation becomes trivial when a = b ( the case of trivial anchor ( 6 . 7 ) ) .</p>

				<p>To summarize , each infinitesimal isometry of the Riemannian manifold ( X , g ) gives rise to a conservation law with the current ( 6 . 12 ) . The Lagrange anchor ( 6 . 4 ) allows us to consider this conservation law as coming from the proper symmetry ( 6 . 13 ) of the field equations ( 6 . 1 ) . Moreover , as the Lagrange anchor is almost transitive for ab = 0 , one can be sure that each proper symmetry V ( Ψ ) results in a conservation law provided that the generator Ψ depends on F .</p>

				<p>By analogy with the previous case we can define the energy - momentum tensor T µν of the self - dual field H + through the conserved current * j = ξ µ T µν ( x ) dx ν . It is easy to see that the tensor T µν is symmetric and traceless .</p>

				<p>According to Proposition 5 . 1 , the anchor ( 6 . 15 ) takes the characteristic Ψ to a proper symmetry of the equations of motion ( 6 . 14 ) .

				<p>Conversely , one could start with the proper symmetry transformation ( 6 . 17 ) , which presence is evident from the very definition of the theory ( 6 . 14 ) , and then argue that the generator Ψ is nothing else but a characteristic to the field equations since the Lagrange anchor ( 6 . 15 ) is almost transitive .

				<head n="7">Conclusion</head>

				<p>Let us make some concluding remarks on the paper results and notice the open questions left for the future studies .</p>

				<p>In the work [ 7 ] , the concept of Lagrange anchor was introduced to formulate the path - integral quantization for not necessarily Lagrangian field theories . In the present paper , we show that another important property of the Lagrangian dynamics - the relationship between rigid symmetries and conservation laws - extends to non - Lagrangian field equa - tions whenever they are endowed with a Lagrange anchor . It was also shown in [ 7 ] that every Lagrange anchor gives rise to and can be related with a certain BRST complex on the ghost - extended configuration space of fields . In the Lagrangian gauge theory , this com - plex boils down to the well - known BRST complex associated with the Batalin - Vilkovisky master action . The unique existence of the local BV master action was proven long ago [ 33 ] under the assumptions that the original Lagrangian was local and the gauge symmetry was finitely reducible . Unlike the Lagrangian theory , the locality of both the Lagrange anchor and the non - Lagrangian equations does not necessarily result in the locality of the corresponding quantum BRST differential . Given a local Lagrange anchor for local field equations , the obstructions to the existence of a local BRST complex will be studied in our next paper . Remarkably , these obstructions , being crucial for the quantum theory , do not matter for the study of classical dynamics . At the classical level , the existence of a local Lagrange anchor is sufficient to link the conservation laws with rigid symmetries , as it is seen from the present paper .</p>

				<p>In the next work we also plan to develop the cohomological description of the rigid symmetries and conservation laws , making use of the BRST formalism for non - Lagrangian gauge theories [ 7 ] . This will extend the cohomological formulation of the Noether theo - rem , well studied in the Lagrangian setting [ 5 ] , to not necessarily Lagrangian dynamics .</p>

				<p>In the entire BRST cohomology , we will identify the characteristic cohomology as well as the cohomology group capturing the rigid symmetries of non - Lagrangian equations of motion . Unlike the Lagrangian theory , these two groups of the BRST cohomology are not to be generally isomorphic to each other .</p>

				<p>One can see that many important ingredients of the Lagrangian dynamics split into different categories in the non - Lagrangian setting . The local Lagrange anchor connects these categories , although not always making them identical . As a result , the Lagrange anchor endows the non - Lagrangian local field theory with some important features of the Lagrangian one . In particular , it offers a path - integral quantization of classical dynamics and establishes a ( partial ) connection between the rigid symmetries and the conservation laws .</p>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> See comments at the end of Sec. 2.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> Of course, one can solve the first equation (6.1) in terms of a gauge potential, F = dA, following which the second equation (6.1) becomes Lagrangian, but we are interested in treating these equations as they are, i.e., without passing to any equivalent Lagrangian formulation.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> For instance, if X is a compact manifold without boundary, then the solutions to Eqs. (6.6) are the harmonic p-forms on X. These form a finite dimensional vector space isomorphic to H p (X).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> It should be stressed that this generalization has nothing to do with a non-abelian deformation of the original (abelian) equations of motion (6.18); the field equations remain the same.</note>
