				<p>We propose to use the different kinds of vacua of the gauge theories coupled to matter as a laboratory to test confinement ideas of pure Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the very poor overlap of the Wilson loop with the broken string states supports the &apos;t Hooft and Mandelstam confinement criteria. However in the Z2 gauge-Higgs model we use as a guide we find that the condensation of monopoles and center vortices is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for confinement.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Center vortices [1] and magnetic monopoles [2] are widely believed to be the collective degrees of freedom responsible for the non-perturbative features of SU (N ) Yang Mills theories, in particular for confinement. Condensation of magnetic monopoles implies a dual Meissner effect: the chromolelectric field is expelled from the vacuum and gives the well-known physical picture of confinement in terms of dual Abrikosov vortices which describe the flux tubes joining static sources. Center vortices are string-like excitations formed out of the center of the gauge group. They produce a very efficient disordering mechanism of the gauge configurations which could lead to area law decay of large Wilson loops. Although the above descriptions for almost all known models remains at a conjectural stage 1 , in the last few years many numerical lattice studies have given strong support for the relevant role played by center vortices and monopole condensation in confinement. For instance in the SU (2) gauge model in 3+1 dimensions it has been observed both magnetic monopole condensation [4, 5, 6, 7] and the phenomenon of center dominance [8], namely the fact that the string tension obtained from center projected configurations in maximal center gauge agrees with the same quantity calculated in the full theory.</p>

				<p>Center dominance is verified in a trivial way in abelian theories, where the whole dynamics is described by center vortices. Here the distinction between confined and unconfined phase is related to the maximal size of the clusters of vortices: it can be shown that the confinement requires the presence of an infinite cluster [10]. This agrees with an earlier observation of percolating center vortices in the cold phase of SU (2) gauge model at finite temperature [11]. For the sake of brevity we call vortex condensation the appearance of such a kind of infinite cluster. There are many open, intertwined, questions about the actual validity of the &apos;t Hooft criteria of confinement, namely that the monopole and/or vortex condensations imply the decay with an area law of large Wilson loops. In particular , is it possible to derive monopole condensation from vortex condensate or vice versa ? If not, are both condensations necessary for confinement? Are they also sufficient? In this work we propose to answer these questions by studying gauge systems coupled to matter. Indeed it is worth noting that while center vortices and monopoles are generally studied in pure Yang Mills models, they are well defined also in gauge theories coupled to matter.</p>

				<p>In these models there are different vacua, distinguished by different entities which condense. If, for instance, the region where the vortices condense does not coincide with that with monopole condensation one can infer that these two properties are logically independent. This is precisely what happens in a 2+1 Z 2 gauge-Higgs model [9] . A simple argument shows [12] that the only vacua compatible with an area-law decay of the large Wilson loops are those in which both magnetic monopoles and center vortices condense. In other terms, the &apos;t Hooft criteria are both necessary for confinement.</p>

				<p>Assuming that they are also sufficient can explain a surprising phenomenon observed in almost all coupled gauge systems studied up to now: although the potential between static sources flattens at large distances because of the screening produced by pair creation, this flattening (called string breaking) is invisible in the Wilson loop: it continues to obey an area law in full QCD [13] even at distances where the static charges are completely screened. The point is that in gauge theories coupled to matter the basis of the operators has to be enlarged [14] in order to get a reliable estimate of the potential. In this way it has been observed the breaking of the confining string in Higgs models [15] and in QCD [16]. So the fact that large Wilson loops obey an area law even in coupled systems, as first suggested in [17], may be considered as a further support to the usual plausibility arguments for the confinement mechanisms. Of course numerical experiments cannot give a true proof of the sufficiency of these criteria: it could well happen that Wilson loops of much larger size exhibit string breaking explicitly.</p>

				<p>In this work we study the 2+1 Z 2 gauge-Higgs model to investigate a subtler issue:by probing the different vacua characterised by infinite vortex and monopole clusters we study the effect of other condensates on confinement. In this model there are two vacua having center vortex and magnetic monopole condensates; one of them has also an electric condensate, i.e. the Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value different from zero. The former fulfils all the requirements of the confinement criteria, so an area law is expected; here we find that the Wilson loop obeys a perfect area law even at distances larger than five times the string breaking scale. The latter can be identified with the torn phase predicted in Ref.[17]: the Wilson loop decays with an area law below a given scale which varies very rapidly as a function of the couplings of the model and is unrelated to the string breaking scale. Above this threshold we observe a perimeter law: the infrared properties of this vacuum are indistinguishable from that of the perturbative unconfined vacuum 2 .</p>

				<p>The phase diagram of this model (see Fig. 1) has been studied long ago [22]. There is an unconfined region surrounded by lines of phase transitions toward the Higgs phase and its dual. These lines are second order until they are near each other and the self-dual line, where first order transition occurs 3 .</p>

					<trash>2.1 Z 2 vortices and monopoles</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In this model the construction of center vortex configurations is straightforward: to each frustrated plaquette (i.e. U = −1) assign a vortex in the dual link. Since the product of the plaquettes belonging to any elementary cube is 1, center vortices form closed subgraphs of even coordination number. Thus a connected vortex subgraph contributes to a given Wilson loop W (C) only if an odd number of lines are linked to it: the Wilson loop is a vortex counter modulo 2. Magnetic monopoles can be defined exactly as in pure gauge model. They live on the dual lattice Λ. To create a monopole in a site x ∈ ˜ Λ, corresponding to the center of an elementary cube of Λ, it is sufficient to draw an arbitrary, continuous line γ(˜ x, ˜ y) joining x to to another monopole located iñ y (or to ∞) and flipping the sign of the coupling of the plaquettes crossed by γ. This flipping is generated by the non-local operator</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Ψ γ (˜ x, ˜ y) = exp(−2β G ∈γ U ) . (4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>As a consequence, the flux across any closed surface with x inside and y outside is equal to -1: this monopole field Ψ γ (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>˜ x, ˜ y) creates one unity of Z 2 flux joining x tõ y. Monopole condensation occurs when lim |˜−˜|→∞ Ψ γ (˜ x, ˜ y) = 0 . (5)</trash>

					<figDesc>Why this condensation should imply confinement? A useful piece of information comes from the Kramers-Wannier duality. One can easily show that under this duality map the monopole correlator transforms as follows</figDesc>
					<trash>Ψ γ (˜ x, ˜ y) βG,βI = ϕ ˜ x ℓ∈γ U ℓ ϕ ˜ y ˜ βI , ˜ βG . (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Thus the monopole condensation is associated to the dual Higgs phase, where the Z 2 symmetry is spontaneously broken. The same transformation maps the Wilson loop W (C) associated to any closed curve C ∈ Λ into the corresponding &apos;t Hooft loop W (C) of the dual phase:</figDesc>

				<p>where Σ is an arbitrary surface bounded by C. W (C) creates an elementary Z 2 flux along C which manifests itself as a topological defect: the action of W (C) on an arbitrary configuration maps the product η</p>

				<head>.</head>

				<p>To understand this property at a microscopic level it is convenient to resort to the Fortuin Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster representation [19] of the model.</p>

				<figure>

				<figure>
					<trash>Z(β G , β I ) = U ℓ e βGU G⊆Λ ̟ U (G) v bG 2 cG , v = p 1 − p , (10)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The summation is over all spanning subgraphs G ⊆ Λ. b G is the number of links of G, called active bonds (which are the matter degrees of freedom replacing the ϕ&apos;s in this representation), and c G is the number of connected components, called FK clusters. ̟ U (G) is a projector on the subgraphs which are compatible with a given gauge configuration U = {U ℓ }: only those subgraphs are allowed for which no closed path within each FK cluster is linked to an elementary Z 2 flux [21]. Put differently, no frustration is permitted in G. In a sense, this is a microscopic realization of a sort of dual Meissner effect: the FK clusters behave like pieces of dual superconducting matter of type I and no Z 2 flux can go through the circuits of G. This is the only constraint generated by the interaction between matter and gauge fields. In the limit β G → ∞ all the plaquettes have U = 1 (trivial gauge vacuum) hence the sum over the subgraphs is unconstrained and one gets the standard Ising model.</p>

(11)</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Assume that there are only FK clusters of finite size ( this is the case of the region V in Fig. 2). If C is much larger than the mean size of the clusters, the configurations contributing to W (C), i.e. those with ̟ C (G) = 1, are characterised by the fact that there is no cluster linked to C. The weight of this class of configurations, when compared with the total ensemble G ⊆ Λ is clearly suppressed by a factor e −α p(C) , where p(C) is the length of C. Thus in this phase the Wilson loop obeys a perimeter law. Conversely, a large Wilson loop decaying with an area law implies by necessity the presence of an infinite FK cluster. In order to see whether this condition is also sufficient for confinement in the dual phase, note that according to Eq.(11) an infinite FK cluster f k ∞ gives a non-vanishing contribution to W (C) only if there is at least a simply connected surface Σ bounded by C which is not pierced by the loops of the cluster. If the links of f k ∞ are weakly correlated, one is led to argue that the weight of the configurations compatible with W (C) is suppressed by a factor e −σ a(Σ) , where a(Σ) is the area of the minimal surface with ∂Σ = C. This leads to the area-law decay of W (C). A crucial assumption in the above argument is the weak correlation of the links of f k ∞ which describe at the microscopic level the monopole condensation.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We shall see that there is a phase in which, though such a condensation occurs, this assumption is no longer true. Correspondingly we observe a violation of the area-law. We can now apply the same line of reasoning to the center vortices (CV). Finite CV clusters can link with the &apos;t Hooft loop only along its perimeter. Therefore they contribute only to the perimeter term. An infinite CV cluster is necessary for the area-law: confinement implies both infinite center vortex subgraph and magnetic monopole condensation. In pure gauge theory these two requirements coincide, while in the coupled system the vacuum structure is more intriguing.</p>

				<head n="2.3">The vacua</head>

				<p>In the coupled theory we have two kinds of dynamical subgraphs: CV or FK clusters in the dual lattice describe the gauge field degrees of freedom; FK clusters in the direct lattice describe the charged Higgs matter.</p>

				<p>In order to recognise an infinite cluster in practical simulations one has to look at the cluster size s as a function of the lattice volume V . We say that there is an infinite cluster whenever s ∝ V for large enough V . Straightforward numerical experiments show that they are distributed in the phase diagram according to Fig.2 and Tab.1. There are four kinds of infinite clusters: i) FK cluster in the dual lattice (magnetic condensate), ii) FK cluster in the direct lattice (electric condensate), iii) CV cluster in the dual lattice, iv) CV cluster in the direct lattice (dual CV).</p>

				<p>In the region V there is no infinite cluster of any type. This is the perturbative , weak coupling vacuum, where large Wilson loops and &apos;t Hooft loops obey a perimeter-law. The region IV is characterised by an electric condensate: it is the normal Higgs phase, where the Wilson loops decay with a perimeter-law, while the &apos;t Hooft loops obey an area-law.</p>

				<p>Region III has a magnetic condensate but no large center vortices, then there is no confinement, as confirmed by numerical tests. This region is dual to the region II, where we shall see that the Wilson loops follow a perimeter-law decay. Because of duality relation (7) we can infer that also W (C) decays in the same way.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The regions I and II have both CV and FK infinite clusters in the dual lattice.</p>

				<p>The former is a normal confining phase: the potential extracted from an enlarged basis shows the expected string breaking (see Fig.3b), while the Wilson loop obeys a perfect area-law even at a large scale (see Fig.4). This has been checked up to distances of the order of five times the string breaking scale (compare Fig.3b and Fig.4). The latter is a phase with the simultaneous presence of infinite clusters in the direct and the dual lattices. The infinite cluster of Λ is associated to the condensation of the Higgs field ϕ x , while the infinite CV cluster of Λ is typical of a confining phase. However there is no confinement in the IR limit: the nofrustration constraint induces strong correlations among Z 2 flux lines, because only an even number of them can pass through the closet paths within the FK clusters.</p>

				<p>As a matter of fact, large Wilson loops obey a perimeter-law decay, even if at intermediate distances an area-law seems recovered. A first example of this behavior is reported in [9]. The cross-over scale varies rapidly as a function of the coupling constant and is unrelated to the string breaking scale.</p>

				<head n="3">Numerical results</head>

				<p>As we have anticipated, even in this model, like in the other gauge systems coupled to matter analysed up to now, the Wilson loop fails to exhibit string breaking in the normal, confining phase, due to its poor (or vanishing) projection onto the screened potential. One has to use additional operators with good projection on the ground state, as first observed in Ref.[14]</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In practical simulations, the limit T → ∞ is not realized. In our case T was typically less that twenty lattice spacings when the the signal was lost in noise.</p>

				<p>The first point chosen in the present investigation is given by the couplings β G = 0.75245 and β I = 0.16683 . This point in the phase diagram of Fig.2 is in the phase I, fairly close to the deconfinement transition, where the model has properties very similar to the confining phase of pure gauge theory [23]. The estimates of the above three operators in a lattice of size 40 3 as functions of R are reported in Fig.3a and the static potential obtained the measure of 6 different T in Fig.3b. We observe the typical string breaking phenomenon with a Wilson loop which seems to follow the area-law decay even in the region where the string is broken. In order to see better this property, we used a powerful algorithm based on Eq.(11) and already used in pure gauge theory [24]. We also modified each configuration in the Monte Carlo ensemble by eliminating all the FK clusters not belonging to the largest cluster. It has been shown that this transformation does not change the value of the string tension but greatly reduce the noise of the measurements. The results are reported in Fig.4 : the square Wilson loops obey a perfect area-law even at distances five times the string breaking scale at this point.</p>

				<p>In order to investigate the effect of the electric condensate on the Wilson loop, we considered two different points in the phase diagram, one in the region I, at β G = 0.6867 and β I = 0.20, which is a normal confining phase. The other is in the region II, at β G = 0.66 and β I = 0.27 where besides the CV (and the FK) infinite cluster in the dual lattice there is also a percolating FK cluster in the direct lattice, associated to the &quot; electric &quot; condensation. These two points are chosen in such a way that the total size of the CV vortices are the same (within the statistical errors) in the two cases. It turned out that also the size of the maximal CV cluster is approximately the same. We also verified that this quantity scales with the volume for large enough lattices. The dramatic effect produced by the electric condensate is demonstrated by the completely different behaviors of the square Wilson loop in the two cases, as is evident in Fig.5. In the region I we see again the characteristic area-law of the normal confining phase, while the data of region II are compatible, for the Wilson squares of larger size, with a decay with the perimeter. This is the behavior expected for the torn phase [17]</p>

				<head n="4">Conclusions</head>

				<p>In this study we proposed to use the gauge theories coupled to charged matter to test the confinement ideas of &apos;t Hooft and Mandelstam. In particular, in the case of the Z 2 gauge-Higgs model, we gave a detailed microscopic description of the center vortex and monopole condensates. The analysis of the different vacua of this theory led us to conclude that • confinement requires that both magnetic monopoles and center vortices condense.</p>

				<p>• plausibility arguments suggest that these two kinds of infinite clusters are responsible of the area-law decay of Wilson loop only if the links of these clusters are weekly correlated.</p>

				<p>• there are vacua where the condensation of the gauge degrees of freedom (monopoles or center vortices) is associated with a condensate of the matter field (the Higgs field in our example). This yields strong correlations among vortices and monopoles so that the plausibility arguments for confinement we alluded above are no longer justified. In fact we observed a perimeter-law decay of large Wilson loops. This could be identified with the torn phase described in [17].</p>
