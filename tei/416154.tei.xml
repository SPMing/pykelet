				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>The basic ideas of non-commutative geometry were developed in [1, 2], and in the form of the matrix geometry in [3, 4]. The applications to physical models were presented in [2, 5], where the non-commutativity was in some sense minimal: the Minkowski space was not extended by some standard Kaluza-Klein manifold describing internal degrees of freedom, but just by two discrete points. The algebra of functions on this manifold remains commutative , but the complex of the differential forms does not. This led to a new insight on the SU(2) L U(1) R symmetry of the standard model of electroweak interactions. The consideration of gravity was included in [6].</p>

				<p>Such models, of course, do not lead to UV-regularization, since they do not introduce any modification of the space-time short-distance behaviour.</p>

				<p>To achieve the UV-regularization one should introduce a non-commutative deformation of the algebra of functions on a space-time manifold in the Minkowski case, or on the space manifold in the Euclidean version. One of the simplest locally Euclidean manifolds is the sphere S 2 . Its non-commutative (fuzzy) deformation was described by [7,8] in the framework of the matrix geometry . A more general construction of some non-commutative homogenous spaces was described in [9] using coherent-states technique.</p>

				<p>The first attempts to construct fields on a truncated sphere were presented in [8,10] within the matrix formulation. Using a more general approach, the fields on truncated S 2 were investigated in detail in [11–13]. In particular, in [11] it was the quantum scalar field on the truncated S 2 and it was explicitly demonstrated that the UV-regularization automatically takes place upon the non-commutative deformation of the algebra of functions.</p>

				<p>In this article we extend this approach from the 2-dimensional sphere S 2 to the 4-dimensional one. Since S 4 is not a (co)-adjoint orbit, this extension has some new nontrivial features. We shall introduce only the necessary notions of the non-commutative geometry we needed for our approach.</p>

				<p>In Sec. 2 we describe briefly the standard (commutative) sphere S 4 as the Hopf fibration S 7 → S 4 and the scalar self-interacting field on it. Section 3 is devoted to the generalization of the model to the non-commutative truncated sphere S 4 introducing the non-commutative analogue of the Hopf fibration.</p>

				<p>Then, using Feynman (path) integrals, we perform the quantization of the model in question. Last, Sec. 4 contains a brief discussion and concluding remarks.</p>

				<p>Here we describe the standard sphere S 4 in the form that will be suitable for the non-commutative generalization. Our basic tools are the real quaternions</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ϕ = ϕ (a) e a ∈ H (1) with ϕ (a) real and the quaternionic units e 1 =    0 i i 0    , e 2 =    0 1 −1 0    , e 3 =    i 0 0 −i    , e 4 =    1 0 0 1    , (2) satisfying the relations e i e j = −δ ij − ε ijk e k , e 4 e i = e i e 4 . (3) We shall usually write 1 instead of e 4 . The coefficient ϕ (0) = 1 2</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>trφ is called the real part of the quaternion, and ϕ (i) , i = 1, 2, 3, are pure quaternionic components. The explicit realization (2) of the quaternionic units allows us to identify the space of quaternions with C 2 : any quaternion we represent</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>by 2 × 2 complex matrix ϕ =    ϕ * 2 ϕ 1 −ϕ * 1 ϕ 2    . (4) The quaternionic conjugation ϕ → ϕ * defined by e i → e * i = −e i , i = 1, 2, 3 , e 4 → e * 4 = e 4 ,</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>then corresponds to the Hermitian conjugation of complex matrices. We shall frequently use both descriptions without an explicit specification. Further, the quaternionic length |ϕ| is defined by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>|ϕ| 2 = ϕ * ϕ = ϕ 2 (a) = detϕ . (5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>If |ϕ| = 1, ϕ is called a unit quaternion. The set of unit quaternions is isomorphic to the group SU(2) (and as a topological space to S 3 ).</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>The group Sp(4) we identify with the group of 2×2 quaternionic matrices of the form A =    cos θ 2 α sin θ 2 γβ * − sin θ 2 γ * α cos θ 2 β *    , (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where α, β, γ are unit quaternions, and θ ∈ [0, π] is a real angle.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>The Lie algebra sp(4) = so(5) is spanned by 10 anti-Hermitian matrices ξ AB = −ξ BA , A, B = 1, ..., 5, given as ξ a5 =    0 e a −e * a 0    =: ξ a , ξ ab = ξ a ξ b , (7) where a, b = 1, ..., 4, a = b. The matrices ξ ab span the Lie algebra so(4) = so(3) ⊕ so(3). Supplementing (7) by five matrices ˜ ξ a =    0 e a e * a 0    , ˜ ξ 5 =    1 0 0 −1    , a = 1, ..., 4 , (8) we recover the basis of the Lie algebra su * (4) = so(5, 1). It is closely related to the Clifford algebra C 4,0 with the basis ξ a , a = 1, ..., 4: C 4,0 =               ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 ξ 4 ξ a ξ b ξ c , 1 ≤ a &lt; b &lt; c ≤ 4 ξ a ξ b , 1 ≤ a &lt; b ≤ 4 ξ a , 1 ≤ a ≤ 4 1               =               ˜ ξ 5 ˜ ξ a , 1 ≤ a ≤ 4 ξ ab , 1 ≤ a &lt; b ≤ 4 ξ a , 1 ≤ a ≤ 4 1               , (9) where the matrices ξ a , ξ ab are anti-Hermitian whereas the matrices ξ A , A = 1, ..., 5, are Hermitian and transform as an SO(5) vector. The matrices A ∈ Sp(4) act in a natural way in the space H 2 : z =    ϕ χ    ∈ H 2 → Az =    ˜ aϕ + ˜ bχ cϕ + ˜ dχ    ∈ H 2 . (10) The sphere S 7 , given by the equation z + z = |ϕ| 2 + |χ| 2 = 1 , (11) is transitively invariant under this action. Introducing the equivalence rela- tion z ∼ z ′ = zα , α − unit quaternion , (12) we recover the sphere S 4 as the Hopf fibration S 7 → S 4 . To any equivalence class (13) we assign the SO(5) vector given by the Cartesian coordinates in R 5 : x A = 1 2 tr(z + ˜ ξ A z) = 1 2 tr(z ′ + ˜ ξ A z ′ ) . (13) These are just the Cartesian coordinates of the sphere S 4 embedded into R 5</trash>

					<trash>= 1, ..., 5: Φ(x) = A M x M , A M − complex , (14) with the usual point-wise multiplication. Here we used the multi-index notation: M = (M 1 , ..., M 5 ), x M = x M 1 1 ...x M 5 5 . In A ∞ we introduce the scalar product (Φ 1 , Φ 2 ) ∞ = I ∞ [Φ * 1 Φ 2 ] , (15) where I ∞ [...] denotes the usual SO(5)-invariant integral on S 4 : I ∞ [...] = 3 4π 2 d 5 x δ(x 2 A − 1) [...] , (16) where the normalization guarantees that I ∞ [1] = 1. The Sp(4) action (10) in the algebra A ∞ generates R 5 rotations, leaving the quantity x 2 A = 1 invariant. The generators of this action (anti-Hermitian with respect to the scalar product given above) are given as ˆ J AB Φ = 1 2 (ψ * α ξ αβ AB ∂ ψ * β + ψ β ξ αβ AB ∂ ψα )Φ . (17) Here ξ αβ</trash>

				<figure>
					<trash>χ 1 , ψ 4 = χ 2 , ψ * 1 = ϕ * 1 , ψ * 2 = ϕ * 2 , ψ * 3 = χ * 1 , ψ * 4 = χ * 2 . (18) It follows from (17) that the quantities ψ α , ψ * α , α = 1, ..., 4, transform as S 4 spinors ˆ J AB ψ α = 1 2 ξ αβ AB ψ β , ˆ J AB ψ * β = 1 2 ξ αβ AB ψ * α . (19) Consequently, the quantities x A , A = 1, ..., 5 given as x A = ψ + ˜ ξ A ψ = ψ * α ˜ ξ αβ A ψ β , (20) where ξ αβ A are elements of the complex matrix assigned tõ ξ A , transforms as a vector in R 5 . Moreover, the function C(x) = x 2 A satisfies ˆ J AB C(x) = 0 , A, B = 1, ..., 5 , (21) i.e. C(x) is an invariant function as expected. The Sp(4</trash>

				<p>In the non-commutative (fuzzy) case we replace the commuting parameters (18) by the non-commutative ones. Namely, we shall express the parameters ψ α , ψ * α , α = 1, ..., 4 in terms of annihilation and creation operators as ψ α = A α R</p>

In A N we introduce the scalar product (Φ 1 , Φ 2 ) N = I N [Φ * 1 Φ 2 ] , (36) where I N [...] is the analogue of the SO(5)-invariant integral on S 4 : I N [...] = 1 d N 0 Tr N [...] . (37)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here Tr N [...] denotes the trace in the algebra A N , and the normalization guarantees that I N [1] = 1.</p>

				<p>As a non-commutative analogue of (18) we have a commutator action of the sp(4) algebra in A N :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ J AB Φ(x) = [J AB , Φ(x)] , (38) with J AB defined in (31). This is a reducible representation with the following decomposition to Sp(4) irreducible components: (N, 0) ⊗ (N, 0) = N p=0 p k=0 (p + k, p − k) . (39)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This decomposition induces the decomposition of the algebra A N :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A N = N p=0 p k=0 A p+k,p−k N , (40) where A p ′ k ′ N is the carrier space of the Sp(4) representation (p ′ , k ′ ).

				</figure>

				<p>In the commutative case, the decomposition (22) of the algebra A ∞ contains only representations (p, p) = π p 2 corresponding to terms with k = 0 in the decomposition (40).</p>

				<p>Note: We would like to stress that it is not essential that the generators x A , A = 1, ..., 5, given in (35) do not close to some Lie algebra (they close to a Lie algebra only after supplementing them by the operators (31)). The following point is important, however: the decomposition (40) of the basic algebra A N under the symmetry transformation in question (this aspect was less transparent for the truncated sphere S 2 , since in this case the generators closed to a Lie algebra, see [11]). The detailed information contained in Eq. (40) is necessary for realistic numerical or symbolical calculations.</p>

				<p>We identify the space of the configurations of a real scalar field with the</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>subspace A R N = N p=0 A pp N , (42)</trash>

					<figDesc>of symmetric polynomials in x A , A = 1, ..., 5, with real coefficients. Such fields can be expanded as</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p><formula>Φ(x) = N p=0 d ′ pk µ=1 a p µ Ψ pp µ , (43)</formula></p>

				<p>where the coefficient a p µ are real provided that Ψ pp µ are chosen to be Hermitian (if this is not the case the coefficients a p µ satisfy some relations that guarantee that the field in question is a Hermitian operator in F N ). This guarantees that in the commutative limit N → ∞ we recover from (43) only fields that have the proper form (23).</p>

				<p>In the non-commutative case the field action corresponding to the real scalar field Φ is given as S[Φ]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>= I N 1 2 ( ˆ J AB Φ) 2 + V (Φ) , (44)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where V (.) is a polynomial bounded from below. Obviously, this action has the following basic properties: 1) it has the full SO(5) symmetry corresponding to S 4 rotations, and 2) it describes a model with a finite number of modes since, in fact, it corresponds to a particular matrix model.</p>

				<p>The quantum mean value of some polynomial field functional F [Φ] is defined as the functional integral F [Φ] = DΦe −S[Φ] F [Φ] DΦe −S[Φ] . (45)</p>

				<p>However, here DΦ = p,µ da p µ (eventually with the reality conditions included ) is the usual Lebesgue measure, since now the product is finite (p = 0, 1, ..., N, and µ = 1, ..., d ′ pp ). The quantum mean values are well defined for any polynomial functional F [Φ]</p>

				<head n="4">Concluding Remarks</head>

				<p>We have demonstrated that the interacting scalar field on the noncommutative sphere S 4 represents a quantum system that has the following properties: 1) The model has the full SO(5) space symmetry under the rotations of the sphere S 4 . This is exactly the same symmetry as the interacting scalar field on the standard sphere S 4 possesses. 2) The field has only a finite number of modes. Then the number of degrees of freedom is finite, which leads to the non-perturbative UV-regularization, i.e. all quantum mean values of polynomial field functionals are well defined and finite.</p>

				<p>In our approach the UV cut-off in the number of modes is supplemented with a highly non-trivial vertex modification due to non-trivial products of fields. Our UV-regularization is non-perturbative and is completely determined by the algebra A N . It is originated by the short-distance structure of the space, and does not depend on the field action of the model in question.</p>

				<p>Moreover, it can be shown that the Schwinger functions S n (F ) = F n [Φ]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>, (46) where F n [Φ] = α p 1 ...pn µ 1 ...µn (Ψ p 1 µ 1 , Φ) N . . . (Ψ pn µn , Φ) N satisfy the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms: (OS1) Hermiticity S * n (F ) = S n (ΘF ) ,</trash>

				<p>Note: We do not include the last Osterwalder-Schrader axiom, the cluster property, since the compact manifold requires a special treatment (however, it can be recovered in the limit where the radius of the sphere grows to infinity, but these considerations go beyond the presented scheme). Qualitatively, the properties of the Schwinger functions are the same as those valid for the truncated sphere S 2 , see [11]. We would like to stress that the properties of standard Schwinger functions not included above (e.g. support, or singularity and growth, specification) are essential again in the commutative limit N →</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>∞.</head>

				<p>The usual divergences will appear only in the commutative limit N → ∞. It would be very interesting to isolate the large-N behaviour nonperturbatively . By this we mean the Wilson-like approach in which the renormalization group flow in the space of Lagrangians is studied. In this context a connection may be found with similar recent works [15].</p>

				<p>Combining the results of this paper with those of [11–13] we obtain a set of UV-regularized Euclidean quantum field models on S 2 and S 4 : a) the scalar field on the truncated S 2 , which is super-renormalizable, b) the Neveu-Schwarz model on the truncated S 2 , which is renormalizable, c) the scalar field on the truncated S 4 with Φ 4 interaction which is renormalizable too.</p>

				<p>Analogous models formulated on standard Euclidean planes (R 2 or R 4 instead of spheres) served as important examples in the proof of the existence of quantum fields in continuum Euclidean spaces in the framework of the Wilson approach (see [16, 17] for the super-renormalizable case, and [18, 19] for the renormalizable one).</p>

				<p>We have an alternative approach: the regularization procedure is nonperturbative and preserves all space symmetries of the models in question.</p>

				<p>The UV-regularization in our scheme can be interpreted as a direct consequence of the short-distance structure induced by the non-commutative geometry of the underlying space. This can lead to a better understanding of the origin and properties of divergences in quantum field theory.</p>
