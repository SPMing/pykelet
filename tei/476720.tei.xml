				<p>Barrett and Crane have proposed a model of simplicial Euclidean quantum gravity in which a central role is played by a class of Spin(4) spin networks called &quot; relativistic spin networks &quot; which satisfy a series of physically motivated constraints. Here a proof is presented that demonstrates that the intertwiner of a vertex of such a spin network is uniquely determined, up to normalization, by the representations on the incident edges and the constraints. Moreover, the constraints, which were formulated for four valent spin networks only, are extended to networks of arbitrary valence, and the generalized relativistic spin networks proposed by Yetter are shown to form the entire solution set (mod normalization) of the extended constraints. Finally, using the extended constraints, the Barrett-Crane model is generalized to arbitrary polyhedral complexes (instead of just simplicial complexes) representing spacetime. It is explained how this model, like the Barret-Crane model can be derived from BF theory by restricting the sum over histories to ones in which the left handed and right handed areas of any 2-surface are equal. It is known that the solutions of classical Euclidean GR form a branch of the stationary points of the BF action with respect to variations preserving this condition.</p>

				<p>The &quot; Relativistic spin networks &quot; defined by Barrett and Crane (BC) are a fundamental ingredient of their proposal for a simpicial model of quantum general relativity in four dimensions. In [BaCr97] the space of intertwiners that relativistic spin networks are allowed to carry is defined implicitly by a set of physically motivated constraints. They also exhibit a single solution to these constraints. Soon after Barbieri [Barb97b] gave a partial proof of the uniqueness up to normalization of this solution, which relies on some unproven hypothesies. BC&apos;s constraints apply only to 4-valent spin networks, but their solution to their constraints has been generalized in a natural way to arbitrary valence by Yetter [Yet98], and Barrett [Ba98] has given a very transparent characterization of this extension in the non q deformed case, q = 1. Here a proof (without auxhiliary assumptions) will be given showing that the BC solution is the only one, up to normalization, and similarly Yetter&apos;s generalization of the solution (for q = 1) is the unique solution up to normalization of a natural generalization of the BC constraints. In addition a physically motivated extension of the BC model to polyhedral complexes is outlined. The BC model can be obtained from a sum over histories quantization of Spin(4) BF theory by restricting the histories to ones that assign equal (suitably defined) left-handed and right-handed areas to any 2-surface. At the classical continuum level such a constrained BF theory does reproduce GR. The solutions of GR form a branch of the stationary points of the Spin(4) BF action with respect to variations that preserve the constraint that the left and right handed areas be equal for all 2-surfaces [Rei98]. This procedure for obtaining the BC model generalizes straighforwardly to complexes of convex 4-polyhedra. For background information on spin networks see [YLV62, Pen69, RS95, Bae96, Rei94].</p>

				<head n="2">Definition of relativistic spin networks</head>

				<p>I will adopt the following definition of relativistic spin networks, which generalizes BC&apos;s definition from 4-valent vertices to vertices of arbitrary valence.</p>

				<p>Definition 1: A relativistic spin network is a Spin(4) spin network such that 1 On each edge the left handed spin, j L , and the right handed spin, j R , are equal.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>2</head>

				<p>In any expansion of an n-valent vertex into a sum of trivalent trees only trivalent trees with j L = j R on each of the internal (virtual) edges appear.</p>

				<p>In general the edges of a spin network carry non-trivial irreducible representations (irreps) of the gauge group, and the vertices carry intertwiners. The intertwiner for a vertex can be any invariant tensor of the product representation R formed by the product of the irreps carried by the incoming edges and the duals of the irreps on the outgoing edges. 1 The space of invariant tensors of R will be denoted Inv(R). The evaluation of a spin network is a complex number calculated by contracting the intertwiners of the vertices along the edges. An intertwiner carries one index for each incident edge.</p>

				<p>In the evaluation of a spin network the pair of indices associated with each edge (one index lives at each end) is contracted, leaving ultimately a single C number. In the BC model histories of the gravitational field determine relativistic spin networks on the boundaries of the 4-simplices that form the simplicial spacetime, and the probability amplitude of each history is the product of the evaluations of these spin networks (times some simple further factors associated with the lower dimensional simplices).</p>

				<p>Relativistic spin networks are spin networks of Spin(4) , the covering group of SO(4). Spin(4) is the product of two SU(2)s: Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2), where the first SU(2) factor will be called SU(2) L , the &quot; left handed &quot; subgroup, and the second SU(2) R , the &quot; right handed &quot; subgroup. This factorization extends to the irreps of Spin(4) . These are tensor products of an irrep of SU(2) L and an irrep of SU(2) R , and their carrying spaces, i.e the vector spaces on which they act, are the tensor products of the carrying spaces of the SU(2) L and SU(2) R irreps.</p>

				<p>The dual of a representation D of a group is the representation D −1 T formed by the transposes of the inverses of the representation matrices of D. If D is unitary its dual is the complex conjugate representation D * formed by complex conjugating each matrix element in the representation matrices of D.</p>

				<figure>
					<head>2 Proof:</head>

					<figDesc>The representation matrices D ( g L , g R ) of a representation D of SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R may always be written as D L ( g L ) D R ( g R ) where D L ( g L</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>The factorization of the irreps implies that the product R of irreps inci - dent on a spin network vertex also factorizes into a left - handed factor , R L , and a right handed factor , R R , and hence that the intertwiner space factorizes according to</p>

				<figure>

				<p>into a tensor product of two SU ( 2 ) intertwiner spaces . SU ( 2 ) irreps are determined by their spin , modulo the freedom to change basis in the carrying space . Spin ( 4 ) irreps are therefore characterized in the same sense by the spins ( j L , j R ) of their left and right handed factors . To keep the mathematics as concrete as possibloe it is convenient to fix the bases in the carrying spaces so that the irreps take a standard form completely determined by their spins ( j L ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>j R ) . 3 We shall adopt as our standard ( j L , j R ) irrep U ( j L ) ⊗ U ( j R ) * , ( 2 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where for each spin j , U ( j ) is a particular , unitary , spin j SU ( 2 ) irrep fixed once and for all by some conventions , 4 and U ( j ) * is its dual irrep . This choice can be made because , firstly , the compactness of SU ( 2 ) implies that its irreps preserve a hermitean inner product , and are thus unitary in orthonormal bases with respect to this inner product , and secondly because the dual of a spin j SU ( 2 ) irrep is also a spin j irrep , so that the Spin ( 4 ) irrep chosen really has right handed spin j R .</p>

				<p>Now let &apos; s consider a spin network vertex . First let &apos; s define some notation . Once the bases are fixed the product representation R formed by the incident these subspaces they decompose into tensor products of D L and D R invariant subspaces , and the restriction of D to these are tensor products of irreps of SU ( 2 ) L and SU ( 2 ) R . The orbit of any vector in the carrying space of such a product of irreps clearly spans all of the carrying space , so the products are irreducible representations of SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R . 3 Note that the evaluation of a spin network is invariant under changes of basis in the carrying spaces of the irreps on the edges . The contractions of the indices of the intertwiners are all between vector indices of some irrep and corresponding covector indices , i . e . vector indices of the dual of the irrep .</p>

				</figure>

				<p>irreps is completely determined by the incident spins and whether edges are incoming or outgoing . This information can be gathered into two vectors , j L and j R , which we shall , in a slight abuse of language , refer to as the vectors of incident left handed and right handed spins . Each entry of j L corresponds to an incident edge and consists of the left handed spin , j L , if the edge is incoming and −j L if the edge is outgoing . The left handed factor of R is then R L =</p>

					<trash>R ( j L ) where R ( j ) = n U ( jn ) . ( 4 ) ( n numbers the edges and we have defined U ( −j ) ≡ U ( j ) * ) . j R is defined in complete analogy to j L , so our conventions for the Spin ( 4 ) irreps on the edges imply that R = R ( j L ) ⊗ R ( j R ) * . If H ( j ) is the carrying space of the SU ( 2 ) representation R ( j ) , and Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) ≡ Inv SU ( 2 ) ( R ( j ) ) is its invariant subspace then the carrying space of R = R ( j L ) ⊗ R ( j R ) * is H ( j L ) ⊗ H ( j R ) * and the Spin ( 4 ) intertwiner space is Inv Spin ( 4 ) ( j L , j R ) = Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j L ) ⊗ Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) * .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The inner product preserved by the unitary representation R ( j ) estab - lishes a one to one correspondence between vectors of H ( j ) * and linear func - tions H ( j ) → C . A tensor Ψ ∈ H ( j L ) ⊗ H ( j R ) * can thus be viewed as a linear mapping Ψ : H ( j R ) → H ( j L ) . If the tensor Ψ is an intertwiner it maps</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) into Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j L ) and the orthogonal complement of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) in H ( j R ) to zero .</trash>

					<figDesc>Condition 1 in the definition of relativistic spin networks implies that j L = j R at their vertices . Thus a relativistic intertwiner Φ may be viewed as a mapping of H ( j R ) into itself , that furthermore maps Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) into itself and the orthogonal complement of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) to zero . It is the composition of the orthogonal projector P onto Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) and a linear mapping X of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j R ) to itself : Φ = XP .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Condition 2 in the definition of relativistic spin networks refers to trivalent tree expansions of spin network vertices . It is well known ( see [ YLV62 ] , [ DPR96 ] ) that for SU ( 2 ) spin networks each trivalent tree graph having the same exter - nal edges as a given vertex defines a basis of the intertwiner space Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) of the vertex . 5 ( The trivalent tree has oriented edges and a cyclic order - ing of the edges incident at each vertex . ) Each element of such a &quot; trivalent tree basis &quot; is associated with an assignment J of ( possibly zero ) spins to the internal edges of the tree ( also known as &quot; virtual &quot; edges because they are not present in the actual spin network ) . The basis element is evaluated by contracting the intertwiners of the trivalent vertices along the internal edges as in a spin network evaluation . This leaves just the intertwiner in - dices associated with the external edges free . To complete the definition one needs to specify the trivalent intertwiners . The trivalent intertwiner spaces Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j 1 , j 2 , j 3 ) of SU ( 2 ) are all one dimensional , so it is sufficient to fix the freedom to multiply the intertwiners by scalar factors . We will choose the trivalent intertwiners to be normalized . Then , if a normalizing factor √ 2J + 1 is included for each internal edge , the trivalent tree intertwiners will be normalized . There remains a phase which must be chosen by conven - tion . We will suppose that such a convention has been adopted , 6 so that the trivalent tree T and the vector J of spins on the internal edges determine a unique intertwiner |T , j , J ∈ Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) . Spin ( 4 ) trivalent tree bases can be then be constructed from the SU ( 2 ) trivalent tree bases : If the trivalent tree T spans a Spin ( 4 ) vertex with incident spins ( j L , j R ) then the multiplet</p>

				<p>Now that relativistic spin networks have been defined and explained we are ready to state and prove our result : Theorem The intertwiner of any vertex in a relativistic spin network is uniquely determined , up to a numerical factor , by the irreps on the incident edges . Let j = j L = j R be the common value of the vectors of left and right handed incident spins ( as defined in §2 ) at a vertex , and let H ( j ) be the space of tensors transforming under the product of the SU ( 2 ) irreps with these spins , equipped with the Hermitean inner product preserved by SU ( 2 ) . When the bases in the carrying spaces of the SU ( 2 ) L and SU ( 2 ) R irreps on the edges of the relativistic spin network are chosen so that the SU ( 2 ) L irrep is the dual of the SU ( 2 ) R irrep on each edge incident on the vertex then 1 tensors , like the intertwiner , that transform under the product of the incident Spin ( 4 ) irreps live in the tensor product of H ( j ) and its dual , and can thus be viewed as linear mappings of H ( j ) to itself , and 2 the intertwiner is proportional to the orthogonal projector from H ( j ) to the subspace of invariant tensors Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) ⊂ H ( j ) .</p>

				<figure>
					<head>Proof :</head>

					<figDesc>Part 1 has already been established in §2 , so only part 2 remains to be proven . ( 6 ) shows that an intertwiner , Φ , of a relativistic spin network is the composition of the projector P from the space H ( j ) of tensors with spins j onto the subspace of intertwiners Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) and a linear map X of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) to itself . ( 6 ) furthermore requires that X is diagonal in each of the trivalent tree bases of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Obviously X = c1 with c ∈ C satisfies this condition , so cP is a relativistic intertwiner . To establish the theorem it remains to be shown that the set of all trivalent tree bases is rich enough so that this is the only solution to the condition . Let us first consider four valent vertices . There are three ( unoriented ) trivalent trees matching the four incident edges ,</p>

				<p>❅ ❅ ❅ ❅ each of which has one internal , or virtual , edge . Once the orientations of the external edges are fixed to match those of the four valent vertex being expanded there remains the freedom to choose the orientation of the internal edge and the cyclic ordering of the incident edges at the two trivalent vertices . However these choices only affect the signs of the corresponding trivalent tree basis , modulo sign it is determined by the unoriented tree graph . Let &apos; s number the incident edges 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 clockwise from the top left , and let G n i for n ∈ {1 , 2 , 3 , 4} be the generators , 7 acting in H ( j ) , of the SU ( 2 ) irreps on the incident edges . Let &apos; s also define G mn i = ( G m + G n ) i . The first of the trivalent trees drawn above corresponds to a pairing of edges 1 and 2 , which join at a trivalent vertex . The corresponding basis intertwiners ❅ ❅ ❅ ❅ J is a contraction of a trivalent intertwiner at this vertex and one at the other vertex of the graph .

				<p>. What &apos; s more , since the spec - tra of these operators ( {J ( J + 1 ) } ) are non - degenerate , X can be expressed as a function of any one of them .</p>

					<trash>Choosing G 2 12 we write X = d−1 q=0 b q [ G 2 12 ] q , ( 8 ) where d is the dimension of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) .

Because X also commutes with G 2 12 0 = [ G 2 13 , X ] = d−1 q=0 b q [ G 2 13 , ( G 2 12 ) q ] ( 9 )</trash>

Fix a particular trivalent tree graph T expand - ing the vertex and consider a four valent fragment of the graph consisting of an internal edge e , and the four ( internal or external ) edges attached to it ( see Figure 1 ) . The preceeding arguments relating to four valent vertices can be applied directly to this fragment and show that the eigenvalue a T j J of X on |T , j , J is independent of the spin on e . Since this holds for any internal edge of T the eigenvalue is independent of all the internal spins , i . e it has a common value c ∈ C on each element of the basis {|T , j , J} J . Hence X = c1 and the relativistic intertwiner is cP .</p>

				<p>I close with a few observations • The BC model has a simple , physically motivated extension to arbitrary polyhedral complexes ( as opposed to simplicial complexes ) representing spacetime . The generalized BC constraints of definition 1 are equiva - lent to the requirement that relativistic spin networks define equal left and right handed areas for any surface , including ones cutting through vertices . Here the left and right handed areas are determined from the left and right handed spins on the spin network edges and on the vir - tual edges of trivalent tree expansions of the vertices using the the area operator of loop quantum gravity [ RS95 , AL96a , FLR96 ] .</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>[ Rei98 ] it has been shown that GR is a branch of the theory obtained by restricting SO ( 4 ) ( or Spin ( 4 ) ) BF theory to histories in which left handed and right handed areas are equal . That is , the solutions of GR form a branch of the stationary points of the SO ( 4 ) BF action with respect to variations that respect the constraint that left handed areas equal right handed areas . This provides a motivation of the BC model which may be extended to polyhedral complexes : Spin ( 4 ) BF theory is just two non - interacting SU ( 2 ) BF theories , corresponding to SU ( 2 ) L and SU ( 2 ) R respectively . Thus Ooguri &apos; s [ Oog92 ] simplicial lattice sum over histories quantization of SU ( 2 ) BF theory 10 immediately provides a simplicial quantization of Spin ( 4 ) BF theory . The BC model is then obtained from simplicial Spin ( 4 ) BF theory by restricting the histories to ones in which left and right handed areas are equal . A history in the Spin ( 4 ) BF theory defines a Spin ( 4 ) spin network on the boundary of each 4 - simplex ( or more precisely , on the 1 - skeleton of the dual of the boundary seen as a three dimensional simplicial complex ) , which plays the role of boundary data in the sense that the spins and intertwiners of the spin networks on two neighboring 4 - simplices must match in their mutual boundary . The requirement that left and right handed areas be equal then reduces the allowed Spin ( 4 ) spin networks to just relativistic spin networks .</p>

				<p>Ooguri &apos; s quantization of BF theory is most easily generalized to arbi - trary polyhedral complexes in the connection formulation ( see [ Rei97 ] for a detailed discussion ) . In this formulation the boundary data on each 4 - cell is a lattice connection ( of Spin ( 4 ) in our case ) defined by the parallel transport matrices across the 2 - cells separating the 3 - cells of the boundary of the 4 - cell . ( Equivalently , it is a lattice connec - tion on the 1 - skeleton of the dual of the boundary ) . The amplitude of this connection is a delta distribution with support on flat connections . Clearly the sum over histories yields the same states on the boundary of the spacetime ( once infinities stemming from redundancies in the delta functions are factored out ) whether simplices or arbitrary convex polyhedral 4 - cells form the spacetime complex .</p>

				<p>If one transforms the sum over connection boundary data to a sum over spin network boundary data ( see [ Rei97 ] ) one finds , for polyhedral complexes as for simplicial complexes , that the amplitudes of each his - tory is just the product of the evaluations of the spin networks on the 4 - cells , times a factor ( 2j + 1 ) 2 for each 2 - cell , with j = j L = j R the common value of the spins carried by the spin network edges crossing that 2 - cell . Applying the constraint that left areas equal right areas for all surfaces , even ones crossing the vertices of the spin networks , restricts the spin networks on the boundaries of the 4 - cells to be rel - ativistic spin networks in the extended sense of our definition 1 . This defines the generalization of the BC model to polyhedral complexes . • To completely determine the BC sum over histories a normalization has to be chosen for the relativitic intertwiners . The four valent relativis - tic intertwiner given by BC in [ BaCr97 ] seems to be just P . On the other hand , if the sum over histories is to be truly a restriction of the sum over histories for BF theory then the relativistic intertwiner must be normalized in the sense that its contraction on all indices with its complex conjugate must be 1 . Thus it must be P / √ d up to a phase , where d is the dimensionality of Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) .</p>

				<p>corresponding to the basis convention , and the normalized Haar mea - sure is used to integrate over the group . ( 17 ) is precisely the orthogonal projector P on Inv SU ( 2 ) ( j ) . Thus the theorem shows that the unique solution ( mod normalization ) of our generalization of BC &apos; s constraints is Yetter &apos; s extension of their solution . • Since j R is everywhere equal to j L the BC state sum can be viewed as a sum over histories of left handed &quot; fields &quot; , i . e . the j L only . Thus the BC model can be viewed , like the model of [ Rei97 ] as a ( proposal for ) a formulation of quantum GR in terms of &quot; self - dual &quot; variables . ( Note that this does not mean that it is a model of only the self - dual sector of GR , in which the anti - self dual curvature vanishes . It only means that exclusively self - daul variables are used to express the configuration of the gravitational field . )</p>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Proof: The representation matrices D(g L , g R ) of a representation D of SU (2) L × SU (2) R may always be written as D L (g L )D R (g R ) where D L (g L ) = D(g L , 1) and D R (g R ) = D(1, g R ). D L and D R are of course SU (2) representations. The carrying space H of D can thus be decomposed into D L invariant subspaces carrying irreps of SU (2) L . The fact that D L and D R commute, and Shur&apos;s lemma, then imply that D R acts on the subspaces of H carrying the same irrep of SU (2) L , i.e. eigensubspaces of left handed spin. The commutation of D L and D R further implies that when D R is reduced in</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> Trivalent tree bases exist for spin networks of any group for which the product of two irreps is completely reducible.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> If the edge n is incoming then [G n i , G n j ] = iǫ ij k G n k . If the edge is outgoing the negatives −G n i satisfy these commutation relations. The generators belonging to distinct edges of course commute.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> This model is also known as the Crane-Kauffman-Yetter model because Crane, Kauffman , and Yetter [CrYe97] regulated it by q deforming it and were then able to show that the resulting regulated model really defines a continuum (lattice independent) topological field theory.</note>
