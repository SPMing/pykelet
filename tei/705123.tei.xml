			<abstract>
				<p>The production of single charged and neutral intermediate vector bosons in e + e − collisions has been studied in the data collected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 183 and 209 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 640 pb −1. The measured cross-sections for the reactions, determined in limited kinematic regions, are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.</p>

				<p>The production of four-fermion final states becomes increasingly important in e + e − collisions at centre-of-mass energies above the Z pole. The full set of Feynman diagrams must be considered, but particular topologies receive their dominant contribution from a subset of them (cf. Figure 1, taken from reference [1], for the standard definition of the different graphs). As the centre-of-mass energy increases, the dominant processes leading to production of vector bosons are represented by the bremsstrahlung and fusion diagrams with the production of a single vector boson</p>

				<p>the conversion and non-Abelian annihilation diagrams leading to doubly resonant production (e + e − → W + W − , e + e − → ZZ). Single resonant production is dominated by the bremsstrahlung process, which proceeds through the scattering of a quasi-real photon (q 2 γ ∼ 0) radiated from an incoming e − on an e + of the other beam, i.e.: γe + → ¯ ν e W + , γe + → e + Z [2]. The resulting topology is characterized by the e − which radiates the quasi-real photon being predominantly lost along the beam line.</p>

				<p>The integrated luminosity delivered by the LEP collider in the runs at centre-ofmass energies √ s = 183 − 209 GeV (LEP2) allowed, for the first time, measurements of the cross-section of single boson production and not just the observation of individual events. The evaluation of the Standard Model cross-sections for this process requires the computation of the full set of Feynman diagrams and, to deal with the collinear singularity corresponding to the electron lost along the beam line, the use of fully massive matrix elements. Moreover the different scales of the couplings in the process and the scale for the QED initial state radiation (ISR) should be properly accounted for to provide a reliable prediction. Therefore this process was taken as a benchmark when comparing the different calculations used to describe four-fermion physics at LEP2 [3]. In addition, because of the large missing energy in the final state, single boson production is a background when probing for new physics as in the search for the Higgs boson in the Hν ¯ ν channel or for physics beyond the Standard Model [4]. Therefore the measurement of its cross-section is an important check that the background in these searches is correctly modelled. By itself, single-W production provides access to the measurement of the trilinear gauge couplings at the W W γ vertex: this measurement, in combination with other physics channels, has been made by the DELPHI Collaboration and is reported elsewhere [5]. Finally, single boson production is interesting as it will be the dominant source of weak boson production at a forthcoming Linear Collider. Single boson production is investigated in this paper in five different final states: e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ , e − ¯ ν e µ + ν µ and e − ¯ ν e e + ν e for single-W production, e − e + q ¯ q and e − e + µ − µ + for single-Z production. Cross-sections are measured using the data collected by the DELPHI experiment at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 183 to 209 GeV with a corresponding integrated luminosity of about 640 pb −1 . Compared to the results reported by the DELPHI Collaboration in [6], those reported here are based on a larger sample, a better data processing and an improved description of the simulated events (see below). Therefore they update and supersede those already reported in [6]. Results on single boson processes have been published by the other LEP experiments in [7,8] for single-W and in [7–9] for single-Z production.</p>

				<p>The criteria for the selection of the events are mainly based on the information from the tracking system, the calorimeters and the muon chambers of the DELPHI detector. A detailed description of the DELPHI apparatus and its performance can be found in [10].</p>

				<p>The detector has remained essentially unchanged in the LEP2 phase, except for upgrades of the Vertex Detector [11] and the addition of a set of scintillation counters to veto photons in the blind regions of the electromagnetic calorimetry at polar angles 2 θ ≃ 40 • , θ ≃ 90 • and θ ≃ 140 • . The main tracking device was the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). One of the sectors (1/12 of the azimuthal acceptance) of the TPC, hereafter indicated as S6, was not fully operational during the last period of data taking at √ s = 207 GeV (about 50 pb −1 ). The data with the TPC sector down were analysed separately, with the performance of the analysis being evaluated on dedicated simulation samples, where this effect was explicitly taken into account. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the definition of the single boson processes in terms of the four-fermion final states. In Sections 3 and 4 the selection of the events and the extraction of the single-W and single-Z cross-sections are presented. In Section 5 the comparison of measured cross-sections with the predictions of the Standard Model is performed for all the single boson final states.</p>

				<head n="2">Definition of the signal and simulation</head>

				<p>Single boson production is investigated in this paper through four-fermion final states, e − ¯ ν e f ¯ f ′ and e + e − f ¯ f . These final states receive contributions not only from single resonant diagrams but also from doubly resonant production, conversion diagrams and multiperipheral processes (Figure 1, according to the convention of [1]). To enhance the single boson production contribution, and to enable consistent comparisons and combinations between the experiments at LEP, the cross-sections have been defined in the limited kinematic regions described below. eν e W channel: The four-fermion final states e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ and e − ¯ ν e l + ν l (l = µ, τ ) can be produced both via single-W production, referred to as eν e W in the following, or via W -pair production. A distinctive feature of eν e W is the fact that the distribution of the electron direction is strongly peaked at small polar angles (θ e ) with respect to the incoming electron beam direction. Based on this consideration, the eν e W signal was defined by the complete t-channel subset 3 of the Feynman diagrams contributing to the e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ and e − ¯ ν e l + ν l final states with additional kinematic selections to exclude the regions of the phase space dominated by multiperipheral diagrams, where the crosssection calculation is affected by large uncertainties. The signal region was therefore defined as follows:</p>

Single-W production accounts for more than 80% of all e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ and e − ¯ ν e l + ν l events in the kinematic region defined above.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>eν e eν e channel: In the kinematic region with one electron lost in the forward direction, this final state receives, besides single-W production, a large contribution from single-Z production (with Z → ν e ¯ ν e ) and from the interference between single-W and single-Z processes. The contribution of this channel to the eν e W signal was also defined by the complete t-channel subset of the Feynman diagrams, in this case with the following kinematic selections:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>| cos θ e + | &lt; 0.95, E e + &gt; 20 GeV and | cos θ e − | &gt; 0.95. (2) The e − ¯ ν e e + ν e channel was not used in the determination of the single-Z production cross-section. Zee channel: The neutral bosons are produced in the process eγ → eγ * /Z, where a quasi-real photon is radiated from one of the beam electrons and scattered off the other beam.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The signature of such events is an electron in the detector, typically of low energy, recoiling against the γ * /Z system, with the other electron usually lost in the beam-pipe. The Zee cross-section, defined for the combination of the results from all the LEP experiments, refers to the entire set of 48 graphs contributing at tree level to the e + e − f ¯ f (f = q, µ) final state with the following restrictions in the phase space to enhance the single boson contribution 4 :</p>

				<p>motivated by the lower angle of the acceptance for the electron identification of the LEP experiments. At √ s = 200 GeV, within these kinematic limits, the bremsstrahlung contribution accounts for about 97% of e + e − q ¯ q and 67% of e + e − µ + µ − final states. The cut on the invariant mass was set to 60 GeV/c 2 because it both guarantees an efficient rejection of the multiperipheral contribution and it provides a natural separation between the γ * ee and Zee regions, as it corresponds to the minimum of the differential m f ¯ f distribution. This paper presents, for the e + e − q ¯ q final state, besides the above defined Zee crosssection , a measurement of the cross-section with the same acceptance cuts for e + and e − but in the invariant mass range 15 &lt; m q ¯ q &lt; 60 GeV/c 2 (hereafter referred to as γ * ee).</p>

				<head n="3.1">Selection of hadronic events</head>

				<p>The experimental signature of e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ events consists of a pair of acoplanar jets. The undetected neutrino results in a large missing momentum at large angle to the beam direction.</p>

				<p>Other physics processes which can give rise to a similar topology are Z(γ) with Z → q ¯ q, W W events with at least one W decaying into hadrons, other four-fermion final states from neutral current processes 5 (l + l − q ¯ q, ν ¯ νq ¯ q, the latter being topologically identical to the signal) and events induced by two-photon collisions, hereafter called two-photon events. Some of these processes have cross-sections larger than that of the signal by several orders of magnitude. Therefore the analysis was performed in two steps: a preselection of hadronic events and a final selection based on a Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network [20]. A sample of hadronic events was preselected by requiring at least seven charged particles to be measured in the detector. Events from Bhabha scattering were rejected by a cut on the total electromagnetic energy, E EM / √ s &lt; 50%. The contribution from two-photon collisions was reduced by requiring the total visible energy to be larger than 20% of √ s and the total transverse energy, computed as the sum of the moduli of the momenta of each particle projected in the plane transverse to the beam axis, to be at least 15% of √ s. In addition, it was required that the half-opening angle of the cone around the beam axis containing 15% of the visible energy had to be larger than 10 • ; two-photon collision events are concentrated in the forward regions and have low values of this variable. The background from e + e − → q ¯ q(γ) was reduced by requiring the polar angle of the missing momentum to satisfy the condition | cos θ miss | &lt; 0.98 and the acoplanarity 6 to be larger than 10 • . Z(γ) events, with Z → q ¯ q, were further suppressed by vetoing events with electromagnetic clusters with energy larger than 45 GeV or, if the ISR photon escaped undetected in the dead region between the barrel and end-cap electromagnetic calorimeters (θ ∼ 40 • ), by vetoing events with signals in the hermeticity counters in a cone of 30 • around the direction of the missing momentum. Selections on the maximum total multiplicity of charged and neutral tracks ( &lt; 50 ) and on the visible mass (between 30 and 100 GeV/c 2 ) were applied to suppress the residual contamination of multi-jet events from W W or NC processes. Finally, W W events with one W decaying to leptons were suppressed by requiring no identified electron or muon with energy larger than 10% or 7.5% of √ s, respectively. Particles were identified as muons if there was at least one muon chamber hit associated to a track or if the size and longitudinal profile of the energy deposits associated to a track in the hadronic calorimeters were consistent with a minimum ionizing particle. Electron identification was based on the reconstructed showers in the electromagnetic calorimeters associated to charged particle tracks.</p>

				<p>The expected composition of the residual sample after the preselection stage is shown in Table 1, together with the number of selected events at each centre-of-mass energy. At this level of the selection, the fraction of signal events is between 6% and 10% at all the energy points.</p>

				<p>The final selection of e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ events was based on a Neural Network analysis. The input variables were chosen to provide a good separation from the main residual backgrounds after preselection. The first set of variables, listed below, discriminated the signal from q ¯ q(γ) events:</p>

				<p>Distributions of some of these variables, at √ s = 200 GeV, are shown in Figure 2.</p>

The distribution of the Neural Network output variable is shown in Figure 3. The whole data sample is included in the plot.

				<p>A large residual contamination was still present, due to cosmic-ray events in the muon channel and to Compton scattering of a radiated photon in the electron channel. The former were suppressed by tightening the selections on the track impact parameters to |IP Rφ | &lt; 0.2 cm and |IP z | &lt; 2 cm for the muons. Compton scattering can mimic the W + → e + ν e signal when the photon balancing the electron in the transverse plane is lost in the dead region between the barrel and forward electromagnetic calorimeters. Therefore events were rejected if a signal was found in the hermeticity counters at an azimuthal angle larger than 90 • from the electron. The distributions in data and simulation of the momentum of selected single muons and of the energy of selected single electrons are shown in Figure 4. The performance of the analysis at the various centre-of-mass energy values and the results obtained are reported in Tables 3 and 4, respectively, for the e − ¯ ν e µ + ν µ and e − ¯ ν e e + ν e channels. Due to the low statistics of selected events only the upper limits of cross-sections at 95% C.L. are given for each individual energy point. The limits were derived following a Bayesian approach from the integration of the Poissonian probabilities constructed with the number of events selected in the data and predicted in the simulation. For the electron channel a difference was found for efficiencies and backgrounds corresponding to the two periods at √ s = 207 GeV with TPC sector S6 on or off, and in Table 4 the weighted averages of the two are shown. Compatible values were found for the muon channel. 3.3 Study of systematic uncertainties The main source of systematic uncertainty in the present measurement is the knowledge of the background level in the selected samples.

					<figDesc>, in the hadronic channel selection there is an excess of data of ( 5±2 ) % with respect to the expectation at the preselection stage , at which the sample consists mainly of background events . Rescaling the background at the final stage of the selection by this factor leads to an average decrease of 69±28 fb of the measured cross - section . This was considered as a systematic error fully correlated between the energy points . The correction factor added to the background cross - section , accounting for the excess of real data in the region 50 GeV / c 2 &lt; M vis · √ s / E vis &lt; 60 GeV / c 2 , was known with a statistical uncertainty of ±10 fb . This leads to a systematic error on σ eνqq ′ of ±26 fb , fully correlated between the energy points . Possible inaccuracies in the modelling of background processes were evaluated by com - paring different Monte Carlo generators . The only effect was found in the q ¯ q ( γ ) channel : using the ARIADNE [ 23 ] event generator instead of PYTHIA , the background estimate was 508±14 fb instead of 502±7 fb in the final e − ¯ ν e q ¯ q ′ sample selected at 200 GeV . The largest of the statistical errors of the ARIADNE and PYTHIA samples was taken as a systematic error . The total systematic error on the background cross - section , due to the modelling of q ¯ q ( γ ) process and to the limited simulation statistics ( see Table 2</figDesc>

The uncertainty on the efficiency of the electron identification , ε e , was estimated by comparing a sample of Bhabha events in data and simulation . The discrepancy was at the level of 2% . The trigger efficiency for the leptonic events is known with an error better than 1% . This leads to a systematic error negligible compared to the other sources considered .

				<p>with | cos θ e | &lt; 0 . 985 , corresponding to the acceptance of the DELPHI &apos; s forward and barrel electromagnetic calorimeters ; • in events with more than one reconstructed electromagnetic shower , the energy of the second most energetic shower was required to be less than 0 . 6E beam . This condition was imposed in order to reject events from Bhabha scattering .</p>

				<p>The electron candidates were then retained if they satisfied the following criteria : • in the barrel region ( 42 • &lt; θ &lt; 138 • ) , the track parameters were required to be con - sistent with those of the shower measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter , with the additional requirement , for showers with energy higher than 30 GeV , that the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter did not exceed 10% of that deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter ; • in the forward region ( 10 • &lt; θ &lt; 32 • and 148 • &lt; θ &lt; 170 • ) , the energy of the shower , reconstructed by re - clustering the energy deposits compatible with a single electro - magnetic shower , was required to be compatible with the momentum of exactly one track measured in DELPHI &apos; s vertex detector and very forward tracker , and with the momentum of no more than one track measured in the inner detector and TPC ( see [ 10 , 11 ] ) for detailed description of these detectors ) ;</p>

				<p>The search was restricted to events with γ * / Z going into a µ + µ − pair with invariant mass above 60 GeV / c 2 . The general features are the same as for the hadronic channel with jets replaced by muons . Thus a three - track signature , of two high - momentum muons and one e + or e − , scattered at large angle , is expected in the detector . The signal selection criteria on angular distributions were similar to those used in the hadronic channel .</p>

					<figDesc>Number of events expected from the contributions of different channels and observed in the data at different stages of the γ * / Zee selection ( leptonic channel ) for the different years of data taking . The column labelled &quot; ( e + e − µ + µ − ) bkg &quot; shows the numbers for the background events coming from all processes with e + e − µ + µ − in the final state not fulfilling the signal definition criteria . All other background sources are collected inside the column labelled &quot; Others &quot; . The sum of the charges of the three particles was required to be ±1 . Possible photon conversions were removed according to the procedure described in [ 10 ] and requiring in addition the minimum opening angle of any track pair to be larger than 5 • . Since the event topology is simple , the particle identification required at least two tracks to be identified as leptons ( µ or e ) and at least one of them to be a muon . For muon identification loose criteria were applied , as in the case of single - W production ( see Section 3 . 2 ) . The flavour of the possible unidentified track was inferred from partial information taking into account the combination of the charges of the observed particles .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In the case of µ + x − e ± or x + µ − e ± , the unidentified track x was treated as µ . For µ + µ − x ± the track x was taken as e ± . Since the efficiency of the identification of the electrons was smaller than for the muons , a majority of events with the µ + µ − pair detected and an unidentified electron was accepted this way . This reduced dramatically the sensitivity of event selection , and hence the loss of efficiency , to the efficiency of electron identification ( less than 5% drop of signal selection efficiency was observed after forcing the electron track to be always unidentified ) . Events with two tracks identified as electrons were rejected . At the preselection stage , the momentum of the e ± candidate had to be greater than 2 GeV / c , and the invariant mass of the µ + µ − pair greater than 20 GeV / c 2 .</p>

				<p>Due to the stringent cut on low multiplicity of the event , the data reduction factor was large . For all energy points , 88 events were preselected and 94 . 0±0 . 6 events were expected . At this stage most of the events came from other neutral current four - fermion processes with e + e − µ + µ − in the final state but outside the kinematic limits of the signal definition ( see Table 10 ) . The remaining contributions came mainly from the neutral current four - fermion processes ( e</p>

				</figure>

				<p>A kinematic fit was performed before applying the final selection cuts to the data . An electron lost along the beam line and no missing momentum in the transverse plane were assumed . The invariant mass of the µ + µ − pair was recalculated if the probability of the kinematic fit was above 0 . 001 . The high purity of this channel implies that events with lower fit probability still correspond to e + e − µ + µ − production , but with a poorly measured visible electron ; such events were therefore retained and the original uncorrected µ + µ − invariant mass was kept . In agreement with the signal definition the µ + µ − invariant mass was then required to be greater than 60 GeV / c 2 , the momentum of the observed electron greater than 3 GeV / c and its polar angle θ e to satisfy the condition Q e cos θ e &gt; −0 . 5 , with Q e being the charge of the observed electron .</p>

				<p>Finally the allowed angular ranges for the direction of the Z / γ * momentum and missing momentum were defined by the following conditions : • Q e cos θ µ + µ − &lt; −0 . 8 , with θ µ + µ − being the polar angle of the µ + µ − system ; • Q e cos θ miss &gt; 0 . 8 , with θ miss being the polar angle of the missing momentum com - puted before the kinematic fit .</p>

				<p>After the final selection the background contribution is expected to be less than 10% of the total selected events . The remaining background from processes with e + e − µ + µ − in the final state which was dominant at the preselection level was reduced to about 1% .</p>

				<p>The efficiency of the selection of the signal , the expected background and the number of selected events in the data for all centre - of - mass energies are reported in Table 9 . Due to the low statistics of selected events only the upper limits of cross - sections at 95% C . L . are given for each individual energy point . The limits were derived following a Bayesian approach from the integration of the Poissonian probabilities constructed with the number of events selected in the data and predicted in the simulation . In total 13 events were selected and 8 . 3±0 . 1 events were expected from data in the energy range from 183 GeV to 207 GeV . The µ + µ − invariant mass distribution is shown in Figure 6 . The distributions of the energy and of the signed angle , Q e cos θ e , of the tag electron after the kinematic fit for hadronic and µ + µ − events with m f ¯ f &gt; 60 GeV / c 2 , are shown in Figure 7 summed over all the centre - of - mass energies . The observed spectra are in agreement with the predictions from the simulation .</p>

				<head n="4">. 3 Systematic uncertainties</head>

				<p>The measurement uncertainty is dominated by the limited real data statistics .</p>

				<p>In the hadronic channel three sources of systematic errors were considered : the effi - ciency in the electron selection procedure , the modelling of the contribution from two - photon events , which represents the largest background component in the low invariant mass region , and the modelling of the fragmentation in the q ¯ q ( γ ) contribution , which represents the largest background component in the high invariant mass region . The uncertainty on the efficiency of the electron identification was estimated by com - paring the number of selected events in the data and in the simulation for a sample enriched in W W events ( about 85% purity ) with at least one of the two W &apos; s decaying , directly or in cascade , into a final state containing an electron . The same criteria for electron identification and isolation were adopted as in the Zee analysis , but the signal selection criteria were changed to maximize the product efficiency times purity of the W W selection . Assuming the Standard Model prediction for the W W cross - section , includ - ing the O ( α ) electroweak corrections via the so - called Leading Pole Approximation [ 3 ] , and attributing the entire discrepancy between the observed and the expected number of events to the different electron identification efficiency in the data and in the simulation , the relative difference in the efficiency was found to be ∆ε e / ε e = ( −2 . 2 ± 3 . 6 ) % where the error accounts both for the data and the simulation statistics . The error on the difference was used for the computation of the systematic error .</p>

				<p>The uncertainty in modelling of two - photon events could arise from the bad modelling either of the direct or of the resolved photon contribution . As described in [ 18 ] , in the region of single tag the direct component was simulated using the WPHACT generator and the resolved component using PYTHIA 6 . 143 . To match the direct and resolved components in the region m q ¯ q &lt; 40 GeV / c 2 the WPHACT generator was run with constituent quark masses . The direct component of single tag events with m q ¯ q &gt; 40 GeV / c 2 was instead simulated with the WPHACT generator using current algebra quark masses . To gauge the effect of the different quark masses for the single tag low mass direct component , a fully simulated sample with current algebra quark masses only was used to evaluate the effect both on signal efficiency and on the background cross - section . The change in the quark mass does not affect the γ * / Zee signal at any stage of the selection , while the background at the end of the selection is increased by about 5 fb in each invariant mass region . Concerning the resolved photon component , at √ s = 200 GeV the cross - section of this background amounts , at the generator level , to about 10 fb in the γ * ee signal region and 17 fb in the Zee one . A different generator , TWOGAM [ 25 ] , predicts background cross - sections of 5 fb and 9 fb , respectively , in these two regions . As the topologies of the resolved photon and γ * / Zee events are similar , the same selection efficiency was assumed for this background and the signal . Therefore the difference between the PYTHIA and TWOGAM predictions at the generator level , which is stable in the range √ s = 183 − 207 GeV , was taken as systematic error on the measured cross - section . The uncertainty in modelling the fragmentation and hadronization in q ¯ q ( γ ) events was evaluated using a simulation sample produced with the ARIADNE generator . The background cross - sections were found to be larger , but within the statistical error , leading to a decrease of the measured cross - sections of 3±5 fb in the low invariant mass region and 7±13 fb in the high invariant mass one . The largest of the statistical errors from the ARIADNE and PYTHIA samples , 3 fb in the γ * ee signal region and 9 fb in the Zee one , were taken as systematic error . These three systematic uncertainties , together with the error on the luminosity , were taken as fully correlated at the different centre - of - mass energies , while the errors on the background cross - section and on the signal efficiency due to the limited simulation statistics were considered uncorrelated among the different energies .</p>

				<p>The contributions of the sources of systematic uncertainty in the hadronic channel at 189 GeV are summarized in Table 11 . The total systematic uncertainty amounts to ±10% in the region 15 &lt; m q ¯ q &lt; 60 GeV / c 2 and to ±6% for m q ¯ q &gt; 60 GeV / c 2 .</p>

				<p>The contributions of the different sources of systematic errors in the leptonic channel are summarized in Table 12 .</p>

				<p>The main source of systematic error is the limited simulation statistics , both for the signal and for the background . The effect of the uncertainty on the efficiency of the electron identification was measured to be negligible using relaxed iden - tification criteria . The total systematic uncertainty amounts to about ±5% per energy point . Assuming no energy correlation of the systematic errors , the overall systematic uncertainty on the energy averaged cross - section was estimated to be ±2 . 5% , an order of magnitude smaller than the statistical uncertainty .</p>

				<head n="5">Combined single boson cross - sections</head>

				<p>The measured values for single boson cross - sections are compared with the Standard Model predictions obtained with WPHACT [ 12 ] as a function of the centre - of - mass en - ergy . This dependency is shown in Figure 8 for single - W and single - Z production . The theoretical uncertainty on the predictions amounts to 5% . The overall compatibility with the Standard Model was checked by considering the ratio R of the measured to the predicted cross - sections . At each energy point a Poissonian probability function was constructed based on the number of observed events , the number of expected background events and the signal extraction efficiency . A maximum likelihood fit to the data of the global probability function , being the product over all probability functions for individ - ual energies convoluted with a multidimensional Gaussian describing the correlated and uncorrelated systematic errors , was performed . The results were :</p>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In the reference frame used in DELPHI the z axis was oriented along the incoming e − beam, θ indicated the polar angle and φ the azimuthal angle. 3 The t-channel subset consists of the bremsstrahlung, fusion and multiperipheral diagrams of Figure 1.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Single-W analysis Both the hadronic and the leptonic final states were considered in the single-W analysis . They are characterized by the presence of two hadronic jets acoplanar with the beam or by a single lepton with large transverse momentum, respectively. The final state electron is lost in the beam pipe. 4 Diagrams involving Higgs boson exchange are neglected. Multiperipheral processes with at least one photon resolved are excluded from the signal definition even if they are within the accepted kinematic region.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> The definition of neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) four-fermion processes of Ref. [19] are used throughout the text. 6 Acoplanarity is defined as the supplement of the angle between the projections of the two hadronic jets in the plane transverse to the beam direction.</note>
