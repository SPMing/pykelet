				<p>We investigate early time inflationary scenarios in an Universe filled with a dilute noncommutative bosonic gas at high temperature. A noncommutative bosonic gas is a gas composed of bosonic scalar field with noncommutative field space on a commutative spacetime. Such noncommutative field theories was recently introduced as a generalization of quantum mechanics on a noncommutative spacetime. As key features of these theories are Lorentz invariance violation and CPT violation. In the present study we use a noncommutative bosonic field theory that besides the noncommutative parameter θ shows up a further parameter σ. This parameter σ controls the range of the noncommutativity and acts as a regulator for the theory. Both parameters play a key role in the modified dispersion relations of the noncommutative bosonic field, leading to possible striking consequences for phenomenology. In this work we obtain an equation of state p = ω(σ, θ; β)ρ for the noncommutative bosonic gas relating pressure p and energy density ρ, in the limit of high temperature. We analyse possible behaviours for this gas parameters σ, θ and β, so that −1 ≤ ω &lt; −1/3, which is the region where the Universe enters an accelerated phase.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Quantum Field Theories (QFT) with Lorentz invariance violation are subject of growing attention among theoretical physicists in the last few years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Indeed, there is no reason a priori to believe that the cosmological principle 1 is true at all energy scales.</p>

				<p>Further analysis on the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry [7], ultra high energy cosmic rays [8, 9, 10], primordial magnetic field [11], neutrino physics [12] and some other cosmological measurements demands further criticisms on the cosmology principle at ultra high energy scale. Therefore the proposal of validity/bound tests for the cosmology principle , i.e., cosmological phenomenology based upon QFT with Lorentz invariance violation is a subject of major relevance. There are distinct approaches to QFT with Lorentz invariance violation. A first approach is based on the noncommutativity of spacetime itself. The most studied situation was that of QFTs on the Groenenwold-Moyal [13, 14]. Some of these models may be obtained from a fundamental theory such as string/M-theory [14]. Recently [15, 16, 17], it was shown that one could restore Lorentz invariance of these QFT by a proper twisting of the action of the symmetry group on the fields. Cosmology applications of this twisted Lorentz invariant QFT is recently being under study [18]. There is also an interesting approach based on using a noncommutative version of Wheeler-deWitt equation, where the noncommutativity is introduced as a Moyal deformation [19].</p>

				<p>A second approach is known as extended standard model [3]. It is based on a famous work of S. Carroll, R. Jackiw and G. Field [20]. In this approach the breaking of Lorentz invariance is performed by the introduction of a Chern-Simons term on the action of some gauge theory 2 . One should also mention the approach known as doubly special relativity [22]. Another approach, the one we are going to consider in this paper, is QFT based on noncommutative fields [25, 24, 38]. On such theories one breaks Lorentz invariance by modifying the canonical commutation relations of the fields (therefore the name noncommutative fields) by the inclusion of an ultraviolet or/and infrared scale factor. These noncommutative fields arise as a generalization of the quantum mechanics on the Groenenwold-Moyal plane [23], where one considers the noncommutativity in the degrees of freedom of the fields. One interesting feature of such theories is that there is a connection of this approach with Carroll et al proposal [20] for gauge theories. See for instance [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].</p>

				<p>One common feature of all these theories with Lorentz invariance broken is the deformation of the dispersion relations of the plane waves. It is this deformation that allows one to build phenomenological models that could be in principle be tested in future cosmology or particle physics experiments. The kind of deformation to be seen or ruled out by these experiments will thus decide which theory will survive. The most promising arena for these phenomenological models is the inflationary scenario of the Universe. Models based on the Universe inflation has successfully explained several observational data, such as the origin of density fluctuations on large scales. The general belief is that inflation that supports large and fast growth of scales can connect the region where the Lorentz invariance might break (i.e., at very high energy) to cosmological scales. On the other hand, it is known that so far there is no explanation of the essential mechanisms of inflation based on fundamental physics such as string/M-theory.</p>

				<p>In the context of inflationary scenarios based on QFT with Lorentz invariance violation, based on the noncommutativity of space-time, several developments have been put forward recently [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. In these works several efforts have been made in the direction of finding imprints of primordial fluctuations that can survive the inflationary phase. Such imprints have been investigated both in theories with [35] and without [33] inflaton fields. See [37] and references therein for a recent review on this subject.</p>

				<p>In the present paper, we consider the approach based on noncommutative fields as studied by A. P. Balachandran et al. in [38]. In that work a noncommutative free massless bosonic field was studied. For that theory, they considered a regularization of the delta function appearing in one of the commutators of the fields. The equal time commutation relation for the fields then reads ϕ a (x; t), ˆ ϕ b (y; t) = iǫ ab θ(σ; x − y), (1.1) where θ(σ; x − y) is a Gaussian distribution with a parameter σ related with the standard deviation of the distribution. Besides introducing one further parameter σ, the resulting theory is finite. That fact allowed the study of the deformed black body radiation spectrum.</p>

				<p>One interesting feature of this deformed spectrum is that the energy density for boson with higher frequency is greater than that for the usual black body radiation spectrum. We investigate here an inflationary model based on an Universe filled with a similar gas composed of a noncommutative boson in the relativistic limit. In this scenario we study the thermodynamics of such gas. We aim at computing and analyzing the equation of state p = ωρ, with p being the pressure, ρ being the energy density. In the present situation this equation of state is far from trivial. Therefore we have to make some careful approximations, such as considering a power series of the parameters θ and temperature 1/β. Now, for suitable values of the parameters θ, σ and the temperature 1/β of the gas, one obtain −1 ≤ ω &lt; −1/3. For these values of ω the Universe presents an accelerated phase. Furthermore, the present case should be contrasted with the tachyon and Chaplygin cosmology that is governed by an equation of state given by the general form p = −A/ρ [39], since here the inflationary regime is followed by a radiation dominated epoch for sufficiently small density ρ.</p>

				<p>The present paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 we review the formulation of the free noncommutative boson field as presented in Balachandran et al. The goal is to obtain the Hamiltonian for such noncommutative field so that we may formulate a statistical quantum mechanics problem for the gas at high temperature; in Sec. 3 we study the gas of noncommutative bosons in the grand canonical formalism. Then by some suitable approximations, we obtain an equation of state p = ω(σ, θ; β)ρ for this gas; in Sec. 4 we consider a cosmology model with the noncommutative gas by presenting the proper Friedman equation and then the behavior of the energy density of this gas with the scale parameter. Next we consider, by fine tuning the parameters, possible scenarios yielding inflation; finally in Sec. 5 we finish the paper with some concluding remarks.</p>

				<p>In this section we review the theory [38] of massless spinless noncommutative bosonic scalar field on a (3 + 1)-d commutative base space. We consider a commutative R 2 as target space so that ϕ :</p>

				<p>In the sequel we will assume that each spatial direction is compactified into S 1 with radius R. Besides making the analysis easier, this choice of topology of the space will be immaterial, since we will be interested in the thermodynamic limit, so that V ∼ R 3 → ∞. We write the field components ϕ i (</p>

				<p>The Lagrangian for the massless spinless boson is given by</p>

				<p>Observe that the usual commutative theory is obtained via θ → 0. The novelty of the work of [38] was to regularise the delta function in the commutation relation (2.9). This proved to be useful in the study of the spectrum of the deformed blackbody radiation, where it prevented the energy density to diverge with respect to frequency.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Thus, in (2.9) we replace θ(σ) ≡ θ(σ; x − y) = θδ(x − y) by θ(σ) = θ ( √ 2πσ) 3 exp − 3 i=1 (x i − y i ) 2 2σ 2 , (2.12) where we make the simplifying assumption σ 1 = σ 2 = σ 3 = σ in the more general expression 3 i=1 (x i −y i ) 2 2σ 2 i for the argument of the exponential. The delta function in commutation relation (2.11) is not regularized. We now write the noncommutative fields ϕ a ( x, t) in Fourier modes as (2.2), i.e., ˆ ϕ a ( x, t) = n e 2πi R n· x ˆ ϕ a n . (2.13) – 4 – Furthermore, θ(σ) may be written as θ( n) = θ e − 2π 2 σ 2 | n| 2 R 2 , (2.14) so that the Dressed transformation are now written as ˆ ϕ a n = ϕ a n − 1 2R 3 ǫ ab θ(n)π b −n , (2.15) ˆ π a n = π a n .

				<p>We observe that the dispersion relation of these bosons have been modified. However, if we take the limit θ → 0, then we recover the usual dispersion relations.

				<head n="3">Noncommutative Field Gas</head>

				<p>In this section, we formulate the quantum statistical mechanics problem for the noncommutative field gas in a volume V ∼ R 3 , in order to study its thermodynamics at some approximation level. The gas is regarded as a free relativistic (E ≃ p) boson gas that may have dominated the evolution of the hot early Universe during some time. We use the Hamiltonian defined in Eq. (2.23) into the grand partition function determined as</p>

				<p><formula>Ξ = Tre −β(H−µ) = k =0 ∞ m,n=0 e −β(ω k Λ 1 k −µ)n e −β(ω k Λ 2 k −µ)m = k =0 1 1 − ze −βω k Λ 1 k 1 1 − ze −βω k Λ 2 k , (3.1)</formula></p>

				<p>where we have omitted the summation on the zero mode since it is related to the translation of the system. Note that z = e βµ is the &apos;fugacity&apos;, with µ being a constant chemical potential.</p>

				<p>In the rest of the paper we shall mainly use thermodynamics quantities that can be found through the following useful function</p>

Given the complexity of the quantum statistical mechanics problem formulated for the noncommutative field gas, it is hard to tackle the problem exactly. Thus let us consider the limit of high temperature of a dilute gas (z ≪ 1). At this regime we can easily approximate the equation (3.2) to the simpler equation</figDesc>

				<p>The integral (3.7) is still hard to evaluate because of the nontrivial dependence of Λ i (k) in k and the parameter θ.

				<p>Here we aim at finding equation of state p = ωρ, from which one can study possible inflationary scenarios.

				<p>One should note that for sufficiently large σ, sufficiently small θ or sufficiently small β one finds ω(σ, θ; β) = 1/3, which corresponds to the radiation dominated regime. It is the minus sign appearing in front of the third term in r.h.s. of Eq. (3.15) that allows one to find −1 ≤ ω &lt; −1/3, which is a region of accelerated expansion of an Universe filled with this noncommutative gas.</p>

				<p>The Friedmann equation governing the evolution of a flat (k = 0) Universe is given by</p>

				<p><formula>˙ a a 2 = 8πG 3 ρ, (4.1)</formula></p>

				<p>where ρ is the energy density of several species (for instance, ρ radiation , ρ matter and so on) contributing to the energy density of the Universe and G is the Newton constant. For a noncommutative field gas dominated epoch, the energy density for this gas, i.e., ρ ncg in the r.h.s. of the Friedmann equation is the dominant species component. By using the equation of conservation of energy density</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>˙ ρ ncg = −3 ˙ a a (ρ ncg + p ncg ), (4.2) we find ρ ncg ∝ a −3(1+ω) . (4.3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The regime with ω = −1 clearly produces ρ ncg ∝ const., which means an exponential expansion.</p>

				<p>In the sequel we are going to use the construction of section 3 together with the above Friedmann equation with the noncommutative gas dominant species component in order to consider some possible inflationary scenarios. Before that let us summarize what are our ingredients and what are the expected features of an inflationary scenario in the present set-up. We consider an Universe filled with a dilute noncommutative gas at high temperature described by the quantity ω(σ, θ; β) given by Eq. (3.15). We observe that this noncommutative gas is in principle labelled by three parameters, i.e, σ, θ and β, each of which we may be taken either fixed or variable. For inflation to happen, these parameters should be so that ω &lt; −1/3. We also find interesting to demand the fields not to be tachyonic, so that we are going to impose −1 ≤ ω.</p>

				<p>The parameter θ is related to the intensity of the noncommutativity. The bigger its value, the bigger the noncommutativity. The parameter σ is related to the range of the noncommutativity. Now, if θ → 0, the noncommutativity disappears. Also if σ → ∞, the noncommutativity becomes negligible. One may easily verify these statements by analysing Eq. (1.1) together with Eq. (2.12). Now, we observe that if either θ or σ are dynamical variables, then we should look after a dynamical theory to describe these physical objects. Although we will analyse situations with σ and/or θ varying, we will not make statements based on a still to be found dynamical theory for these variables. The parameter β is related to the inverse of the temperature of the noncommutative gas.</p>

				<p>The inflationary scenarios to be considered in the present set-up should have some special features and requirements. A first requirement is to see whether the gas can enter and/or exit the inflationary regime −1 ≤ ω &lt; −1/3. Of course, we expect the Universe to enter and then to exit this regime, i.e., one wants to avoid eternal inflation. Next we are interested on how the temperature will behave during inflation. Furthermore, we surely expect either the noncommutative gas to be turned off or its influence on Friedmann equation be negligible at some time after exiting inflation. For instance, after inflation it would be desirable to have a hot Universe in radiation dominated phase.</p>

				<p>Having these informations, we may proceed to engineering of some inflationary scenar- ios.</p>

				<p>Now let&apos;s assume β to be fixed, so that σ(ρ) ∼ 1 ρ 1/6 (see (3.11)). Thus, at very high energy density in the early Universe the &apos;compounds&apos; of the noncommutative field gas feel a very large noncommutative influence due to very small range σ among them. As the Universe expands the energy density ρ decreases and the range σ increases so that the gas passes through the radiation dominated regime ω(σ, θ, β) = 1/3. After that, the gas enters in the accelerated regime — see the lower curve and delimited shaded region depicted in the – 9 – left panel of the Fig. 1. Finally, the gas achieves again the radiation dominated regime as σ becomes sufficiently large — see Eq. (3.15). Furthermore, the noncommutativity becomes negligible as σ increases in this scenario. This is the expected scenario that should occurs in any model of inflation. However, there is a fundamental difference in our scenario described above, that is the fact we have fixed both the temperature (1/β) and θ. This scenario clearly does not exhibit either cooling or reheating phases in the Universe during the inflationary regime. This last feature is typical of warm inflation [40, 41].</p>

				<p>At the critical point (i.</p>

Left Panel: θ = 2.2 10 −14 , the curves are obtained numerically in such a way that their minima are located at ω = −1 and ω = −1/3 for the lower and upper curves (s = 1.8 10 64 and s = 2.1 10 64 ) respectively. Right panel shows that increasing θ the minimum of ω is displaced to larger σ (later limes). Curves are depicted for s = 1.8 10 64 , θ = 2.2 10 −14 (left) and s = 1.2 10 64 , θ = 2.4 10 −14 (right). Pattern filled regions are not covered by any lines. Shading represents contour lines for constant β, lighter regions mean greater θ (and smaller temperature).</p>

				<p>Now we assume β as variable. In this case we may have very distinct variations of temperature. In particular, one interesting possibility we are going to analyse here is the adiabatic expansion of the Universe. Therefore, in this case the molar entropy (3.14) is constant.</p>

				<p>In this scenario, as the Universe expands adiabatically, its temperature initially increases — see Fig. 2.</p>

				<head>– 10 –</head>

				<p>Then depending on the value of θ, it enters in an inflation regime (ω &lt; −1/3). In that regime the Universe keeps cooling until it reaches a minimum value for ω. After that it starts to reheat until it leaves out the inflation regime. Therefore just after inflation the Universe is hot. One may even observe that some time after inflation the Universe starts to cool again. Also at some point the noncommutativity will be negligible, since σ is increasing and θ is fixed. The most interesting feature of this scenario is that the Universe shows up a cooling and then reheating phase as σ increases (or equivalently, ρ decreases). However, this scenario is the most difficult to analyze analytically and we had to rely on numerical calculations. A common feature of both above scenarios is that increasing θ moves the minimum of the ω function to greater values of σ and consequently later times. Since inflation time is deeply connected to the position of this minimum, locating the inflation era fixes the value of θ, which can be cross-checked with other empirical bounds for the strength of the noncommutativity.</p>

				<head n="5">Conclusions</head>

				<p>In this paper we have used noncommutative fields to find cosmological scenarios that can develop inflation at early Universe. A gas composed with a noncommutative bosonic field shows up several interesting properties. In particular, in the dilute regime at high temperature, these properties can be read off from Eq. (3.15).</p>

				<p>The aim of the paper was essentially to find the equation of state of the gas by tackling approximately the statistical quantum mechanics problem for the noncommutative field gas at high temperature. Since we are dealing with highly relativistic bosons not necessarily massless, the approximate relation between energy and momenta E ≃ p used along the paper is valid. This in turn is consistent with the formulation of free massless boson with noncommutative target space adopted previously. The grand canonical ensemble – 12 – used in the quantum statistical formulation is also valid because, on the other hand, the masslessness of the bosons is just an approximation.</p>

				<p>The noncommutative field gas we are dealing with here can develop inflation for a period of time that can be adjusted to observational data. We showed some scenarios that exit inflation phase to a radiation dominated epoch, as it should be according to the perspective of the inflationary cosmology. This feature is certainly a motivation for further studies of these scenarios. In particular, the scenarios with θ fixed.</p>

				<p>In scenarios with σ and β fixed, we are left with only the parameter θ free to be determined for a given temperature in Eq. (4.5). Let us estimate the value of θ for T = 10 14 GeV ≃ 10 27 K, the approximate temperature at beginning of the inflation, for ω min ≥ −1 and ω min &lt; −1/3, respectively θ −1 ≥ 0.4 × 10 −25 cm, θ −1/3 &lt; 0.5 × 10 −25 cm. (5.1)</p>

				<p>This result should be contrasted with other astrophysical bounds on the parameter θ. For instance, in [25], it was estimated a value for θ to be of the order of (10 20 eV ) −1 ≃ 10 −25 cm.</p>

				<p>They have used the fact that the highest cosmic ray energy be no greater than ∼ 10 20 eV .</p>

				<p>Recall that the GZK cutoff is of the order of 10 19 eV . Furthermore, as we can easily see above, there is a short range for θ that allows for inflation in these scenarios. A proper understanding of the nature of the parameter σ, for instance, a dynamical theory for it, could shed more light on these developments. Further possibilities may arise if one consider other kinds of regularization for the delta function in (2.9).</p>

				<p>Several other interesting issues such as the implications of the sound speed and the density perturbations can also be investigated to know in what extent the model is in accordance with CMB data. One can estimate the adiabatic sound speed by using</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>c 2 s = ∂P ∂ρ S,N = − V 2 m 0 N ∂P ∂V S,N , (5.2)</trash>

					<figDesc>with ρ = m/V = m 0 N/V . Once we have previously assumed a dilute gas (z ≪ 1) at high temperature, then by using eqs.(3.4)-(3.6) one can easily show that the gas satisfies P V = N T . The sound speed is then given by</figDesc>
					<trash>c s = T m 0 , (5.3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where m 0 is the mass of ultra relativistic bosons satisfying E 2 = m 2 0 + p 2 ≃ p 2 . So, at first order in z, the approximation maintained throughout this work, the sound speed does not depend on non-commutative parameters. The first correction comes from higher orders in z expansion which can be computed quite easily to be:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>T 1 − 7 z 64 m 0 + 91 z θ 2 16384 m 0 π 2 T 3 σ 6 + z log(z) 64 m 0 T . (5.4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Since in this work we consider the high temperature limit, in which we can disregard the mass, further analysis on the speed of sound cannot be pursued. We let further studies related to this issue for future investigations, together with the low temperature limit.</p>
