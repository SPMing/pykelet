				<p>Some ideas are presented concerning the question which of the harmonic wavefunctions constructed in [hep-th/9909191] may be annihilated by all supercharges. In an attempt to extend our knowledge about the asymptotic form of zero-energy wave functions of SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix models beyond N = 2, it was recently shown [1], for N = 3, how to construct Weyl ⊗ Spin(d) invariant asymptotic states out of the Cartan-subalgebra degrees of freedom. To find out which of these harmonic wavefunctions is annihilated by the asymptotic supercharges [2] Q β = −iγ t βα ∇ tk Θ αk (1) t = 1,. .. , d = (2), 3, 5 or 9 α, β = 1,. .. , s d = 2, 4, 8 resp. 16 k = 1, 2 is non-trivial. The &quot; guess &quot; presented in this note will hopefully be a first step 1. Should the answer really be that for arbitrary N , already for this &quot; free &quot; problem, exactly one supersymmetric state exists for d = 9 (and none for d = 2, 3, 5), this should obviously have a &quot; simple &quot; (deep?) mathematical explanation, of more general relevance. Each harmonic state, constructed in [1], has the form Ψ = l,S,R,m r −2l−2(d−1) ¯ Ψ S×R lm (x 1 , x 2)|S × R; m (2) with l=0,1,.. . , ¯ Ψ S×R lm a harmonic polynomial of degree l (in the variables x 1 , x 2 ; r := x 2 1 + x 2 2) transforming under the Weyl-group (the permutation group S 3) and Spin(d) according to the irreducible representation S(= 1, ∈ or ρ), cf.

				<p>In an attempt to extend our knowledge about the asymptotic form of zeroenergy wave functions of SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix models beyond N = 2, it was recently shown [1], for N = 3, how to construct Weyl ⊗ Spin(d) invariant asymptotic states out of the Cartan-subalgebra degrees of freedom. To find out which of these harmonic wavefunctions is annihilated by the asymptotic supercharges [2] Q β = −iγ t βα ∇ tk Θ αk (1) t = 1, . . . , d = (2), 3, 5 or 9 α, β = 1, . . . , s d = 2, 4, 8 resp. 16 k = 1, 2 is non-trivial. The &quot; guess &quot; presented in this note will hopefully be a first step 1 .</p>

				<p>Should the answer really be that for arbitrary N , already for this &quot; free &quot; problem, exactly one supersymmetric state exists for d = 9 (and none for d = 2, 3, 5), this should obviously have a &quot; simple &quot; (deep?) mathematical explanation, of more general relevance. Each harmonic state, constructed in [1], has the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Ψ = l,S,R,m r −2l−2(d−1) ¯ Ψ S×R lm (x 1 , x 2 )|S × R; m (2) with l=0,1,. . . , ¯ Ψ S×R lm a harmonic polynomial of degree l (in the variables x 1 , x 2 ; r := x 2 1 + x 2 2 ) transforming under the Weyl-group (the permutation group S 3 ) and Spin(d) according to the irreducible representation S(= 1, ∈ or ρ), cf. [1], resp. R, m = 1, 2, . . . dim(S × R), and |S × R; m is the corresponding basisvector in a S × R representation present in the fermionic Fock-space H(d) = H 2 1 2 S D ×H 2 1 2 S D (cf. [1]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>). As pointed out by M. Bordemann, one way to construct a state that will be annihilated by all the supercharges, is to let</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Ψ =   s d β=1 Q β   Φ (3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>with Φ being any of the harmonic states (2). The crucial question is: for which Φ will (3) be non-zero? Let d = 9 now (s d = 16). The guess which I would like to discuss here, is that</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ = r −16 |1 (4) will do, where |1 is the unique Weyl × Spin(9) invariant state in H = H 256 ⊗ H 256 . Why (4</trash>

					<figDesc>)? One simple reason(ing) is the following: As each Q β , acting on the product of a harmonic, homogenous polynomial and a negative power of r will increase the degree of the polynomial, (4) is the only harmonic state which certainly (a priori!) can not be the image of Q β acting on some harmonic χ.</figDesc>
					<trash>Actually, if we could show that all harmonic Φ&apos;s not containing a contribution from l = 0 are of the form Φ = ρ Q β Φ β (5) with Φ β harmonic, (4) would necessarily be the only chance left, as (3) is clearly identically zero, if Φ is of the form (5). In any case, consider now Ψ := ǫ β1···β16 Q β1 · Q β2 · · · Q β16 1 r 16 |1 (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Is it zero? First of all, one needs to know more explicitly, what the state |1 ∈ H is.</figDesc>
					<trash>As H 256 contains only 3 irreducible Spin(9) representations, H 256 = 44 ⊕ 84 ⊕ 128 H contains only 3 Spin(9) singlets, namely |1 44 := s,t |st|st ′ |1 84 := s,t,u |stu|stu ′ (7) |1 128 := t,α |tα|tα ′ .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>For notational simplicity, the fermions Θ αk=2 are sometimes denoted by Θ ′ α , and |st = |ts ( s |ss = 0), |stu (totally antisymmetric in s, t, u) and |tα(with γ t βα |tα = 0) stands for the basis-elements of the 44,84, resp. 128-dimensional representation.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Defining fermionic creation operators λ αk := 1 √ 2 (Θ αk + iΘ α+8,k ) α=1,...,8 (8) together with the representation γ 9 = 1 0 0 −1 , γ 8 = 0 1 1 0 , γ j = 0 iΓ j −iΓ j 0 , (iΓ j ) k8 := δ jk , (iΓ j ) kl := −c jkl , and totally antisymmetric &apos;octonionic structure constants&apos; c jkl = +1 for (ijk) = 123, 147, 165, 246, 257, 354, 367</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>, the 3 states in (7) may also be explicitely given as concrete polynomials in the creation operators λ αk . E.g., with b j := i 4 λ α Γ</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>i αβ λ β , c j := i 4 λ ′ α Γ i αβ λ ′ β (9) one finds |1 44 = (b · c) 2 − 1 9 b 2 c 2 − 2 9 b · c(b 2 + c 2 ) + 2 63 (b 4 + c 4 ) |0 (10) while the states |st are explicitly given as follows (|8 := λ 1 · · · λ 8 |0) |i = j = b i b j |0 |jj = (b 2 j − 1 9 b 2 )|0 |j9 = − i 2 (b j + 2 9 b j b 2 )|0 |j8 = 1 2 (b j − 2 9 b j b 2 )|0 |89 = − i 2 (|0 − |8) (11) |88 = − 1 2 (−|0 + 2 9 b 2 |0 − |8) (12) |99 = − 1 2 (|0 + 2 9 b 2 |0 + |8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In any case, as one of the Weyl-transformations changes λ ′ α to -λ ′ α (while leaving λ α invariant), |1 128 can not be contained in the Weyl-invariant state |1, which therefore must be a linear combination of |1 44 and |1 84 Projecting (6) onto this linear combination will give some Weyl × Spin(9) invariant differential operator of degree 16 (with constant coefficients), acting on r −16 . While R. Suter and I checked, by using quite different methods, that a priori only 2 such independent operators, not containing the full Laplaceoperator (which annihilates r −16 !) exist, one needs to know 1|Θ α1k1 Θ α2k2 · · · Θ α16k16 |1 (13) resp. the contraction with ǫ β1···β16 γ t1 β1α1 · · · γ t16 β16α16 (times ∇ t1k1 · · · ∇ t16k16 r −16 ). Should the result turn out to be non-zero, (6) will, by construction, be a non-trivial supersymmetric wave function. For general N &gt; 2 the corresponding asymptotic fall off would be r −((N −1)d+14) . A simpler way to describe the fermionic part of the wavefunction is to define fermionic creation operators</p>
