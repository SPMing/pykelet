				<p>We construct and explore BPS states that preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry in N = 4 Yang-Mills theories. Such states are also realized as three-pronged strings ending on D3-branes. We correct the electric part of the BPS equation and relate its solutions to the unbroken abelian gauge group generators. Generic 1/4-BPS solitons are not spherically symmetric, but consist of two or more dyonic components held apart by a delicate balance between static electromagnetic force and scalar Higgs force. The instability previously found in three-pronged string configurations is due to excessive repulsion by one of these static forces. We also present an alternate construction of these 1/4-BPS states from quantum excitations around a magnetic monopole, and build up the supermultiplet for arbitrary (quantized) electric charge. The degeneracy and the highest spin of the supermultiplet increase linearly with a relative electric charge. We conclude with comments.</p>

				<p>from the usual BPS states that break only half of supersymmetry. For instance, suppose that we have SU (n) broken down to U (1) n−1 . Pick a pair of roots α and β with α 2 = β 2 = 1 and α · β = −1/2. A state of magnetic charge mα + mβ and of electric charge nα would then be 1/4-BPS.</p>

				<p>Now the question is how these 1/4-BPS states are realized on the field theory side. One might be tempted to look for a spherically symmetric soliton. In fact, very recently, a special class of 1/4-BPS states in SU (3) theory was found in a spherically symmetric ansatz [6]. In terms of roots, these BPS configurations carry magnetic charge of 2α + 2β. However, as will become clear in later sections, the existence of these solutions is quite accidental and fails to illuminate how the general 1/4-BPS dyons are constructed in the field theory language. One severe problem is that if their electric charge is, say, of the form qα, the real number 4 q is determined uniquely by the Higgs vev&apos;s. (In the spherically symmetric case of the total magnetic charge, α + β, for instance, q has to vanish for all vev&apos;s.) Because of this, at generic point of vacuum moduli space, BPS configurations of properly quantized electric charge (q = integer) cannot be realized as a spherically symmetric classical soliton.</p>

				<p>In general, we expect the BPS configurations to be of an elongated shape.</p>

				<p>Roughly speaking, it will consist of a pair of dyonic cores which are bound but separated by some distance R. This is due to a delicate balance between static electromagnetic force and scalar Higgs force. (See section 3.) Once we realize this, it is almost obvious that the amount of electric charge has to depend on the separation R as well as Higgs vev&apos;s. What one misses by insisting the spherical symmetry is this extra parameter R. With this picture in mind, it is now clear that a BPS configuration of given electric and magnetic charges will have some definite length R that parameterizes the deviation from the spherical symmetry.</p>

				<p>This begs for another question: what happens in the limit of R → ∞? Since it is electromagnetic and Higgs interaction that separates the two dyonic cores, a change in R implies a change in electric charge. At R → ∞, the electric charge of the 1/4-BPS state reaches a limiting value. In all cases we consider, the charge will actually reach its maximum possible value. Trying to put an even larger electric charge will result in an instability and cause the two cores to fly away from each other. The upper bound on the electric charge can be also translated into a lower bound on a linear combination of Higgs vev&apos;s with any given electric charge, in which form the instability was found half of supersymmetry. 4 Recall in the three pronged string configuration in Ref. [ 1 ] .</p>

				<p>The paper is organized as follows . In section 2 , we derive the BPS bound of the energy functional and write down the complete set of equations that 1 / 4 - BPS dyons must satisfy . This corrects and generalizes those in Ref . [ 7 ] . The magnetic part of the equations are unaffected by the electric part . Given any purely magnetic BPS solutions , the electric part is determined by solving a single four - dimensional covariant Laplace equation of an adjoint scalar . The existence of its solutions is tied to the existence of U ( 1 ) gauge zero - modes of the purely magnetic soliton , which completes the existence proof of all the expected 1 / 4 - BPS dyonic states corresponding to three - pronged strings . In section 3 , we take the specific example of SU ( 3 ) broken to U ( 1 ) 2 . The 1 / 4 - BPS dyonic configuration of magnetic charge α+β is constructed , from which we extract the relationship between Higgs vev &apos; s , electric charges , and the separation length R . Important but technical details involve ADHMN construction , which we put in the appendices . We digress in section 4 , and compare the field theory results to those from D - brane / three - pronged string picture . The instability bound is compared with that from the string construction , and a perfect fit is found .</p>

				<p>In section 5 , we present an alternate construction of the 1 / 4 - BPS dyons via exciting compactly supported eigenmodes around spherically symmetric monopoles of magnetic charge α + β . The correct supermultiplet structure of 1 / 4 - BPS states are shown to be reproduced , after a careful consideration of low energy eigenmodes . The approximation , however , ignores some backreaction of the bosonic background to excitation of these eigenmodes , which puts a stringent criteria on the validity of the construction . Because of this , in particular , it is impossible to see the instability in this second picture . In section 6 , we use this construction to build up the supermultiplet structure of dyons of arbitrary quantized electric charge . Finally in section 7 , we conclude with comments on unresolved issues .</p>

				<head n="2">BPS Energy Bound and Equations</head>

				<p>Since the electric part of the BPS equations we found is different from what is commonly known [ 7 ] , we will rederive the BPS energy bound and equations from scratch . Also there are several interesting new comments to be made about the BPS field configurations . We start by considering the bosonic Lagrangian of the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang - Mills theories . With the gauge group SU ( n ) with hermitian generators T a in the n dimensional representation with the normalization tr T a T b = δ ab / 2 , we introduce the gauge field A µ =</p>

The bosonic Lagrangian density is L = tr − 1 2 F µν F µν + D µ φ I D µ φ I − 1 2 6 I , J=1 ( −ie [ φ I , φ J ] ) 2 , ( 2 . 1 ) where D µ φ I = ∂ µ φ I − ie [ A µ , φ I ] . 2 . 1 BPS bound The energy density is H = tr ( E i ) 2 + ( B i ) 2 + ( D 0 φ I ) 2 + ( D i φ I ) 2 + I&lt;J ( −ie [ φ I , φ J ] ) 2 = tr ( a I E i + b I B i − D i φ I ) 2 + ( D 0 φ I ) 2 + I&lt;J ( −ie [ φ I , φ J ] ) 2 + 2 tr E i D i a · φ + B i D i b · φ , ( 2 . 2 ) where a I , b</trash>

				<p>I are two arbitrary six - dimensional unit vectors orthogonal to each other , a · φ ≡ a I φ I and b · φ ≡ b I φ I . The cross terms can be rewritten as , tr B i D i b · φ = ∂ i ( tr b · φB i )</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Denote collectively by ζ I , the components of φ I which are orthogonal to both a I and b I . We split the energy density from the scalar fields into two parts ;</p>

				<p>Every term except those in the last line is nonnegative , so the total energy is bounded by the contribution from the latter ;</p>

				</figure>

				<p>One most stringent bound must be found by varying a I and b I and achieving the maximum . The quantities Q E I and Q M I can be evaluated by converting to boundary integrals , and clearly depends on the asymptotics only .</p>

				<p>The expression a I Q E I + b I Q M I is maximized only if the two unit vectors lie on the plane spanned by Q M I and Q E I . Assuming this , let α be the angle between Q M I and Q E I , and θ the one between b I and Q M I . The extrema occur if and only if</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>± a I Q M I = b I Q E I , ( 2 . 12 ) which can be translated to an equivalent condition ; tan θ = ±Q E cos α Q M ± Q E sin α . ( 2 . 13 )</trash>

				</figure>

				<p>The BPS bound is saturated when every bulk term in the energy density vanishes , from which we obtain total eight sets of equations . The first part is the most familiar ; B i = D i b · φ . ( 2 . 16 ) This is the usual BPS equation that admits magnetic monopole solutions . Note that this magnetic equation can be solved independently , regardless of remaining equations . The other BPS equations influence only the choice of the unit vector b I . This fact is of crucial important when we construct the BPS solution later .</p>

				<p>The second , electric part is made of several equations</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>E i = D i a · φ , ( 2 . 17 ) D 0 a · φ = 0 , ( 2 . 18 ) D 0 b · φ = −ie [ b · φ , a · φ ] . ( 2 . 19 ) Using the latter two , we reduce the Gauss law ( 2 . 5 ) to D i E i = e 2 [ b · φ , [ b · φ , a · φ ] ] + e 2 [ ζ I , [ ζ I , a · φ ] ] . ( 2 . 20 ) Combining this with Eq . ( 2 . 17 ) into a single second order linear differential equation , we find that D i D i a · φ = e 2 [ b · φ , [ b · φ , a · φ ] ] + e 2 [ ζ I , [ ζ I , a · φ ] ] . ( 2 . 21 )</trash>

				<p>which is a linear equation for a · φ once ζ I &apos; s are given .</p>

				<p>So far we have not required that the spatial gauge field A i be time - independent . If we choose such a gauge , one sees easily that Eq</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>. ( 2 . 17 ) is solved by A 0 = −a · φ . ( 2 . 22 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In this gauge , D 0 ζ I − ie [ a · φ , ζ I ] = ∂ 0 ζ I = 0 , which requires ζ I be time - independent . Other ζ I equations require them to be covariantly constant ( D i ζ I = 0 ) , commute with b·φ , and also commute among themselves : In the unitary gauge where b·φ is diagonal , the ζ &apos; s are all diagonal , constant , and uniform , and also commute with the A i &apos; s . The latter condition implies that each ζ I is proportional to the identity in each irreducible block ( s ) spanned by nontrivial part of the configurations A i and b · φ . 5 Imagine that one think of the magnetic solution to Eq . ( 2 . 16 ) as embedded along a subgroup of the original gauge group ; the expectation value ζ I &apos; s must be invariant under such a subgroup .</p>

				<p>Now Eq . ( 2 . 21 ) is a zero - eigenvalue problem of a nonnegative operator acting on a · φ linearly .</p>

				<p>Under the boundary condition that a · φ ( ∞ ) should commute with the asymptotics of b · φ and ζ I , its solutions have nontrival behavior only in the said irreducible block ( s ) . Thus ζ I should also commute with a · φ . With such expectation value ζ I &apos; s , Eq</p>

				<p>This is a four - dimensional covariant Laplacian for an adjoint scalar field , provided that we identify D 4 ≡ −ieb · φ . A more restricted version of this equation , where one assumes [ b · φ , a · φ ] = 0 as well , has appeared and been used in existing literatures [ 7 , 6 ] . Thus , we find two sets of relevant BPS equations , given by Eq . ( 2 . 16 ) and ( 2 . 23 ) , that must be solved to produce classical 1 / 4 - BPS configurations . ( See Appendix E for a discussion about the energy density of BPS configurations . )</p>

				<p>The n − 1 dimensional vectors g and q are the magnetic and the electric charge , respectively , while H generates the Cartan subalgbra of SU ( n ) .</p>

				<p>We need to solve the first order equation ( 2 . 16 ) and the second order equation ( 2 . 23 ) . The first order equation is the well - understood BPS equation for monopoles [ 8 ] . Let the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs be such that</p>

				<figure>

				</figure>

				<p>with nonnegative integers l r . One interprets such configurations as being made of n − 1 species of fundamental monopoles , where l r is the number of the r - th fundamental monopole associated with the simple root β r . The conditions on the diagonal ζ I &apos; s can be translated quite easily now .</p>

				<p>Generically , ζ I must have vanishing inner products with all β r whenever l r = 0 . Only exception is when a consecutative chain of β r is such that l s = · · · = l s+t and the corresponding monopoles are &quot; coincident . &quot; In that case , ζ I must have a vanishing inner product with r=s+t r=s β r but not necessarily with individual β r , . . . , β r+s .</p>

				<p>The second - order BPS equation ( 2 . 23 ) is to be solved in the background of purely magnetic solutions to B i = D i ( b · φ ) . While we will come back to actual solutions for specific examples next section , it is important to note that the existence of the solution is already well established . In fact , we know the exact number of linearly independent solutions . This is because any gauge zero mode of a BPS monopole solution is automatically a solution to Eq . ( 2 . 23 ) .</p>

				<p>Recall that the conventional way of finding zero - modes of BPS monopoles is to perturb B i = D i Φ and impose the background gauge D i δA i = ie [ Φ , δΦ ] [ 8 ] . For a gauge zero - mode , say , generated by a gauge function Λ , the linearized BPS equations are always satisfied since both B i and D i Φ are gauge - covariant . Only the gauge - fixing condition is nontrivial , D i δA i = ie [ Φ , δΦ ] ⇒ D i D i Λ = e 2 [ Φ , [ Φ , Λ ] ] . ( 2 . 28 ) Inserting the solution to B i = D i ( b · φ ) as the background field , and replacing Λ by a · φ , we realize that this is identical to Eq . ( 2 . 23 ) . The number of solutions to this covariant Laplace equation , must equal the number of unbroken U ( 1 ) generators that act nontrivially on the monopole solution .</p>

				<p>There must be at least one and at most n − 1 .</p>

				<p>Where is the electric charge located ? When magnetic monopoles described by the first BPS equation ( 2 . 16 ) are well separated from each other , the field configuration outside the core region would be purely abelian and so cannot carry any electric charge . Each fundamental monopole may carry only its own type of electric charge , that is , β r monopoles can carry only β r electric charge for any simple roots β r . One could say that generic 1 / 4 - BPS configurations are made of classically bound ( two or more ) 1 / 2 - BPS dyons .</p>

				<p>One might think that there is something odd about what we are doing here . After all , what we mean by b · φ and a · φ do depend on what kind of electric and magnetic charges we have , yet we seem to have fixed b I even before turning on the electric charge . But what matters at the end of the day is that we get a set of field configurations that solve all BPS equations simultaneously for some b I and a I . The BPS bound is a mini - max problem where one tries to obtain a most stringent lower bound for all reasonably smooth configurations . The simple fact that a configuration saturates a lower bound , implies that the bound it saturates is actually the maximum possible of all lower bounds . In section 3 , we shall see how this is realized in a concrete way . 3 1 / 4 - BPS Soliton in the SU ( 3 ) Theory As an example , let us consider the SU ( 3 ) gauge group . Following the strategy outlined in the previous section , we start with a purely magnetic BPS configuration of a pair of distinct monopoles .</p>

				<p>The configuration must solve only the magnetic part of BPS equations , and the scalar BPS equation will be solved in that background .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>If we let b · φ ( ∞ ) be equal to diag ( h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ) with h 1 &lt; h 2 &lt; h 3 and h 1 + h 2 + h 3 = 0 , the two fundamental monopoles would have magnetic charges , 7 4π α · H = 2π diag ( −1 , +1 , 0 ) , ( 3 . 1 ) 4π β · H = 2π diag ( 0 , −1 , +1 ) . ( 3 . 2 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We will label these monopoles by their charge vector in root space ; α and β . Throughout the rest of the paper , we will consider 1 / 4 - BPS configurations with magnetic charge of α + β . Accordingly , the asymptotic behavior of b · φ would be</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>b · φ ≃ diag ( h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ) − ( α + β ) · H r . ( 3 . 3 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>From the work of E . Weinberg [ 8 ] , we learn that the separation between the two monopole cores is an arbitrary parameter , which we denote by R . R uniquely determines A i and b · φ up to overall position , spatial orientation , and internal gauge angles . The explicit form of the field configuration can be obtained in principle from the ADHMN formalism [ 9 , 10 ] . The latter is summarized in Appendices A and B . Recently , E . Weinberg and one of the authors ( P . Y . ) have found the explicit A i and b · φ configuration for these two monopoles by exploring the Nahm &apos; s formalism [ 11 ] .</p>

				<p>Now the difficult part is to solve the covariant Laplace equation ;</p>

					<trash>D 2 i Λ = [ b · φ , [ b · φ , Λ ] ] . ( 3 . 4 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Once this is done , we simply take a · φ to be a linear combination of all possible solutions Λ . We know , from the arguments of previous section , there exist two linearly independent solutions . We already know one such solution , since D 2 i ( b · φ ) = D i B i = 0 and b · φ obviously commutes with itself . How do we find the other solution ? There have been several works on the finding the solution of the covariant Laplacian of the adjoint Higgs field around the instanton background [ 12 ] .</p>

				<p>roots and one of which does to one minimal negative root . This additional monopole solution depends on the x 4 coordinate of S 1 and here we take the limit where this additional monopole is taken to spatial infinity .</p>

				<p>We will refer all detailed computation of the SU ( 3 ) case to the Appendix D . In this section , we will simply borrow the result and use it for the study of ( unquantized ) 1 / 4 - BPS configurations .</p>

				<p>Combine the Higgs expectation values to µ 2 = h 3 − h 2 and µ 1 = h 2 − h 1 . For SU ( 3 ) case , there are two independent solutions to the covariant Laplace equations , since there are two unbroken U ( 1 ) &apos; s acting on the pair of monopole solutions . We will only need their asymptotic forms , which can be read off from Eq . ( D8 ) .</p>

				<p>As mentioned above , the first is proportional to the Higgs field b · φ itself , whose asymptotics</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>are Λ T ≃ diag h 1 + 1 2r , h 2 , h 3 − 1 2r , ( 3 . 5 ) while the second is a bit more involved Λ R ≃ diag µ 2 + p 1 2r , − ( µ 1 + µ 2 ) + p 2 − p 1 2r , µ 1 − p 2 2r . ( 3 . 6 ) The real numbers p 1 and p 2 are defined to be p 1 = µ 1 − µ 2 − 2 ( µ 1 + 2µ 2 ) µ 2 R µ 1 + µ 2 + 2µ 1 µ 2 R , p 2 = µ 1 − µ 2 + 2 ( 2µ 1 + µ 2 ) µ 1 R µ 1 + µ 2 + 2µ 1 µ 2 R . ( 3 . 7 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>R is again the separation between the two monopoles , as naturally occurs in the standard form of monopole moduli space metric or in the Nahm data .</p>

				<p>The scalar field a · φ and thus A 0 would be in general a linear combination of Λ T and Λ R .</p>

				<p>Denote the respective coefficients by ξ and η ;</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>a · φ ( ∞ ) = ξ diag ( h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ) + η diag ( µ 2 , −µ 2 − µ 1 , µ 1 ) = ξh · H + 2η ( µ 1 β · H − µ 2 α · H ) . ( 3 . 8 ) The resulting electric charge is such that q = q α α + q β β , ( 3 . 9 ) where q α = 4π ( ξ + ηp 1 ) , q β = 4π ( ξ + ηp 2 ) . ( 3 . 10 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>For any nonzero separation R , the electric charge is misaligned against the magnetic charge unless η = 0 . For R = 0 , however , electric charge is proportional to α + β . For any R , it is easy to double - check that the BPS configuration indeed saturate the most stringent BPS bound . All one need to ensure is that the angle θ between Q M I and b I is unchanged as the electric charge is turned on , which is in turn guaranteed as Eq . ( 2 . 12 ) holds . This is always true for the solution we obtained .</p>

				<p>The resulting 1 / 4 - BPS configuration is then composed of a pair of distinct monopole separated by a distance R , and on top of which the time - like gauge potential A 0 = −a · φ is turned on to carry the additional electric charge whose relative value is completely determined by R . The α monopole would carry q α electric charge and the β monopole would carry q β electric charge . The relative electric charge ( q β − q α ) / 2 is the part of the electric charge orthogonal to the magnetic charge and is given by</p>

				</figure>

				<p>This is responsible for the electromagnetic repulsion , which must be balanced against the Higgs attraction . 8 Note that ∆q is a monotonic function of R . In particular , R = 0 implies that ∆q = 0 as well . When the two constituent monopoles form a single spherically symmetric configuration , they can be 1 / 2 - BPS but not 1 / 4 - BPS .</p>

				<p>As ∆q increases , R increases , and at some critical charge , the separation diverges , R → ∞ .</p>

				<p>This of course signals that the BPS configuration no longer exists as a single particle state . Two solitonic cores are separated by arbitrarily large distance once ∆q reaches its maximum possible</p>

While we carried out the analysis with arbitrary electric charges , it is simply a matter of putting particular values of R if one wishes to extend the result to properly quantized dyons . Before closing this section , we would like to clarify how a spherically symmetric 1 / 4 - BPS dyon is possible for higher magnetic charges . As we just saw , the only spherically symmetric solution with 8 It would be interesting to derive this relative charge from the consideration of the long range force law .</trash>

				<p>They cannot possess any relative electric charge . However , when the magnetic charge is a double , say 2α + 2β , the analog of this 1 / 2 - BPS , purely magnetic state is not spherically symmetric .</p>

				<p>The situation is analogous to having a pair of identical SU ( 2 ) monopoles as close to each other as possible , if we consider the SU ( 2 ) as embedded inside SU ( 3 ) along α + β . We know from early works on SU ( 2 ) monopoles that this configuration is cylindrically symmetric , and of toroidal shape [ 16 ] . As we turn on relative electric charge and thereby reduce the state to 1 / 4 - BPS , all four constituents , two α &apos; s and two β &apos; s , begin to move away from one another , and eventually become independent . It is then conceivably that , at some specific electric charge , the all four soliton cores are separated just right so that they actually form a spherically symmetric shape . The one solution found in Ref . [ 6 ] , is an example of this phenomenon .</p>

				<p>Let us compare the above result against the string picture . For the purpose of this section , we will pretend that string tension is not quantized , since in the end the physics of instability can be understood classically .

				<p>In principle , the supermultiplet structure of the 1 / 4 - BPS states should be recovered from low energy quantum mechanics of the above solitonic solution . However , in this paper , we will take a shortcut , and ask the question of degeneracy by presenting an alternate construction of these dyonic states .</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>For simplicity , we will confine the present discussion to the case of SU ( 3 ) . We start with the spherically symmetric magnetic monopole solution obtained by an SU ( 2 ) embedding along the root α + β with the single nonuniform Higgs b · φ . If a · φ vanished , the monopole would have 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic zero modes . In a generic vacuum where a · φ = 0 , however , half of these 16 zero modes are lifted and acquire finite energy . Of the remaining 4 bosonic zero modes , three corresponds to translations and one is generated by global U ( 1 ) transformations .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>There are also 4 fermionic zero modes , quantization of which imparts a N = 4 vector multiplet structure , thus the degeneracy 2 4 , to the soliton .</p>

				<p>A minimal 1 / 4 - BPS states should have a degeneracy factor of 2 6 and highest spin 3 / 2 . To see how such structures arise , we need to pay close attention to those modes lifted by a · φ = 0 .</p>

				<p>Fermionic modes are easiest to follow . Introduce a basis for Dirac matrices where γ 0 is diagonal and γ 5 is off - diagonal ,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>written in the time - independent form with the energy eigenvalue ǫ . Here we used a static gauge with the purely magnetic background solution . N = 4 theory has two ( adjoint ) Dirac fermions , which together lift to a Dirac spinor in 6 - dimensions . The two are of opposite six - dimensional chiralities , and the subscript ± refers to this fact .</p>

				<p>Decomposing the Dirac spinors as Ψ = ( χ , ψ ) T in term of two - component spinors , and defining an operator D ≡ iσ k D k + i b · φ , the Dirac equations is rewritten as ,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Recall that , given a BPS background monopole configuration that satisfies B k = D k ( b · φ ) , the operator D has zero modes while D † does not . When a · φ = 0 , each Dirac fermion contributes 4 zero modes ( E = 0 ) ; they solve Dψ = 0 and χ = 0 . The 4 solutions to Dψ = 0 can be labeled by the representation under the embedded SU ( 2 ) . The adjoint representation of the gauge group SU ( 3 ) is decomposed into a triplet , a pair of doublet , and a singlet with respect to the SU ( 2 ) embedded along α + β . The singlet is associated with the generator α · H − β · H , while the two doublets are associated with the pairs ( E α , E −β ) and ( E β , E −α ) . The triplet would contribute two zero modes , and each doublet would contribute one , which account for all four solutions to Dψ = 0 .</p>

				<p>By construction of Eq . ( 5 . 4 ) , the uniform field a · φ is orthogonal to the total magnetic charge α + β ; a · φ = v ( α · H − β · H ) , ( 5 . 7 ) which has a nontrivial commutator only with isospin doublets , and even then acts on each as an multiplication by a number . With a · φ = 0 , therefore , those modes from the isospin triplets commutes with b · φ and survives as zero modes . As mentioned above , quantization of these leads to a vector multiplet structure of degeneracy 2 4 = 16 .</p>

				<p>The other four from isospinor doublets can no longer be zero modes , however , and are promoted to finite energy eigenmodes of the form [ 17 ] ,</p>

				<p><formula>Ψ ± = e −iǫt 0 ψ . ( 5 . 8 )</formula></p>

				<p>The isospin doublet , 2 - component spinor ψ is exactly of the same mode that solves Dψ = 0 , and thus are normalizable . They are compactly supported around the monopole core . The energy eigenvalue ǫ equals ±3v / 2 for the first doublet and ∓3v / 2 for the second doublet . This is because [ a · φ , E α ] = 3v 2 E α , [ a · φ , E −β ] = 3v 2 E −β , ( 5 . 9 ) and similarly for E β and E −α with a negative sign . Filling the Dirac sea up to ǫ = 0 , creation ( or annihilation ) of one of these eigenmodes will result in a quantum excitation that costs a positive energy |ǫ| = |3v / 2| .</p>

				<p>To check against the BPS mass formula , we need the behavior of electric field at large distances when one of these modes is turned on . From various considerations , it is well known that these modes from gauge doublets carry no angular momentum . This can be surmised from the angular momentum formula , J = L + s + t , where the SU ( 2 ) gauge generators t are added to orbital and spin angular momenta . The solution to Dψ = 0 with an SU ( 2 ) doublet ψ is unique and spherically symmetric ( L 2 = 0 ) , hence must be of the form ,</p>

					<figDesc>from the second . The isospin and the spin are correlated in such a way that J 2 = ( s + t ) 2 = 0 .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>From this , we learn that the mode by itself carries an electric charge of ± ( α − β ) / 2 , or the relative charge is ∆q = ∓1 / 2 .</p>

				<p>However , there is a well known subtlety associated with turning on such a mode from a gauge doublet . Because it acquires a phase of −1 upon a gauge rotation corresponding to the center of SU ( 2 ) , its excitation must be accompanied by a half - integer momentum along internal phase angle of the background monopole . This leads to additional electric charges of the form ( m / 2 ) ( α + β ) for any odd integer m . The minimal states are those with m = ±1 . Combining this with the fermionic contribution , we find the electric charges are ±α or ∓β . With two Dirac spinors Ψ ± then , quantization leads to eight minimal dyonic excitations , which split into four pairs of identical electric charges , α , −β , β , −α . Excitation energy due to the half - integer momentum m / 2 = ±1 / 2 is of second order in electric charge , and will not affect the leading approximation .</p>

				<p>Does the leading excitation energy |ǫ| = |3v / 2| agree with the general BPS mass formula ? In the limit of small electric coupling , 9 the central charges may be expanded as</p>

				<p>which coincides with |ǫ| = |3v / 2| , as it should if the dyonic state is indeed 1 / 4 - BPS . The bosonic counterpart of this eigenmode analysis should proceed similarly , except that the corresponding eigenmodes will come in a pair of spin doublets rather than four spin singlets . The final result is , then , for each electric charge , α , −β , β , −α , there are 2 + 2 = 4 dyonic excitations due to the gauge - doublet eigenmodes : the net degeneracy of the resulting dyon is 4 × 2 4 = 2 6 for each electric charge , where we take into account the extra degeneracy of 2 4 due to the four fermionic zero modes from SU ( 2 ) triplets . The spin content of each dyon multiplet is that of two N = 4 vector multiplets ( from fermionic eigenmodes ) plus a tensor product of a spin doublet and one N = 4 vector multiplet ( from bosonic eigenmodes ) . This is precisely the 1 / 4 - BPS multiplet of highest spin 3 / 2 . The four types of 1 / 4 - BPS dyons correspond to the four different string configurations depicted in Fig . 2</p>

				<p>which is obtained by expanding the BPS bound . It is clear from the subleading contributions to dyon energies that these criteria are necessary for a successful match between the BPS mass and the energy found from eigenmode analysis .

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The present approximation takes into account only part of the backreactions . It does address the change in long - range electric field in response to the excitation , but ignored its counterpart in magnetic soliton structure .

The consequence is that our choice of b I is independent of the electric charge being turned on , such that b I is in fact parallel to Q M I . To obtain the correct BPS bound , in reality , the angle θ between b I and Q M I must be given by tan θ = ±Q E cos α Q M ± Q E sin α ≃ ± Q E cos α Q M , ( 5 . 15 ) where we used the first condition Q M ≫ Q E sin α .

					<figDesc>where δθ ′ ≡ θ − θ ′ = θ , due to the incorrect angle θ ′ = 0 . Since we ignore the magnetic backreaction to the quantum excitation , we must require this error be negligible against the first order estimate , which explains the second condition . It also explains why we do not find the phenomenon of instability in the present set - up . Bergman &apos; s criteria tells us that it occurs when ( Q E cos α ) 2 is comparable to Q M Q E sin α , where magnetic backreaction to the quantum excitations are of a first order effect , instead of being a second order effect . Instability cannot be probed without taking into account the reaction of magnetic soliton to the quantum excitation . In this sense , the two constructions we gave are complimentary to each other ; the first gave us the understanding of the dynamics while the second is better suited for state counting .</figDesc>

				<p>In the previous section , we saw how the supermultiplet of degeneracy 2 6 arises in case of minimally charged BPS states .

				<p>with integers k and m . Consistent quantization requires that m is odd ( even ) whenever k is odd ( even ) . The relative charge of the system is given by ∆q = ( q β − q α ) / 2 = k / 2 . The integer k corresponds to the number of excited eigenmodes while m / 2 is the momentum along a internal U ( 1 ) angle of the magnetic solitons . The case of no relative electric charge ∆q = 0 corresponds to the usual BPS dyon that breaks half of supersymmetry , which come in an N = 4 vector multiplet .</p>

				<p>The case of ∆q = ±1 / 2 was addressed in the previous section . The supermultiplet structure found there can be summarized in terms of the eigenvalues under one of the angular momentum operators ,</p>

				<p>The total degeneracy is 2 6 , which , for 1 / 4 - BPS state , is the smallest while being also consistent with supersymmetry . Call this multiplet G 0 . This multiplet can be seen as a tensor product between N = 4 vector multiplet with a N = 1 chiral multiplet .</p>

				<p>Higher charged states with |∆q| ≥ 1 is obtained by exciting appropriate eigenmodes k = 2|∆q| times . Given a fixed electric charge , there are always two bosonic and two fermionic eigenmodes at disposal . There are k + 1 states where no fermionic modes are excited , 2k states where one fermionic modes are excited , and k − 1 states where both fermionic modes are excited . Combining the degeneracy from four fermion zero modes of the center of mass motion , we then find the total degeneracy of 4k × 2 4 = 4 ( 2|∆q| ) × 2 4 = ( 2|∆q| ) × 2 6 . For detailed spin content , we only need to recall that 2 4 has the vector structure and that bosonic excitations carry extra spin of ±1 / 2 . The result is the sum of 2|∆q| tables identical to the above , except that J 3 eigenvalues are shifted ,</p>

The highest spin of such a multiplet is |∆q| + 1 . From construction , it is easy to see that |∆q| of this arises from bosonic excitations . The only fermionic contribution comes from the four fermionic zero modes , which tops out at 1 .</p>

				<p>This bosonic spin has a rather interesting explanation in the context of classical dyonic configu - rations of section 3 . Consider the limit of large Higgs vev &apos; s .

				<head n="7">Conclusion</head>

				<p>In this paper we explored 1 / 4 - BPS states in N = 4 supersymmetric theories which correspond to three - pronged strings ending on D3 - branes in Type IIB string theory . 1 / 4 - BPS configurations typically consist of two ( or more ) dyonic cores , which are positioned so that static electromagnetic force is perfectly balanced against scalar Higgs force . The marginal instability previously found in</p>

				<p>string picture is shown to arise from the excessive repulsion from either electromagnetic or Higgs interaction . An alternate construction using the finite energy excitations around purely magnetic soliton also revealed supermultiplet structure of 1 / 4 - BPS states with arbitrary relative electric charge . The degneracy and the highest spin the supermultiplets grow linearly with the relative charge . In the minimal cases , the multiplet has the degeneracy of 2 6 with the highest spin 3 / 2 .</p>

				<p>In principle , the question of degeneracy and supermultiplet structures can also be addressed by considering low energy quantum mechanics of the classical 1 / 4 - BPS solution we found . This would necessarily involve zero - mode analysis of these nonspherical solitons , which we did not attempt .</p>

				<p>Our constructions can be generalized to the case of multi - pronged string configurations in larger gauge groups . In the small coupling limit , the same eigenmode analysis should produce the dyonic states of higher magnetic and electric charges . Also classically , one can distribute many monopole in the background , and solve for possible electric configurations . We expect to find multi - dyon configurations hung together by the delicate balance of static forces . We should be able to exploit the ADHMN formalism as in this work to explore these field configurations . One interesting case is when the gauge symmetry is partially restored as in Ref . [ 19 ] . For solutions whose net magnetic charge is abelian , the configuration typically consists of massive magnetic cores surrounded by nonabelian magnetic clouds . It would be interesting to see if any new physics arises by considering 1 / 4 - BPS version of such nonabelian configurations .</p>

				<p>While we considered only N = 4 theories so far , it is clear that the methods developed here can be applied to N = 2 theories with minimal modifications . N = 2 supersymmetry algebra possesses half the supersymmetry generators and also only one central charge , so we naturally expect the spectrum be qualitatively different . This is quite apparent from the point of view adopted in section 5 , since reducing supersymmetry involves removing one of the two adjoint Dirac spinors . In fact , there appears to be no guarantee that the present constructions produce proper 1 / 2 - BPS states .</p>

				<p>It may in general depend on the particular electromagnetic charges , Higgs vev &apos; s , and other details of the theory . We are currently exploring some of the issues .</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The general method to find the solution of the covariant Laplacian for a scalar field in the adjoint representation has been developed in the instanton background [ 12 ] . We start with a general form Φ ( x ) = v † Qv , ( C1 ) where Q is an hermitian ( n + 2k ) × ( n + 2k ) matrix . We assume that Q is independent of x and takes the ansatz</p>

				<figure>

				</figure>

				<p>where tr 2 is a trace over 2 - dimensional part of matrices . With two hermitian k × k matrices , W = tr 2 λ † λ , Λ = tr 2 λ † qλ , ( C4 ) the condition for the scalar field to satisfy the covariant Laplace equation D 2 α Φ = 0 becomes a condition on the matrix p , − [ µ α , [ µ α , p ] ] − 1 2 {W , p} + Λ = 0 . ( C5 )</p>

				<p>Note that the above equation determines p for a given infinitesimal generator q of SU ( n ) . Especially when q = I n×n , we can see p = I k×k solves the above equation .</p>

				<p>For similar scalar fields in any caloron background , we extend the method described in Appendix B . We generalize Eq . ( C2 ) to an infinite dimensional matrix , and then the analogy of</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Eq . ( C1 ) would be Φ = N − 1 2 qN − 1 2 + N − 1 2 u † l p ll ′ u l ′ N − 1 2 . ( C6 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Similar to the gauge field , the adjoint Higgs scalar field should satisfy the quasi - periodic condition Φ ( x , x 4 + β ) = e iβh·H Φ ( x , x 4 ) e −iβh·H . Thus the above ansatz is consistent with Eq . ( B19 ) only if [ h · H , q ] = 0 . ( C7 )</p>

				<p>This equation implies that there are only n − 1 independent q &apos; s when the gauge symmetry is maximally broken or all h a are different .</p>

				<p>To consider the similar solution around magnetic monopoles , we again Fourier transform p</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We first consider the Nahm data for three monopoles which makes a single instanton on R 3 ×S 1 , or a caloron [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] . As shown in Appendix B , the Nahm equation is defined over three auxiliary time interval , [ t 1 , t 2 ] , [ t 2 , t 3 ] , [ t 3 , t 1 + 2π β ] , where β is the circumference of S 1 . The Nahm equation is almost trivial and the Nahm data gives the position vectors of magnetic monopoles as follows :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>T 1 = −x α = ( 0 , 0 , R ) , t ∈ ( t 1 , t 2 ) , T 2 = −x β = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , t ∈ ( t 2 , t 3 ) , T 3 = −x 3 = ( 0 , 0 , −K ) , t ∈ ( t 3 , t 1 + 2π β ) , ( D1 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where x α and x β are the positions of α and β monopoles , and x 3 is the position of the third monopole . For convenience , we put the third monopole at the z axis and later on take it to infinity by pushing K → ∞ . The distance between α and β monopoles are R .</p>

					<trash>The jumping condition ( B16 ) satisfied by this Nahm data as follows : w † 1 = 2 ( K + R ) 0 , w † 2 = 0 √ 2R , w † 3 = 0 √ 2K . ( D2 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Then one can find the A i , bφ field configurations by the ADHMN method , as explored in detail in</p>

				<p>Refs , [ 11 , 14 ] For given solutions of the corresponding ADHMN equation , there exist a general method to find the solution of the covariant four - dimensional Laplacian satisfied by the adjoint Higgs field , as summarized in Appendix C . For a single caloron as in our case , we need to find a continuous and periodic function p ( t ) on [ t 1 , t 1 + 2π β ] , for a given q ∈ SU ( 3 ) which commutes with the asymptotic Higgs value h · H . The differential equation ( C9 ) for the periodic p ( t ) in our context is given by</p>

					<trash>∂ 2 t p ( t ) − 2 ( K + D ) ( p ( t ) − q 1 ) δ ( t − h 1 ) −2D ( p ( t ) − q 2 ) δ ( t − h 2 ) − 2K ( p ( t ) − q 3 ) δ ( t − h 3 ) = 0 , ( D3 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where q = diag ( q 1 , q 2 , q 3 ) and q 1 + q 2 + q 3 = 0 . This equation is very simple to solve , especially in the limit where K → ∞ .</p>

				<p>where µ 2 = h 3 − h 2 and µ 1 = h 2 − h 1 , so that tr q T q R = 0 . For each q , there exists a corresponding p ( t ) . Especially in the relevant interval t ∈ [ h 1 , h 3 ] , for q T ,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The p T can be regarded case where p 1 = p 2 = 1 .</p>

				<p>Following the ADHMN method of the bφ field closely , as explored in Ref . [ 11 ] , we can solve easily the ADHMN equations ( B18 ) for a given Nahm data ( D1 ) and ( D2 ) . Especially one can see easily that the solutions ADHMN equation for the interval [ t 3 , t 1 + 2π β ] goes to zero like 1 / √ K , similar to the SU ( 2 ) case in Ref . [ 14 ] . Thus , there will be no nontrivial contribution from the interval [ t 3 , t 1 + 2π β ] . Then , we can now construct the solution of the second BPS equation ( 2 . 23 ) by using Eq . ( C10 ) of Appendix C . From Eq . ( C10 ) and the solution of the ADHMN equation in Ref . [ 11 ] , we can easily construct the 3 × 3 adjoint Higgs field which satisfies the second BPS</p>

				<p>Here we want to point out that energy density and total angular momentum become consider - ably simpler for the self - dual configurations . Using the self - dual equations , one can also simplify the energy density to be</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>H ( x ) = tr E 2 i + B 2 i + ( D 0 b · φ ) 2 + ( D i b · φ ) 2 + ( −ie [ a · φ , b · φ ] ) 2 = ∂ 2 i tr [ ( a · φ ) 2 + ( b · φ ) 2 ] ( E1 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where we used the result that D 0 ζ I = ie [ a · φ , ζ I ] = 0 .</p>

				<p>The most general BPS solutions carry both electric and magnetic charges and will have nonzero angular momentum in general . The angular momentum of a BPS configuration is</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>J i = −2 d 3 x ǫ ijk x j tr ǫ klm E l B m + D 0 φ I D k φ I = −2 d 3 x ( x j ∂ i − δ j i x l ∂ l ) tr ( a · φD j b · φ ) ( E2 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The angular momentum is a vector quantity and so should depend on the internal structure of the BPS configuration . While we do not pursue in the paper , we expect that both energy density and angular momentum can be simplified further .</p>
