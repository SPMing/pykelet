				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>Recently much progress has been made in calculating two-body low-energy constants (LECs) directly from QCD in the mesonic sector (see [1] for a recent review). Lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of two-meson interacting energies are performed and, using Lüscher &apos;s formalism[2], the scattering lengths are extracted. The exceptionally clean signals obtained in the mesonic sector have allowed for the extraction of pure three-body LECs [3, 4] using the multi-boson finite volume effects derived in [5, 6]. In the three-pion sector, the extracted three-body LEC is consistent with a repulsive three-body interaction[3]. Lüscher &apos;s formalism can be used to extract scattering phase shifts of two interacting baryons just as in the mesonic sector[7]. However, due to Pauli&apos;s exclusion principle, there is no general formula for relating LECs to interacting energy shifts for three (and more) fermions. In this proceeding I present finite volume effects for three identical spin-1/2 particles within a box, thereby generalizing Lüscher &apos;s formalism to three fermions. This analysis uses repulsive, short-ranged interactions of &apos;natural size&apos;, which is amenable to perturbation theory. Results are given for T 1 states that are accurate to order 1/L 5 , whereas results for A 1 and E states are accurate to order 1/L 4 . Here L is the length of a side of the box.</p>

				<p>In the next section I give a heuristic explanation of how to construct three-fermion states of definite cubic symmetry. The anti-symmetry restrictions makes this construction non-trivial. Section 3 then enumerates the perturbative results in powers of 1/L using these basis states. I conclude in sect. 4.</p>

				<head n="2">Constructing anti-symmetrised three-fermion states of good cubic symmetry 2.1 Jacobi basis</head>

				<p>The three-body single-particle eigenstates of the dimensionless kinetic energy operator T (in units of ε 0 = 4π 2 /mL 2 ) in a box of volume L 3 are given by | n 1 n 2 n 3 &gt;, where</p>

					<trash>ˆ T | n 1 n 2 n 3 &gt;= | n 1 n 2 n 3 &gt; n 2 1 2 + n 2 2 2 + n 2 3 2 . (2.1)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here n i = (n ix , n iy , n iz ) represents the wave number vector for the i th particle and I have assumed all particles have equal mass m. Other quantum numbers, such as spin (and isospin), have been suppressed. For reasons which will become apparent below, the single-particle states are now transformed to a Jacobi basis using</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>R 12 = r 1 − r 2 R 3 = r 3 − 1 2 ( r 1 + r 2 ) (2.2) R cm = 1 3 ( r 1 + r 2 + r 3 ) .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Here R 12 represents the relative motion between particles 1 and 2, R 3 represents the relative motion between particle 3 and the center-of-mass (CM) of particles 1 and 2, and R cm is the total CM</p>

				</figure>

				<p>shows this transformation schematically. Since interactions occur only between particles (I assume no external potential acting on the fermions) and typically only the lowest energy eigenstates are of interest, the utility of switching to the Jacobi basis is now manifest: one can simply set N cm = 0. Thus a three-body problem effectively becomes a &apos;two-body&apos; problem. All results in the following section use N cm = 0, though it is straightforward (but tedious) to generalize to nonzero CM motion. A subtle point comes about from the transformation to Jacobi basis since the box boundary conditions are originally defined in the single-particle basis. In the case when N cm = 0, for any component of N 3 which is odd, the corresponding component of N 12 must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions. Conversely, any component of N 3 which is even has the corresponding component of N 12 satisfying periodic boundary conditions. These restrictions can be derived by comparing the completeness relations within the single-particle basis and the Jacobi basis.</p>

					<trash>2.2 Three-body antisymmetrised states The states | N 12 N 3 &gt; (the index N CM is dropped since only zero CM motion is considered) are not anti-symmetric under exchange of any two particles. Anti-symmetric states are constructed by projecting onto the three-body anti-symmetriser, P 123 A = 1 3 P 12 A (1 − P 13 − P 23 ) , (2.5) Three Fermions in a Box Thomas Luu where P i j is the permutation operator that permutes particles i and j and P 12 A = 1 2 (1 − P 12 ) (2.6) is the two-body anti-symmetriser of particles 1 and 2. Note that Eq. 2.5 commutes with the parity operator. Thus the states of interest are ones that satisfy P 123 A |n i π &gt;= |n i π &gt; ,</trash>

				<p>The states |n i π &gt; are now anti-symmetrised but are not states of good cubic symmetry. Standard group-theoretical techniques can be used to obtain the appropriate linear combinations of |n i π &gt; such that the overall anti-symmetric state falls into one of the five irreducible representations (irreps) of the cubic group: A 1 , A 2 , E, T 1 , and T 2 [8]. A cursory description of this procedure is only given below.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Given the set of anti-symmetrised states |n i π &gt;, matrix elements of the cubic rotation operators R α are constructed using this basis, i.e. &lt; n j π|R α |n i π &gt;, forming a regular representation of the group. This regular representation consists of 24 matrices, all of dimension D n × D n . Traces of these matrices give five distinct characters χ R (r), and using the five characters of the irreps of the cubic group, χ IR (r), and the number of rotation elements in each irrep, n IR (r), the multiplicity of each irrep in this regular representation,</figDesc>

				<head n="4">Conclusion</head>

				<p>I have presented finite volume effects for three identical spin-1/2 fermions in a box interacting via short-ranged, repulsive interactions of &apos;natural&apos; size. Results are given for states in the first cubic shell n = 1 and are valid up to order 1/L 5 for the T 1 states and 1/L 4 for the A 1 and E states. These results generalize Lüscher &apos;s formalism to three spin-1/2 fermions in a box. A similar analysis can be performed on nucleons by the introduction of isospin degrees of freedom[9]. Here the spectra of states is extremely rich and the structure of the interactions is complex due to the presence of tensor forces and pure s-wave three-body interactions. Furthermore , at the physical pion mass the interactions are no longer of &apos;natural&apos; size and non-perturbative formalisms must be employed[9]. Ultimately, LQCD will answer current outstanding nuclear physics questions, such as the nature and origin of the tensor force and three-nucleon interaction. This work represents a necessary step towards obtaining these answers.</p>
