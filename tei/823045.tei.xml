				<p>Topologically massive gravity [1]—three-dimensional Einstein gravity supplemented by a gravitational Chern-Simons term in the action—provides an interesting playground in which to explore quantum gravity. In contrast to pure Einstein gravity in three dimensions, topologically massive gravity contains a propagating physical degree of freedom. It nevertheless appears to be renormalizable [2–4], perhaps offering a rare instance of a theory of spacetime geometry that can be treated by methods of conventional quantum field theory.</p>

				<p>With the addition of a negative cosmological constant, topologically massive gravity also provides a new realm in which to investigate the AdS/CFT correspondence [5–7]. In this setting, though, the theory has a dangerous instability: the local degree of freedom contributes to the energy with a sign opposite to that of the BTZ black hole [8], suggesting the absence of a ground state. Using the supersymmetric extension of topologically massive gravity, one can prove a positive energy theorem [9, 10], but only in the sector containing no black holes. As Li, Song, and Strominger have noted, however, the structure of the theory changes dramatically at a special &quot; chiral &quot; value of the coupling constants [7]. At this coupling, the propagating &quot; massive graviton &quot; modes become pure gauge, and can be eliminated by diffeomorphisms [11]. This presents a puzzle, since the constraint analysis shows the continued existence of a local degree of freedom [12, 13]. The answer is partially understood [14, 15]: precisely at the chiral coupling, a new set of local &quot; logarithmic &quot; modes appears in the linearized theory. * These modes violate the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions [17] usually imposed in (2+1)-dimensional asymptotically AdS gravity, and it has been argued that they can be eliminated by imposing suitable boundary conditions. If so, topologically massive gravity at the chiral coupling would become a truly chiral theory, closely related to a chiral half of ordinary Einstein gravity. But this leads to another puzzle. As demonstrated in [18], the logarithmic modes at the chiral coupling can be generated, at least in the linearized theory, from strictly local initial data. The imposition of Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions then becomes a teleological choice, a restriction on initial data &quot; now &quot; on the basis of its behavior in the future. A possible resolution, proposed in [19], could come from a linearization instability: although linearized initial data may have compact support, there is evidence that at the next order in perturbation theory, such data may violate suitably strong boundary conditions. Any resolution of these puzzles requires an understanding of the interplay between boundary conditions and nonlinearity in topologically massive gravity. In this paper, I find the general solution to the linearized field equations in a Poincaré coordinate patch, and show that it can be parametrized by solutions—or initial data—of a free scalar field whose mass lies at the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [20]. I then use this parametrization to investigate the questions of boundary behavior and linearization stability.</p>

This behavior is well-understood, though: precisely at m 2 = −1, a new solution appears with an asymptotic behavior ϕ ∼ z ln z.

The linearized curvature of h depends only on γ + , so the remaining piece of h is formally equivalent to a diffeomorphism; in fact, it is the most general diffeomorphism that preserves the gauge condition (2.6) at first order. The general solution of linearized topologically massive gravity at the chiral coupling in a Poincaré coordinate patch thus consists of three pieces: a dynamical degree of freedom parametrized by an extremal B-F scalar; a formal diffeomorphism (that need not satisfy the boundary conditions to make it &quot; pure gauge &quot; ); and a chiral logarithmic term h ++ = γ + (x + ) ln z corresponding to the pp-wave of [16, 18]</p>

				<p>At an initial time, the scalar field X may be chosen to have compact support away from the conformal boundary. Indeed, we can specify arbitrary initial data for X and ∂ t X and evolve it forward with the Klein-Gordon equation. As the system evolves, though, the field will reach the conformal boundary in a finite time, and we may ask about compatibility with boundary conditions. Note that we risk making a teleological argument here, that is, limiting initial data &quot; now &quot; on the basis of what the field will do in the future. Anti-de Sitter space is not globally hyperbolic, so initial data is not enough to determine a unique evolution. For the case of a free scalar, however, Ishibashi and Wald have shown that there is a finite-dimensional family of &quot; nice &quot; evolution laws, where niceness includes the existence of a positive energy, compatibility with time translation symmetry, and a set of convergence conditions [22]. In particular, for a scalar field ϕ = z 3 X at the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, the asymptotic behavior near z = 0 is ϕ ∼ a 0 z + b 0 z ln z + . . . , (3.1) and the allowed evolution laws correspond uniquely to choices of the ratio a 0 /b 0 . (Positivity imposes an interesting limit on this ratio, whose implications have not, as far as I know, been explored in the context of topologically massive gravity.) Each choice of an evolution law gives rise to a Greens function, and in principle one could use such a function to determine the future boundary behavior of X. Let us take a shortcut, and directly evaluate X—and hence h µν —near z = 0, keeping in mind that we are really looking at the future evolution of our compact initial data. Since X = ϕ/z 3 , the appropriate form of (</p>

The equations of motion (2.5) then yield α 1 = 1 2 ∂ + ∂ − (β 0 − α 0 ), β 1 = − 1 2 ∂ + ∂ − β 0 . (3.3) This, in turn, implies from (2.7) that h ++ ∼ − 2∂ + 2 β 0 z 2 − ∂ + 3 ∂ − (β 0 − 2α 0 ) + 2∂ + 3 ∂ − β 0 ln z + . . . h +− ∼ 2∂ + ∂ − β 0 z 2 + ∂ + 2 ∂ − 2 (β 0 − 2α 0 ) − 2∂ + 2 ∂ − 2 β 0 ln z + . . .

				<p>These asymptotics clearly violate standard boundary conditions, including both the original Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions for (2+1)-dimensional gravity [17] and the weaker logarithmic boundary conditions of [13,23]. We have not yet looked at the general solution, however; that is, we have not yet added in a term of the form (2.8). By inspection, we can cancel the 1/z 2 terms in (3.4) by choosing c = 2β 0 , a = −2β 0 , and b = 2β 0 − 8α 0 . The ln z/z 2 term in h −− cannot be canceled, though, and must be eliminated by imposing the condition</p>

				<p>consistent with the logarithmic asymptotics of [13, 23]. At first sight, the condition (3.5) appears to be a teleological restriction on our initial data. As noted earlier, however, a scalar field in anti-de Sitter space does not have a unique Greens function. In particular, one can choose a Greens function for which the coefficient b 0 in (3.1) vanishes for all initial data. If we assume &quot; nice &quot; evolution of X is in one-to-one correspondence with &quot; nice &quot; evolution of h ij —I will return to this assumption in the conclusion—then the corresponding choice eliminates β 0 in (3.4). ‡ With the proper choice of a Greens function, compact initial data for X thus evolves in a way that respects natural Brown-Henneaux or logarithmic boundary conditions. This is still a delicate issue, though, since the cancellation of the 1/z 2 terms in (3.4) required a &quot; diffeomorphism mode &quot; (2.8) which did not itself have compact support. A direct Greens function computation of the evolution of the full metric perturbation would thus still be valuable.</p>

				<head n="4">Linearization stability</head>

				<p>So far, we have only considered the linear approximation to topologically massive gravity. For the most part, physicists are used to situations in which a first-order solution of a set of equations can be extended to at least a perturbative solution of the full nonlinear equations. Sometimes, however, such an extension fails: a solution of a linearized set of field equations may not be the linearization of an exact solution.</p>

				<p>In such a case, the theory is said to have a linearization instability [24]. As a simple example, consider the equation x 2 = 0. If we expand around ¯ x, the linearized equation is ¯ xδx = 0; thus if we choose ¯ x = 0, δx is unconstrained at linear order, although only δx = 0 is a linearization of the exact solution x = 0. While the instances in physics are more complicated, this example illustrates the fundamental point: if one expands around too special a background, some of the linearized equations may vanish identically, and the first constraints may be quadratic.</p>

				<p>In ordinary general relativity, a linearization instability can occur if one expands around a background metric admitting Killing vectors. Recall that in d dimensions, d of the Einstein field equations are constraints; that is, when smeared against a vector ξ µ , they generate diffeomorphisms g µν → g µν + ∇ µ ξ ν + ∇ ν ξ µ . But if ξ µ is a Killing vector for a background metric ¯ g µν , this transformation is trivial at first order, and up to possible boundary terms, the corresponding generators vanish. In other words, if the background metric admits a Killing vector, certain combinations of the field equations first appear at second order. With particular boundary conditions , these second-order field equations may then restrict the allowed first-order perturbations; see [25, 26] for simple examples. Maloney, Song, and Strominger have argued in [19] that such a phenomenon occurs for topologically massive gravity at the chiral coupling. Their analysis used the nonlocal light front modes of [18], making the computations rather complex.</p>

				<p>The present B-F scalar formalism allows a straightforward check of their results.</p>

				<p>Now, recall from section 3 that a general solution h ij of the linearized field equations consists of three pieces, one determined by an extremal B-F scalar, one formally equivalent to a diffeomorphism , and one a chiral pp-wave depending on ln z. Of these, only the first permits arbitrary initial data of compact support, so let us begin with that piece. I show in the appendix that</p>

The integral I ξ of (4.5) is thus I (2) ξ = − 1 √ 2 dx dz 1 z ∂ z N (N + 2) 2 X 2 + 2 ∂ + N (N + 2) 2 X 2 + z=0 dx z −3 F (2)zt . (4.9)</trash>

				<p>In general, one must also consider terms involving the remaining two pieces iñ h ij , but I show in the appendix that these give only a boundary term that vanishes if X has compact support.</p>

				<p>In accord with the results of [19], we see that the &quot; bulk &quot; term in (4.9) is negative definite. The &quot; boundary &quot; term is precisely the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charge Q + [10, 27]. For the general logarithmic boundary conditions of [13, 23]</p>

				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>By the equations of motion, the total integral I ξ must vanish. Thus if our perturbation expansion remains valid throughout the Poincaré patch (so that we can separately require that I</figDesc>
					<trash>(2) ξ = 0) and if we can consistently restrict ourselves to Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions B(x + ) = 0, the bulk integrand in (4.9) must be zero: ∂ z N (N + 2) 2 X = ∂ + N (N + 2) 2 X = 0. (4.12) The general solution of (2.5) and (4.12) is X = α 0 z 2 + β 0 ln z z 2 + 1 2 ∂ + ∂ − (β 0 − α 0 ) + 1 2 ∂ + ∂ − β 0 ln z with ∂ + 2 ∂ − 2 α 0 = ∂ + 2 ∂ − β 0 = 0. (4.13) The resulting linearized curvature has nonvanishing components H −− = 8∂ − 2 β 0 z 2 + 2∂ + ∂ 3 − β 0 , H −z = 4∂ + ∂ − 2 β 0 z . (4.14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In particular, if we impose any reasonable AdS boundary conditions, we must require that ∂ − 2 β 0 = 0, which in turn implies that the entire linearized curvature tensor is zero. We thus confirm the results of [19]: if our perturbation expansion remains valid at z = 0, and if the sector Q + = 0 can be consistently treated as a superselection sector, then this sector exhibits a linearization instability, and only those linearized solutions with vanishing curvature can be extended to second order. Equivalently, if a metric perturbation with nonvanishing H µν has compact support at first order, the field equations force the second order perturbation to have a nonvanishing boundary contribution to the charge Q + , and hence a nonvanishing logarithmic term in the asymptotic expansion (4.10). If such a logarithmic term can be consistently forbidden by boundary conditions, such first order metric perturbations are thus excluded.</p>

				<p>Finally, let us note one more connection between chiral topologically massive gravity and scalar fields. The integral (4.9) that controls linearization instability depends on X only through</p>

				<p>. (4.16)</p>

				<p>It was noted in [18] that topologically massive gravity in light front coordinates can be described in terms of a single massless scalar field, at the expense of allowing nonlocal dependence of h µν on the field. We now see that the same is true in the present setting.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="5">Where we stand</head>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The heart of this paper has been a demonstration that the linearized solutions of topologically massive AdS gravity at the chiral coupling may be parametrized by a free scalar field at the Breitenlohner-Freedman mass bound. The peculiarities of the chiral coupling—in particular, the appearance of logarithmic solutions—reflect the behavior of such an extremal scalar. While light front gauge provides an alternative scalar parametrization [18]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>, the present form has the advantage of locality: the metric perturbations are now strictly local functions of the scalar X.</p>

				<p>Although this work has been carried out in a single Poincaré coordinate patch, there are no obvious obstructions to a similar construction in global coordinates. A scalar field at the B-F bound also appears in the description of exact pp-waves at the chiral coupling [28]; a further exploration of this relationship could be interesting.</p>

				<p>The importance of this new parametrization, of course, depends on what it can tell us about the physical puzzles of chiral topologically massive gravity. As we have seen, we can write down the general solution of the linearized equations of motion, and use this to confirm the claim of [19] that the Q + = 0 sector has a linearization instability that excludes the propagating bulk modes. At the same time, the positive energy theorem of [9, 10] suggests that another superselection sector may exist, in which black holes are excluded. We are thus left with a picture of a theory containing three sectors: a chiral (Q + = 0) sector with black holes but no bulk modes, requiring G &gt; 0 for positive energy; a sector with bulk modes but no black holes, requiring G &lt; 0 for positive energy; and a larger sector with the logarithmic boundary conditions of [13,23], in which the energy may not be bounded below for any G.</p>

				<p>To show this picture is correct, though, more work is needed. First, we do not know that the potential positive energy sectors are genuine superselection sectors that really decouple from the rest of the theory. In the chiral sector, the remaining linearized excitations are formal diffeomorphisms, which extend to exact solutions that are nontrivial only at the conformal boundary. Until the boundary dynamics is better understood, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that consistent interactions require that the Q + = 0 &quot; bulk &quot; modes be present at the boundary as well. In the &quot; no black holes &quot; sector, it is plausible that the positive energy bulk excitations cannot collapse to form negative energy black holes, but I know no proof that such processes are excluded. In the &quot; logarithmic &quot; sector, we know that energies are unbounded below at low orders of perturbation theory, but not whether nonperturbative bounds exist. Indeed, apart from investigations of the constraints and of solutions with special symmetries, work on this model has relied almost exclusively on perturbation theory. Efforts to prove, or disprove, a global positive energy theorem have not yet succeeded at the chiral coupling [29], and we cannot exclude the possibility of nonperturbative surprises. In particular, the low order analysis presented here, including the analysis of linearization instability, depends on the assumption that our perturbative expansion remains valid all the way out to z = 0, despite the presence of terms in the expansion with inverse powers of z. In some crude sense, we know this is not correct: if we choose a first-order solution with compact initial data, the second-order solution is generically nonzero all the way out to z = 0, so near the boundary h (2) dominates h (1) . At this order, this phenomenon is merely another indication of linearization instability, and it is plausible that it does not extend to higher orders, but a more careful and rigorous analysis is clearly needed.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Finally, the failure of asymptotically anti-de Sitter space to be globally hyperbolic has some subtle implications that may not be fully appreciated. As in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, one may start with initial data in a compact region and evolve it forward in time with a Greens function of one&apos;s choice to obtain a solution of the field equations near the initial time slice. In a non-globally hyperbolic spacetime, however, the resulting solution may not depend continuously on the initial data; that is, arbitrarily small changes in initial data may lead to large changes in the solution, invalidating any perturbative expansion [30]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>. § For a scalar field in anti-de Sitter space, Ishibashi and Wald have shown that this problem can be circumvented with a suitable choice of Greens functions [22], and I have used this result to determine the evolution of the scalar field X. But while the metric perturbations depend locally on X, the converse is not true, and it is not obvious that the evolution described here will always depend continuously on the initial data. For the full nonlinear theory, the situation is even less clear. Again, a much more careful and rigorous analysis is needed before we can be truly confident of any conclusions.</p>

Inserting (A.16)–(A.19) into (4.6), we see that |g| ξ µ E (2,bulk)− µ = z 3 (∂ + h +− ) 2 + ∂ + V + ∂ z U − (A.20) + z 3 2 h +− (N + 6) ∂ + 2 h +− − 1 2z 2 N (N + 2)h ++ − z 3 4 ∂ + h +− (N + 2)(∂ − h ++ + ∂ + h +− ), where V is as in (A.19) and U − = z 4 2 (∂ + h +− ) 2 + z 4 8 (∂ + h +− − ∂ − h ++ ) 2 + z 2 4 (h ++ (N − 2)N h +− − 2N h ++ N h +− + h +− N (N + 2)h ++ ) .

				<p>Now recall first that at first order, h has two contributions (2.7) and (2.8). The integral I (2) ξ will correspondingly have three contributions: one quadratic in X, one quadratic iñ h, and one cross term. Let us first consider the term quadratic in X.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>From (2.7), ∂ + 2 h +− − 1 2z 2 N (N + 2)h ++ = 0 ∂ − h ++ + ∂ + h +− = 0 (A.25) ∂ + ∂ − h +− + 1 2z 2 N (N + 2)h +− = 0 (N − 2)∂ − h +− + (N + 2)∂ + h −− = 0. Inserting (A.25) into (A.20) and (A.23) and combining to form the t component |g| ξ µ E (2,bulk)t µ , we immediately obtain (4.9).</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We next consider the contributions involving h. We could again use (A.20) and (A.23), but it is simpler to return to (4.6). Observe that the only nonvanishing contribution of h to the linearized curvature is H ++ = −γ + , so (4.6) will consist almost entirely of cross terms involving H[X]. Note also that if f (x + , x − ) is any z-independent function, then it follows from (A.1) that zf H ++ , zf H +− , zf H −− , z −1 f H +− , z −1 f H −− , f H z+ , and f H z− are all total z derivatives. It is then easy to check that the only remaining h-dependent contributions to |g| ξ µ E</p>

					<trash>(2)+ µ are |g| ξ µ E (2,bulk)+ µ = · · · + z 2 8 ∂ + 3 ∂ − 2 (2a − b − c)H z− + ∂ + 2 ∂ − 3 (2a − b − c)H z+ . (A.26) But H z− = z 2 (N + 2)(∂ + h −− − ∂ − h +− ) = −2zN (N + 2)∂ + ∂ − 2 X = 1 z (N − 2)N (N + 2) 2 ∂ − X H z+ = z 2 (N + 2)(∂ − h ++ − ∂ + h +− ) = −2z(N + 2) 2 ∂ + 2 ∂ − X = 1 z N 2 (N + 2) 2 ∂ + X, (A.27) so the terms in (A.26) are each of the form zf (x + , x − )(N + 2)g = ∂ z (z 2 f g). Similarly, the only h-dependent contributions to |g| ξ µ E (2)− µ that are not immediately recognizable as total z derivatives are |g| ξ µ E (2,bulk)− µ = . . . − z 2 8 ∂ + 4 ∂ − (2a − b − c)H z− + ∂ + 3 ∂ − 2 (2a − b − c)H z+ − z 2 ln z 2 ∂ + γ + H z− − z 2 γ + (N + 2)h +− . (A.28) − z 2 ln z 2 ∂ + γ + H z− = − z ln z 2 ∂ + γ + (N − 2)N (N + 2) 2 ∂ − X (A.29) = −∂ z z 2 ln z 2 ∂ + γ + (N − 2)N (N + 2)∂ − X + z 2 ∂ + γ + (N − 2)N (N + 2)∂ − X = −∂ z z 2 ln z 2 ∂ + γ + (N − 2)N (N + 2)∂ − X − z 2 2 ∂ + γ + (N − 2)N ∂ − X .</trash>

				<p>We thus conclude that as long as X has compact support, the terms involving h make no contribution to the integral I</p>
