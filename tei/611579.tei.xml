				<head>I. INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>The Fermilab Tevatron collider will define the high energy frontier of particle physics while CERN&apos;s Large Hadron Collider is being built. The first stage (Run IIa) of the Tevatron collider Run II (March 2001-2005) will deliver at least 2 fb −1 of integrated luminosity per experiment at √ s = 2 TeV. Major upgrades of the CDF and DØ detectors [1,2] have been completed and we have beeing taking data. In the second stage (Run IIb) of Run II (starting in 2006), we expect 15 fb −1 of integrated luminosity per experiment at 2 TeV. Further upgrades of the two detectors are been undertaken. Among various features, the detectors have the ability to trigger on displaced vertices from bottom and charm decays using a precise microvertex detector to enchance the Higgs search and the physics with top quarks. Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are among the main priorities along with Higgs and top physics for Run II. Supersymmetry uniquely opens the possibility to directly connect the Standard Model (SM) with an ultimate unification of the fundamental interactions. With the results on electrweak and strong gauge couplings from CERN&apos;s e + e − collider LEP experiments and the top quatk mass at CDF and DØ at the Tevatron, the models of SUSY have become more predictive and require a spectrum of new particles below a few TeV/c 2 . Thus SUSY represents a natural candidate for the new physics expected to occur in the TeV energy domain.</p>

				<p>In this paper, we summarize the prospects of SUSY searches/discovery either directly through collider processes or indirectly through rare processes at the Tevatron.</p>

				<head>II. SUSY MODELS</head>

				<p>One of the difficulties in determining predictions of generic Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) lies in the large number of new parameters (over 100 free parameters) the theory implies. One may consider a theoretical framework to reduce the number of free parameters.</p>

				<p>Fortunately SUSY models apply to a large number of different accelerator and cosmological phenomena, and a great deal of effort has been involved in recent years to use the data to limit the parameter space. Part of the difficulty in doing this resides in the success of the model in not disturbing the excellent agreement of the precision tests of the SM [3] due to the SUSY decoupling theorems which suppress SUSY contributions at low energies. Historically, the absence of flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level played an important role in the construction of the SM. They represent therefore an important class of phenomena that might show the presence of new physics, since the SM and the SUSY contributions contribute first at the loop level with comparable size. Thus the decay b → sγ has been a powerful tool in limiting the SUSY parameter space. Extensive Monte Carlo (MC) studies were carried out during 1998 on the following four topics to maximize the direct SUSY/Higgs searches in Run II: (i) supergravity (SUGRA) [4], (ii) Gauge-mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB) [5], (iii) beyond the MSSM [6], and (iv) Higgs [7]. The readers can refer to Ref. [8] for a summary of Run I SUSY searches. Among the experimental aspects, we conclude that it is important to have excellent triggering/tagging and identification for b&apos;s, τ &apos;s, γ&apos;s as well as e&apos;s and µ&apos;s. Thus we develop (A) low p T lepton+track trigger, where the &quot; track &quot; object can be electron, muon, or hadronically decaying τ -lepton, (B1) ≥2-jets trigger + E / T (&gt; 25 GeV) and (B2) ≥2-jets trigger + E / T (&gt; 20 GeV with b/c tagging), instead of inclusive E / T trigger, (C) better trigger/identification for prompt/displaced photons. Trigger B1 is extremely useful for reliable parametrization of high E / T distribution due to QCD events to reduce the systematic uncertainty [4]. We first consider mininal SUGRA (mSUGRA) and GMSB frameworks as examples of direct searches for SUSY production, which characterize the experimental triggers and analyses in b&apos;s, τ &apos;s, γ&apos;s. Details of all SUSY models and experimental prospects can be found in Refs. [4–6]. We then take the decay B s → µ + µ − as an example of powerful tool in limiting SUSY parameter space at the Tevatron.</p>

				<head>III. DIRECT SEARCHES A. Testing mSUGRA</head>

				<p>The mSUGRA model [9,10] depends on four parameters: m 0 (the universal scalar mass at M G ), m 1/2 (the universal gaugino mass at M G ), A 0 (the universal cubic soft breaking mass at M G ), and tan β (the ratio of two SUSY Higgs vacumm expectation values at the electroweak scale). In addition, the sign of µ (the Higgs mixing parameter) is arbitrary. With R parity invariance, the lightest neutralino ( ˜ χ 0 1 ) is assumed to be the lightest suppersymmetric particle (LSP) and it is bino-like and stable. The χ 0 1 then would pass through the detector without interaction. We fix A 0 = 0 and the sign of µ to be positive for simplicity, otherwise stated. Here the ISAJET sign convention for µ is used.</p>

				<head n="1">Chargino-Neutralino Associated Production</head>

				<p>The trilepton signal arises when both the lightest chargino ( ˜ χ ± 1 ) and the next-tolightest neutralino ( ˜ χ 0 2 ) decay leptonically in pp → ˜ χ ± 1 ˜ χ 0 2 + X. An initial study of the final state of trilepton (ℓℓℓ) plus E / T for high luminosity ( &gt; ∼ 10 fb −1 ) at the Tevatron was made in Ref. [11] for direct χ ± 1 ˜ χ 0 2 production. Here ℓℓℓ = eee, eeµ, eµµ, µµµ by excluding electron or muon from tau (τ ) lepton leptonic decay. Further studies were also made for pp → 3ℓ + X, including all SUSY production processes (e.g., ˜ ℓãnd its decays [12–14,4,15]. Electron or muon from the leptonic decay mode of τ lepton were accepted. This requires CDF and DØ experiments to trigger and identify the leptons with low p T ( &gt; ∼ 10 GeV/c). They also improved the SM background calculations including effects from W * , Z * , and γ * .</p>

				<p>The studies in Refs. [12,14,4,15] have included hadronically decaying τ lepton as well. This requires both experiments to trigger and identify the τ leptons with low p T ( &gt; ∼ 10 GeV/c). With high luminosity in Run II, an inclusive lepton trigger becomes FIG. 1. Regions of the m 1/2 -m 0 plane where the trilepton events should be detectable at a level of 5σ significance for tan β = 5 (left) and tan β = 50 (right) [15]. Three areas are shown for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb −1 (magenta), 10 fb −1 (blue) and 2 fb −1 (green) and from top to bottom, respectively. The large red regions are excluded by theory and experiment.</p>

				<p>Dashed lines represent the SUSY contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (in units of 10 −10 ) and the dotted lines are iso-mass contours of the lightest neutral Higgs boson. The solid contour (only for tan β = 50) indicates the prediction for the branching ratio Br[B s → µ + µ − ]. In the left (tan β = 5) plot the solid line indicates where M ˜</p>

				<p>more difficult because of such a large trigger rate. Thus a generic dilepton trigger, namely lepton + track trigger, is neccessary [4].</p>

				<p>In those studies, the final states of 3ℓ + E / T , ℓ ± ℓ ± + τ h + E / T are found to be the best channels for the study of chargino-neutralino associated production. Trigger A, mentioned earlier, will play a key role to maximize the experimental sensitivity in this channels. Figure 1 shows 5σ discovery reach in the trilepton channel in mSUGRA for small tan β = 5 and large tan β = 50. We will be sensitive upto</p>

				</figure>

				<p>It should be noted that the CDF and DØ analyses [16,17] of the trilepton channel in Run I (about 100 pb −1 ) were limited to tan β = 2, µ &lt; 0 within the MSSM framework.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>The chargino mass upto about 80 GeV/c 2 (m 1/2 = 75 GeV/c 2 ) was excluded for tan β = 2, µ &lt; 0 and A 0 = 0 if M ˜ q = M ˜ g within mSUGRA [18]. 2. Gluinos and Squarks Production Gluinos (˜ g) and squarks (˜ q) are pair-produced at the Tevatron. Within the mSUGRA framework, M ˜ q &gt; ∼ 0.85 M ˜ g . Thus, there appear two representative parameter regions in terms of the production: (i) ˜ g˜ g ˜ q, and q ¯ ˜ q productions where M ˜ q ≃ M ˜ g and (ii) ˜ g˜roduction where M ˜ q ≫ M ˜ g .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In most of the parameter space accessible at the Tevatron, the left-chiral squark dominantly decays into a quark and either a ˜ χ</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>± 1 or a ˜ χ 0 2 . Those branching ratios are B(˜ q L → q ′ ˜ χ ± 1 ) ≃ 65% and B(˜ q L → q ˜ χ 0 2 ) ≃ 30%. Since M ˜ q − M ˜ χ ± 1 &gt; M ˜ χ ± 1 − M ˜ χ 0 1 , the jet in the q L → q ′ ˜ χ ± 1 (or q L → q ˜ χ 0 2 ) decay likely has larger E T than those in the χ ± 1 → q ¯ q ′ ˜ χ 0 1 (or χ 0 2 → qq ′ ˜ χ 0 1 ) decay [19]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>. Similarly, at least one jet in the gluino decay (˜ g → q ¯</p>

				<p>through a real of virtual squark) has large E T . Thus, pairproduced squarks and gluinos have at least two large-E T jets associated with large E / T .</p>

				<p>Furthermore, the jet multiplicity tends to be larger for events with gluino than with squark. The final state with lepton(s) is possible due to leptonic decays of the χ ± 1 and/or χ 0 2 . The branching ratio to the final state with two or more leptons strongly depends on the value of tan β. This leads us to look for SUSY events with final states of from jets + E / T and 1ℓ + jets + E / T (ℓ = e or µ) [20]. We restrict the parameter space so that lighter third generation squarks ( ˜ b 1 and t 1 ) remain heavier than the χ ± 1 and the χ 0 2 .</p>

				<p>In the 1ℓ + jets + E / T channel, the gluino mass limits are less stringent than those in the jets + E / T channel [20], except for smaller m 0 values. It will be essential to combine limits from the two channels to maximize the sensitivity in Run II. It should be noted that the DØ and CDF analyses of the jets + E / T channel within the mSUGRA framework (A 0 = 0) in Run I were limited to tan β = 3, µ &lt; 0 [21,22].

In contrast, lighter sbottom ( ˜ b 1 ) can appear only at small m 0 and small m 1/2 in the mSUGRA models. In addition, they are always accompanied by light stops, except tan β &gt; 20 and µ &lt; 0. For general studies, we simply assume eithe b 1 or t 1 is the lightest squark. A comprehensive study on prospects of those searches can be found in Refs. [24,4].

Testing GMSB</trash>

					<figDesc>The GMSB models are generally distinguished by the presence of a nearly massless Goldstino ( ˜ G) as the LSP. The next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) decays to its partner and the G. Depending on the SUSY breaking scale (</figDesc>
					<trash>√ F ) , these decays occur promptly ( √ F &lt; ∼ a few 100 TeV) or on a scale comparable to the size of a collider detector (a few 100 TeV &lt; ∼ √ F &lt; ∼ a few 1000 TeV). For √ F much larger than a few 1000 TeV, the NLSP decay takes place well outside a collider detector and are not directly relevant to accelerator physics. Thus we consider a systematic analysis based on a classification in terms of the identity of the NLSP and its decay length within the minimal GMSB models. The models can be specified in terms of six parameters [5]</trash>

				<p>The ultimate limit for the SUSY mass reach of a hadron collider , resulting from the distribution function of the constituent quarks and gluons , is ∼ 25% of its collider energy .</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Thus the Tevatron approaches its limit below 450 GeV / c 2 ( about 50% √ s ) in the</trash>

					<figDesc>discovery of the SUSY particles . This would be similar to the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron ( SppS ) that approached its limit in the discovery of the W and Z bosons . IV . DETECTION OF B s → µ + µ −</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>We consider now the possibility of detecting the decay B s → µ + µ − by the CDF and DØ detectors at the Tevatron in Run II [ 32 ] . Both detectors have been upgraded with excellent tracking and muon detector systems [ 33 ] . The dimuon trigger is the key to collect the B s → µ + µ − decays .</p>

				<p>This process is particularly interesting for several reasons : The SM branching ratio is quite small , i . e . , Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] SM = 3 . 5×10 −9 [ 33 ] . The SUSY contribution [ 34 – 40 ] has terms that grow as tan 6 β and thus can become quite large for large tan β . Finally , as we shall show below , the two collider detectors will be sensitive to this decay for tan β &gt; ∼ 30 in Run II .</p>

				<p>In order to estimate the limits on Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] detection , we use the 95% C . L . limit on Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] published by CDF [ 41 ] . Thus our discussion is based on the CDF detector , although both CDF and DØ detectors should have a similar perfromance .</p>

				<p>In the Run I analysis , CDF observed one candidate that was consistent with B s → µ + µ − with an estimate of 0 . 9 backound ( BG ) events in 98 pb −1 [ 41 ] . The primary Run - I selection variables and cut values were cτ ≡ L xy M B / p µµ T &gt; 100 µm , I ≡ p µµ T / [ p µµ T + Σp T ] &gt; 0 . 75 for the muon pair , and ∆Φ &lt; 0 . 1 rad . Here , L xy is the transverse decay length ; p µµ T is the transverse momentum of the dimuon system . Σp T is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks , excluding the muon candidates , within a cone of ∆R ≡ ( ∆η ) 2 + ( ∆φ ) 2 = 1 around the monetum vector of the muon pair . The z coordinate of each track along the beam line [ 42 ] must be within 5 cm of the primary vertex . ∆Φ is an opening azimuthal angle between p µµ T and the vector pointing from the primary vertex to the secondary vertex ( the reconstructed B - meson decay position ) . As a conservative estimate , CDF took the one event as signal to calculate 95% C . L . limit of signal events ( N</p>

				</figure>

				<p>) and had set a limit of Br &lt; 2 . 6 × 10 −6 .</p>

				<p>In the analysis , the selection efficiency ( ǫ ) for signal events and the rejection power ( R ) for background events ( pass a baseline selection [ 41 ] ) are estimated to be ǫ 1 = 0 . 45 and R 1 = 440 by using a sample of like - sign dimuon events ( 5 &lt; M µµ &lt; 6 GeV / c 2 ) .</p>

				<p>In Run II , a dimuon trigger in Ref . [ 33 ] will improve the acceptance for signal events by a factor of 2 . 8 . The trigger will soon be tested using the Run IIa ( 2 fb −1 ) data . This will allow us to modify the trigger design for the higher luminosity expected in Run IIb ( 15 fb −1 ) .</p>

				<p>In this paper , we assume that the dimuon trigger can be designed by maintaing the acceptance for signal events . We expect to improve the acceptance for signal events by a factor of 2 . 8 [ 33 ] . If we assume the factor 2 . 8 to be the same for BG events , then we would observe 51 ( 386 ) events in 2 ( 15 ) fb −1 with the same cuts as in Run I . Therefore , CDF has to require a set of tighter cuts to obtain the best possible upper limit . Two types of backgrounds must be taken into account : ( i ) non - b backgrounds comming from the primary vertex ; ( ii ) b background events , such as the gluon - spliting bb events . One way to reduce prompt background is to require a minimum decay length L xy .</p>

				<p>However , two tracks can appear to form a secondary vertex if one of two tracks origi - nates from the primary vertex and the other has an impact parameter ( δ ) . Therefore , the requirement of a minimal impact parameter of individual tracks can further clean up the sample . It has been shown for example , in the Run - I analysis for B 0 → K 0 * µ + µ − events [ 43 ] , that a tight impact parameter cut on significance for individual track ( δ / σ δ &gt; 2 ) significantly improve the background rejection even with L xy &gt; 100 µm .</p>

				<p>One has then ǫ ∼ ǫ 1 × 0 . 43 and R ∼ R 1 × 190 . Thus a higher track impact parameter is neccessary to reduce the non - b backgrounds . We would expect larger reduction with good efficiency even after the L xy cut . The silicon vertex detector ( SVX - II ) will provide us much better reduction for the non - b background than Run I .</p>

				<p>The most severe background in Run II will be the two muons from gluon - spliting bb events . Since both particles are b quarks , the impact parameter does not help . Both b and b also go in the same direction , so that cut on L xy does not help either . However , ∆Φ is still usefull to remove the background events . Furthermore , in Run II , we can use ∆Θ in r - z view since we have z - strips in SVX - II . There is some room to improve the isolation cut . We can form a new isolation parameter by only using the tracks with large impact parameter . This new isolation cut will work to reject the bb rather than non - b background . Furthermore , we can search for tracks with large impact parameter on the opposite side of the dimuon candidates to make sure that the b and b go to the opposite side . Therefore , CDF could improve the BG rejection by a factor of 200 - 400 with further reduction of the signal efficiency by a factor of 2 - 3 . Based on these facts , we now consider two cases to evaluate Run II limits as a function of luminosity .</p>

				<p>In the first case ( Case A ) , we naively assume new tighter cuts in Run II , described above , will gain additional BG rejection power of 450 for additonal efficiency of 0 . 45 , or R 2 = 450 0 . 45 / ǫ 2 . This gives us ǫ 2 ǫ 1 = 1 1 + log ( R 2 / R 1 ) / log ( 450 ) ( 1 )</p>

				<p>If we could optimize the BG rejection in Run IIa ( 2 fb −1 ) to be R 2 ≈ 51R 1 with ǫ 2 ≈ 0 . 61ǫ 1 ( from Eq . 1 ) , then we would expect one BG event in 2 fb −1 . Thus , with an assumption of the same size of the total systematic uncertainty in Run II as in Run I , we can extrapolate the 95% C . L . limit to be</p>

					<trash>Br &lt; 7 . 7 × 10 −8 for 2 fb −1 using N 95% 1</trash>


				</figure>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>.</head>

				<p>In the second case ( Case B ) , we simply assume the Run - II background rejection could be improved ( without loosing the signal efficiency ) to keep the expected BG events in 2 fb −1 at the level of Run I ( i . e . , 0 . 9 events ) . If we would observe one event in 2 fb −1 , then we could set the limits by scaling the Run - I Br limit down by the luminosity ( 2000 pb −1 / 98 pb −1 ) and the acceptance by ( 2 . 8 / 1 . 0 ) . Thus we obtain Br &lt; 4 . 6×10 −8 . This would certainly be the optimistic scenario , but it would be a goal of this analysis in Run IIa . Here , the systematic uncertainty in Run II is assummed to be the same as in Run I . We repeat the same argument for different luminosities . Figure 3 shows 95% C . L . limits on Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] at CDF in Run II as a function of integrated luminosity for Cases A and B . For 15 fb −1 in case A , CDF would be sensitive to Br &gt; 1 . 2 × 10 −8 and the combined CDF and DØ data ( 30 fb −1 ) would be sensitive to Br &gt; 6 . 5 × 10 −9 .</p>

				<p>We examine first the parameter region for the mSUGRA model that would be accessible to CDF or DØ at Run II with 15 fb −1 of data . Figure 4 ( left ) shows the Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] as a function of m 1 / 2 for A 0 = 0 , m 0 = 300 GeV . One sees that with a sensitivity of Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] &gt; 1 . 2 × 10 −8 for 15 fb −1 , the Tevatron Run II can probe the B s → µ + µ − decay for tan β &gt; 30 . Further , a search for this decay would sample much higher regions of m 1 / 2 than a direct search at Run II for SUSY particles which FIG . 3 . Illustrated 95% C . L . limits on the branching ratio for B s → µ + µ − at CDF in Run II as a function of integrated luminosity [ 32 ] .

				<p>is restricted to m 1 / 2 &lt; 250 GeV [ 13 ] . As m 0 increases , the branching ratio goes down . However , this dependence becomes less significant for large m 1 / 2 , where m 0 as large as 800 GeV can be sampled for large m 1 / 2 .</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Figure 4 ( right ) the contours of Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] are plotted in the m 0 - m 1 / 2 plane for tan β = 50 , A 0 = 0 . Also see Figure 1 . We combine now this result with the other experimental constraints . Thus the shaded region to the left is ruled out by the b → sγ constraint , and the shaded region on the right hand side is disallowed if a SUGRA µ &gt; 11 × 10 −10 . The narrow shaded band in the middle is allowed by the dark matter constraint . We note that independent of whether the astronomically observed dark matter is SUSY in origin , the dark matter allowed region for mSUGRA cannot significantly deviate from this shaded region , for below the narrow shaded band , the stau would be lighter than the neutralino ( leading to charged dark matter ) , while above the band , mSUGRA would predict more neutralino dark matter than is observed .</p>

				<p>Using our estimate that Br &gt; 1 . 2 × 10 −8 can be observed with 15 fb −1 , we see that almost the entire parameter space allowed by the a µ &lt; 11 × 10 −10 constraint can be probed in Run II for tan β = 50 . Note that an observed Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] &gt; 7 × 10 −8 , possible with only 2 fb −1 ( see Figure 3 ) , would be sufficient to rule out the mSUGRA model for tan β ≤ 50 . In Figure 4 ( right ) we also show the expected dark matter detector cross section for Milky Way dark matter ( the short solid lines ) . For tan β = 40 and A 0 = 0 , we see about half the parameter space can be scanned by the CDF detector ( and the whole parameter space with 30 fb −1 if a similar analysis holds for the DØ detector ) . We note , further , that if A 0 = 0 , a simultaneous measurement of both</p>

				<p>requiring that they intersect with the dark matter allowed band at a point . ( If no choice of parameters allowed this , mSUGRA would be ruled out . ) The Tevatron Run II should be able to either rule out a Higgs mass or give evidence for its existence at the 3σ level over the entire allowed mass range of SUSY light Higgs masses . Alternatively , the LHC &apos; s determination of m h or the gluino mass ( to determine m 1 / 2 ) would fix the parameters of mSUGRA . Thus if a µ increases , the bound moves downward , encroaching further on the allowed part of the parameter space , and a value of a µ &gt; ∼ 50 × 10 −10 would eliminate the mSUGRA model [ 44 ] . However , if a µ decreases significantly ( but is still positive ) , the mSUGRA model would predict a heavy SUSY particle spectra closer to the TeV region , having significant effects on accelerator and dark matter detection physics . An accurate determination of a µ corresponds to a line from upper left to lower right ( or more precisely a band when errors are included ) running parallel to the a µ &lt; 11×10 boundary , and cutting through the allowed dark matter band which runs from lower left to upper right . Thus , these two experiments are complementary for determining the mSUGRA parameters . It is also pointed out that the B s → µ + µ − decay is very powerful in testing the SUSY breaking mechanism [ 45 ] . If the B s → µ + µ − decay is observed with Br &gt; 10 −8 , the Tevatron could exclude ( i ) GMSB models ( with tan β &lt; 40 and lower N m ) and ( ii ) minimal AMSB models .</p>

				<p>Interestingly , unlike the R parity conserving models , the SUSY contribution to B s → µ + µ − can occur at the tree level in the R parity violation models . The Br [ B s → µ + µ − ] can be large for both small and large tan β . We , for example , consider lepton violating terms [ 46 ] , and so we set λ ′′ to zero ( to prevent rapid proton decay ) .</p>

				<p>: trilepton final state as production of charginos and neutralinos for lower tan β values and the rare decay mode B s → µ + µ − for large tan β values . Especially , the B s → µ + µ − decay is an important process for SUSY searches , as the Standard Model prediction of the branching ratio is quite small ( 3 . 5 × 10 −9 ) , and the SUSY contribution increases for large tan β as tan 6 β . We find that a Br &gt; 1 . 2 × 10 −8 for 15 fb −1 can be probed by each collider detector in Run II . ( This is nearly a factor of 100 improvement over the Run I bound . ) For the mSUGRA model , the above sensitivity implies that Run II could probe a region of parameter space for tan β &gt; 30 , a region which could not be probed by a direct search at Run II . A large branching ratio , i . e . , &gt; 7 × 10 −8 ( 14 × 10 −8 ) would be sufficient to eliminate the mSUGRA model for tan β ≤ 50 ( 55 ) if one combined the expectations for B s → µ + µ − for mSUGRA with other experimental bounds on the parameter space .</p>
