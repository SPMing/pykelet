				<p>We quantize massive vector theory in such a way that it has a well-defined massless limit. In contrast to the approach by Stückelberg where ghost fields are introduced to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance, we use reduced phase space quantization with nonlocal dynamical variables which in the massless limit smoothly turn into the photons, and check explicitly that the Poincare algebra is fullfilled. In contrast to conventional covariant quantization our approach leads to a propagator which has no singularity in the massless limit and is well behaved for large momenta. For massive QED, where the vector field is coupled to a conserved fermion current, the quantum theory of the nonlocal vector fields is shown to be equivalent to that of the standard local vector fields. An inequivalent theory, however, is obtained when the reduced nonlocal massive vector field is coupled to a nonconserved classical current.</p>

				<p>Massless theories, such as gauge theories, are well-known to be plagued by infrared singularities . A possible, very clean way to handle the infrared catastrophe of gauge theories is to give the gauge field a small mass and take the massless limit after the observable quantities have been calculated. The quantization of the corresponding massive vector theory in such a way that it has a well defined massless limit is therefore important for investigations of the infrared behaviour of gauge theories, such as the formation of Lorentz and gauge invariant condensates. But a well defined massless limit is not straightforward because the covariant propagator of massive vector theory [1, 2] D</p>

				<p><formula>µν (q) = − 1 q 2 − M 2 g µν − q µ q ν M 2 . (1)</formula></p>

				<p>has a singularity at M=0. Furthermore the second term leads to ultraviolet divergences for large momenta. However, when the vector field is coupled to a conserved current (like in massive QED) (q µ J µ = 0) the badly behaved second term drops out and the theory becomes renormalizable.</p>

				<p>Already in 1957, Stückelberg [3] has proposed a Lagrangian for massive QED that can be quantized in such a way that it has a well defined massless limit. For this purpose he introduced additional ghost fields in order to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance. The cost of introducing these spurious degrees of freedom is that one finally has to verify that the observable quantities are not effected in the massless limit. This can be very difficult for complicated theories such as massive non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories [4]. We shall show in this paper that in the framework of reduced phase space quantization [5]-[10] a quantum theory of massive vector fields with a well defined massless limit can be obtained, without the introduction of any additional unphysical degrees of freedom. In the scheme of reduced phase space quantization one first eliminates all unphysical degrees of freedom from the classical theory and then quantizes only the physical variables. For massless QED reduced phase space quantization corresponds to quantization in the Coulomb gauge. Here only the two transverse components of the gauge field and the fermion field are quantized. Since through this reduction the manifest Poincaré invariance of the theory is lost, it is necessary to check whether the Poincaré algebra is satisfied both on the classical and on the quantum level. Zumino [6] has proven that QED in the Coulomb gauge satisfies the quantum Poincaré algebra and has shown that the quantum Lorentz transformation properties of the transverse gauge fields agree with the corresponding classical ones. Massive vector theory contains three dynamical degrees of freedom. As for the case of a massless gauge field the Lagrangian of massive vector theory does not contain the time derivative of the time component V 0 of the vector field. The Euler-Lagrange equation for V 0 is thus not a dynamical equation of motion but a constraint. The reduced Lagrangian obtained by eliminating V 0 from the Lagrangian using the constraint equation then contains the three spatial components of the vector field and their time derivatives. The question which arises then is about the choice of the dynamical degrees of freedom. For the solution of the above mentioned problem of a well defined massless limit we shall use instead of the three local components V k (k=1,2,3) the nonlocal fields V R k [ V ]</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We call the fields V R k &quot; reduced &quot; fields. In the massless limit the operator P becomes a projection operator onto the transverse components of the gauge fields. We shall show in this paper that the reduced massive vector fields satisfy the quantum Poincaré algebra and have the same Lorentz transformation properties in the massless limit as the photons. Furthermore we shall obtain the corresponding propagator for the reduced fields</p>

				<p>which is nonsingular in the massless limit and at the same time well behaved for large momenta. It includes an instantaneous Yukawa potential and turns into the Coulomb gauge propagator in the massless limit. Reduced phase space quantization in terms of reduced fields is the M = 0 generalization of Coulomb gauge quantization of QED, just as the Stückelberg approach is the corresponding generalization of covariant quantization of QED in the Lorentz gauge. For the case when the vector field is coupled to a conserved current (q µ J µ = 0), as in QED, the two ways of quantization, local and nonlocal, lead to equivalent quantum theories, J µ D R µν J ν = J µ D µν J ν . When the massive vector field however is coupled to a nonconserved classical current, the two alternative ways of quantization, local and nonlocal, will lead to inequivalent theories. Our paper is organized as follows: In Section II we perform the reduction of the Lagrangian for free massive vector theory and investigate the Lorentz transformation properties of the local as well as of the nonlocal reduced quantum fields. In Section III we discuss massive QED, where the massive vector field is coupled to a conserved fermion current, and show that the quantization in terms of the nonlocal reduced fields is equivalent to the conventional quantization in terms of local fields. In Section IV we show that massive vector theory, when coupled to a nonconserved classical current, may yield inequivalent quantum theories for the two alternative scenarios of quantization. In Section V we give our conclusions and outline possible applications. In Appendix A the classical Lorentz transformation properties are briefly discussed.</p>

					<trash>2 Free massive vector theory 2.1 Reduction of the Lagrangian The classical action of the free massive vector theory is given by W [V µ ] = d 4 xL(x) = d 4 x − 1 4 F µν F µν + 1 2 M 2 V 2 µ (5)</trash>

				<p>≡ − 1 2 ǫ ijk F jk = ǫ ijk ∂ j V k , (7) where the dot denotes the time derivative.</p>

				<p>As in the case of massless electrodynamics, one of the Euler-Lagrange equations, namely that corresponding to V 0 is a constraint rather than an equation of motion. In the method of reduced phase space quantization well known for gauge theories [5]-[10], which we shall in this paper apply to massive vector theory, one first eliminates the constraint variable V 0 from the Lagrangian before quantization of the theory. In QED this naturally leads to a reduction of the variables to the physical transverse photons. In the following we shall investigate to which physical variables this reduction leads for the case of massive vector theory.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>The Euler-Lagrange equation for V 0 is a constraint δW δV 0 = 0 ↔ ( ∂ 2 − M 2 )V 0 = −∂ i ˙ V i . (8) and corresponds in the massless limit to Gauss law. It can be solved for V 0 as V 0 [ V ] = − 1 ∂ 2 − M 2 ∂ i ˙ V i (9) and inserted into the original Lagrangian. Here we have abbreviated 1 ∂ 2 − M 2 f ( x) ≡ − 1 4π d 3 y e −M | y− x| | y − x| f ( y) . (10) The electric field E then becomes E k [ V ] = −R kj ˙ V j (11) with the reduction operator R ij ≡ δ ij − ∂ i ∂ j ∂ 2 − M 2 = δ T ij − M 2 ∂ 2 − M 2 δ || ij (12)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where we have used the longitudinal and transverse projection operators (3). In contrast to the massless case, R ij is not a projection operator, R 2 = R, but</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>R ij R jl = R il + M 2 ∂ i ∂ l ∂ 2 − M 2 2 (13) and R ij is invertible R −1 ij = δ T ij − ∂ 2 − M 2 M 2 δ || ij = δ ij − ∂ i ∂ j M 2 . (14)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the massless limit however the reduction operator becomes the transverse projection operator for photons and ceases to be invertible. The reduced action W red [ V ] ≡ W [V µ ] V 0 =V 0 [ V ]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>≡ d 4 xL red (15) therefore reads W red [ V ] = d 4 x 1 2 ˙ V i R ij ˙ V j − V i ∂ 2 − M 2 R ij V j , (16)</trash>

				<p>where in the second line we have used partial integration and formula (13). Massive vector theory has three dynamical variables. A possible choice are the three local spatial fields V k and their canonical conjugate momenta</p>

				<p>As mentioned above they yield a propagator that leads to a renormalizable theory only when coupled to conserved currents.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>One can see that the massless limit exists and leads to the reduced Lagrangian of free electromagnetism with the two transverse gauge fields A T k representing the physical variables . For this case of massless QED, Zumino [6] has proven that the transverse gauge fields fulfill the quantum Poincare algebra and has determined their Lorentz transformation properties. The Lorentz transformation properties of quantum and classical fields coincide only for the nonlocal A T k [V ] = δ T kj A j , but not for the local A k .</p>

				<p>In view of formula (12) for the electric field another possible choice is the nonlocal &quot; physical &quot; fields V R k [ V ]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>≡ R kj V j = δ T kj − M 2 ∂ 2 − M 2 δ || kj V j . (20)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The nonlocal V R i differ from the local V i in that their longitudinal components are shortened relative to those of V i . In the massless limit they are shortened to zero or projected out and reduce to the transverse gauge fields. We shall therefore call these nonlocal V R i reduced fields. In terms of these nonlocal variables the action is</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In the following section we would like to investigate the Lorentz transformation properties of the massive fields V k and V R k . We shall show that for both choices the equations of motion and the Lorentz transformation properties of the classical and quantum fields coincide. Only the nonlocal reduced V R k , however, have the same Lorentz transformation properties in the massless limit as the gauge fields.</p>

				<p>We would now like to quantize the classical theory in such a way that we have an exact correspondence between the classical and quantum fields with respect to both their equations of motion and their Lorentz transformation properties. In order to investigate the Lorentz transformation properties of the fields it is necessary to construct the energy momentum tensor corresponding to the Lagrangian (5). Using Noether&apos;s theorem one finds the canonical energy momentum tensor</p>

				<p>Replacing in Θ µν the V 0 in terms of the spatial V k via (9) according to our reduction method we obtain the reduced components Θ red µν ≡ Θ µν V 0 =V 0 [ V ] . (30)</p>

				<p>In the following we shall investigate both the quantization in the local and in the nonlocal reduced fields. We have to check whether the Poincaré algebra is fulfilled in both cases. For convenience we shall in the remainder of the paper drop the index &quot; red &quot; from the Θ µν .</p>

				<p>Quantization in the local V k</p>

				<p>In this section we shall briefly review the standard quantization in the local fields V k and Π k and the fulfillment of the corresponding Poincaré algebra. For a more detailed discussion see e.g. [1]. The local fields, V k , and their canonical conjugate momenta, Π k , are quantized by imposing the canonical commutation relations i[Π k ( x, t), V j ( y, t)] = δ kj δ( x − y) (31) with all other commutators vanishing. In terms of V i and Π i the four relevant components of the Belinfante tensor are obtained from (25) by replacing V 0 in terms of the spatial V k via (9) and then replacing the velocities R ij ˙ V j by the momenta Π i according to (</p>

We obtain the Heisenberg equations ˙ V R k ( x, t) = i[H R , V R k ( x, t)] = R kj Π R j , ˙ Π R k ( x, t) = i[H R , Π R k ( x, t)] = ( ∂ 2 − M 2 )R −1 ij V R j , (49) and thus again the Klein-Gordon equations: ¨ V R k = ( ∂ 2 − M 2 )V R k , (50) in formal agreement with the classical case. Furthermore we find the standard transformation i[P R k , V R i ( x, t)] = −∂ k V R i under spatial translations. For the Lorentz transformation properties we find δ L V R k = iǫ i [K R i , V R k ] = ǫ i (x i ∂ t + t∂ i )V R k − ∂ k 1 ∂ 2 − M 2 ǫ i ˙ V R i , (51)</trash>

				<p>in agreement with the classical form discussed in Appendix A. In contrast to the local fields, the Lorentz transformation properties of the nonlocal V R k [V ] = R kj V j reduce to those of the photon field in the massless limit.</p>

				<p>Comparing these with the corresponding transformation of the local fields, (41), we see that we have consistently δ L V R k = R kl (δ L V k ) in accordance with V R k = R kj V j . Careful, lengthy calculations show that the generators in the nonlocal variables also satisfy the Poincaré algebra, in particular the boost-boost commutator is correct, since here too</p>

					<figDesc>In summary, we have confirmed the Poincaré invariance of both ways of quantization, in terms of the local and the nonlocal reduced fields. All quantum transformation properties are in exact formal agreement with the corresponding classical ones. Quantization in terms of the nonlocal reduced fields is therefore a perfectly acceptible alternative to the standard quantization in terms of the local fields. The quantum theory of the nonlocal reduced fields has the very important property that in the massless limit it smoothly reduces to the photon theory.</figDesc>

				<p>Massive vector theory coupled to a classical current We have seen in the preceeding section that quantization in terms of the nonlocal reduced fields and conventional quantization in terms of the local vector fields lead to equivalent quantum theories, when coupled to a conserved current, as is the case for massive QED. On the other hand we observe that for the case of nonlocal fields current conservation is used -via the dynamics of the fermions -only initially in order to obtain the reduced Lagrangian (61) in terms of the nonlocal reduced fields from the original Lagrangian (53). Namely it was necessary to cancel the second term in (57) by a nonlocal phase transformation of the fermion field. Once the reduced Lagrangian has been obtained, however, current conservation has not been made use of anymore explicitly, e.g. for the derivation of the operator Klein-Gordon equation (85), in contrast to the corresponding local case (72). Furthermore, the nonlocal propagator (115) is well-defined even if coupled to a nonconserved current in contrast to the covariant local propagator (103). We shall now show that starting from the reduced Lagrangian (61) in terms of the nonlocal fields and coupling it to a nonconserved classical current instead of the conserved fermion current of QED, we may obtain a quantum theory which is inequivalent to the corresponding one in terms of the local field operators.

				<p>It is obtained from the reduced Lagrangian (61) of massive QED in terms of the reduced nonlocal fields by replacing the coupling to the conserved fermion current of QED by the coresponding coupling to the classical current.

				<p>We have considered the quantization in terms of reduced nonlocal fields, which reduce to the transverse photon fields in the massless limit. We have proven the Poincaré invariance of the corresponding quantum theory by a calculation analogous to that by Zumino for the massless case. The quantum Lorentz transformation properties of the nonlocal reduced fields have been derived and shown to coincide with the corresponding classical ones. Furthermore in the massless limit they smoothly turn into the Lorentz transformation properties of the photons. We obtain a theory that differs from the standard theory in terms of the local fields by the form of the vector particle propagator (115), which is the M = 0 generalization of the photon propagator in Coulomb gauge QED. It includes an instantaneous Yukawa potential in generalization of the Coulomb potential, has no mass singularity, and is well behaved for large momenta. The two schemes of quantization, local and nonlocal, coincide when coupled to a conserved current as in QED. However, in contrast to the quantization in the local vector fields, the quantization in the nonlocal reduced fields has a well behaved propagator in the infrared and the ultraviolet region, even if coupled to a nonconserved current, such as a classical nonconserved current. In this case the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitudes are different for the reduced nonlocal and the local massive vector fields. Other important examples of theories were the vector field is coupled to a nonconserved current are massive non-Abelian theories. Although there seems to be general consensus that they are nonrenormalizable beyond one loop order [2], it might be interesting to extend our concept of nonlocal reduced fields to the massive non-Abelian case as an alternative to recent covariant approaches [4] related to that of Stückelberg . The corresponding preprojection operator for massive non-Abelian theories of course will be much more complicated.</p>

				<p>Comparing our physical, reduced approach with the covariant one by Stückelberg , we first note that reduced phase space quantization of massive QED in the reduced fields in the massless limit smoothly turns into the quantization of QED in the Coulomb gauge, whereas the covariant Stückelberg approach turns into the Lorentz gauge quantization of QED. In the Stückelberg approach Poincaré invariance is manifest, but all results have to be proven to be independent of spurious effects due to the ghosts. We have shown that it is possible to master the complications of reduced phase space quantization, the loss of manifest Poincare invariance and the nonlocality of the fields, which arise for the sake of quantizing only physical degrees of freedom. The reduced approach might be an important alternative to the covariant Stückelberg approach to massive non-Abelian gauge theories [4], where the difficulties of disentangling the spurious from the physical results may be at least comparable to the difficulties of having to prove the Poincaré invariance of the physical result. From the properties of the reduced fields found in this paper we see various interesting applications. A direct application for example might be the calculation of relativistic boundstates of fermions coupled via massive vector fields. Writing the relativistically invariant Bethe-Salpeter equation for QED into a form of a single time boundstate equation and comparing different gauges Love [11] showed that the Coulomb gauge with its instantaneous Coulomb potential gives the most effective description of relativistic boundstates of two fermions. Correspondingly we expect the choice of the nonlocal reduced fields with its instantaneous Yukawa potential to be the most effective way to describe relativistic fermions bound by massive photons. In general the description in terms of reduced fields should be the most effective one in all circumstances where the Coulomb gauge is the most effective one for QED. Another important application connected with the main aim of the present paper, namely to find a Lorentz invariant quantum theory of vector fields with a well defined massless limit, is the possibility to study the IR behaviour of the corresponding massless theory, such as the formation of Lorentz and gauge invariant condensates [12, 13]. The infrared catastrophe can be controlled by allowing the gauge field to have a small finite mass. For the simple example of massive QED, discussed in this paper, the nonlocal reduced fields coincide in the zero momentum limit with the three local vector fields, since R ij ( q = 0) = δ ij and become transverse photons in the high momentum limit. For a small finite mass we can therefore regard the nonlocal field as a smooth interpolation between the three gauge invariant zero momentum components and the two transverse components for the nonzero momentum components. After all calculations have been done with the reduced fields, the massless limit can then be taken in a smooth way. Of course in the case of QED the vacuum structure is well known to be trivial. However, as discussed in [13]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>, already in the scenario of the global colour model of QCD the transition to nonlocal fields as discussed above allows one to give an explicit construction of a squeezed condensate and the corresponding effective quark action with interesting properties. The present work could be a first step towards the investigation of more complicated theories such as QCD with a nontrivial vacuum structure.</figDesc>

				<head>A Classical Lorentz transformation properties</head>

				<p>In order to investigate the Lorentz transformation properties of the classical fields V k (x), we consider an infinitesimal boost along ǫ δx k = ǫ k t δt = ǫ i x i . (125)</p>

				<p>The partial derivatives and vectors then transform as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>δ(∂ k ) = −ǫ k ∂ t , δ(∂ t ) = −ǫ i ∂ i , (126) δV k = ǫ k V 0 , δV 0 = ǫ i V i . (127)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>From these we can derive the corresponding infinitesimal changes in the fields.</p>

				<p>The local V i have the standard transformation properties δ L V k = ǫ i (x i ∂ t + t∂ i )V k − ǫ k V 0</p>

					<trash>= ǫ i (x i ∂ t + t∂ i )V k + ǫ k 1 ∂ 2 − M 2 ∂ i ˙ V i , (128) realized nonlinearly using (9) for V 0 . The non-local V R i on the other hand transform as δ L V R k [V ]</trash>

				<p>The second term originates from the nonlocality of the physical V R k [V ] and corresponds to a gauge transformation. It is different from the second term in the transformation formula of the local V k .</p>
