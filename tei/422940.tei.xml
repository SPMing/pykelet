				<p>We develop a &quot; variational mass &quot; expansion approach, recently introduced in the Gross–Neveu model, to evaluate some of the order parameters of chiral symmetry breakdown in QCD. The method relies on a reorganization of the usual perturbation theory with the addition of an arbitrary quark mass m, whose non-perturbative behaviour is inferred partly from renormalization group properties, and from analytic continuation in m properties. The resulting ansatz can be optimized, and in the chi-ral limit m → 0 we estimate the dynamical contribution to the &quot; constituent &quot; masses of the light quarks M u,d,s ; the pion decay constant F π and the quark condensate ¯ qq.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>A still challenging question in strong interaction physics is the derivation of the lowenergy properties of the spectrum from &quot; QCD first principle &quot; , due to our limited present skill with non-perturbative physics. At very low energy, where the ordinary perturbation theory cannot be applied, Chiral Perturbation Theory [1] and Extended Nambu–Jona- Lasinio models [2, 3] 1 give a consistent framework in terms of a set of parameters that have to be fixed from the data; yet the bridge between those effective parameters and the basic QCD degrees of freedom remains largely unsolved. Although lattice QCD simulations recently made definite progress [5] in that direction, the consistent treatment of dynamical unquenched quarks and the chiral symmetry remains a serious problem.</p>

				<p>In this paper, we investigate a new, semi-analytical method, to explore how far the basic QCD Lagrangian can provide, in a self-consistent way, non-zero dynamical quark masses, quark condensates, and pion decay constant, in the limit of vanishing Lagrangian (current) quark masses. Such a qualitative picture of chiral symmetry breakdown (CSB) can be made more quantitative by applying a new &quot; variational mass &quot; approach, recently developed within the framework of the anharmonic oscillator [6], and in the Gross–Neveu (GN) model [7, 8]. The starting point is very similar to the ideas developed a long time ago and implemented in various different forms in refs.[9], [10]. There, it was advocated that the convergence of conventional perturbation theory may be improved by a variational procedure in which the separation of the action into &quot; free &quot; and &quot; interaction &quot; parts is made to depend on some set of auxiliary parameters. The results obtained by expanding to finite order in this redefined perturbation series are optimal in regions of the space of auxiliary parameters where they are least sensitive to these parameters. Recently there appeared strong evidence that this optimized perturbation theory may indeed lead to a rigorously convergent series of approximations even in strong coupling cases [11]. An essential novelty, however, in [6]–[8] and the present paper, is that our construction combines in a specific manner the renormalization group (RG) invariance with the properties of an analytically continued, arbitrary mass parameter m. This, at least in a certain approximation to be motivated, allows us to reach infinite order of the variationalperturbative expansion, and therefore presumably optimal, provided it converges. Our main results are a set of non-perturbative ansatzs for the relevant CSB quantities, as functions of the variational mass m, which can be studied for extrema and optimized. Quite essentially, our construction also provides a simple and consistent treatment of the renormalization , reconciling the variational approach with the inherent infinities of quantum field theory and the RG properties. Before proceeding, let us note that there exists a quite radically different attitude towards CSB in QCD, advocating that the responsible mechanism is most probably the non-perturbative effects due to the instanton vacuum [12], or even more directly related to confinement [13]. However, even if the instanton picture of CSB is on general grounds well motivated, and many fruitful ideas have been developed in that context 2 , as far as we are aware there is at present no sufficiently rigorous or compelling evidence for it, derived from &quot; first principle &quot; . In any event, it is certainly of interest to investigate quantitatively the &quot; non-instantonic &quot; contribution to CSB, and we hope that our method is a more consistent step in that direction.</p>

				<p>In what follows we only consider the SU(n f ) L × SU(n f ) R part of the chiral symmetry, realized by the QCD Lagrangian in the absence of quark mass terms, and for n f = 2 or n f = 3 as physically relevant applications. Following the treatment of the anharmonic oscillator [6] and its generalization to the GN model [7, 8], let us consider the following modification of the usual QCD Lagrangian,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L QCD → L f ree QCD (g 0 = 0, m 0 = 0) − m 0 n f i=1 q i q i + L int QCD (g 2 0 → xg 2 0 ) + x m 0 n f i=1 q i q i , (1) where L int</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>QCD designates the ordinary QCD interaction terms, and x is a convenient &quot; interpolating &quot; expansion parameter. This formally is equivalent to substituting everywhere in the bare</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Lagrangian, m 0 → m 0 (1 − x); g 2 0 → g 2 0 x, (2)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>and therefore in any perturbative (bare) quantity as well, calculated in terms of m 0 and g 2 0 . Since the original massless QCD Lagrangian is recovered for x → 1, m 0 is to be considered as an arbitrary mass parameter after substitution (2). One expects to optimize physical quantities with respect to m 0 at different, possibly arbitrary orders of the expansion parameter x, eventually approaching a stable limit, i.e flattest with respect to m 0 , at sufficiently high order in x.</p>

				<p>However, before accessing any physical quantity of interest for such an optimization, the theory should be renormalized, and there is an unavoidable mismatch between the expansion in x, as introduced above, and the ordinary perturbative expansion as dictated by the mass and coupling counterterms. Moreover, it is easy to see that at any finite order in the x expansion, one always recovers a trivial result in the limit m → 0 (equivalently x → 1), which is the limit in which to identify non-zero order parameters of CSB. These problems can be circumvented by advocating a specific ansatz, which resums the (reorganized) perturbation series in x and is such that the limit x → 1 no longer gives a trivial zero mass gap. As was shown in detail in ref. [8], the ansatz for the dynamical mass is most easily derived by following the steps 3 :</p>

Solving (3) imposing the &quot; fixed point &quot; boundary condition: M ≡ m(M), (4) at two-loop RG order we obtain, after some algebra (we use the normalization β(g) = −b 0 g 3 − b 1 g 5 − · · ·, γ m (g) = γ 0 g 2 + γ 1 g 4 + · · ·): M 2 = ¯ m f − γ 0 2b 0 1 + b 1 b 0 ¯ g 2 f −1 1 + b 1 b 0 ¯ g 2 − γ 1 2b 1 + γ 0 2b 0 , (5) where ¯ m ≡ m(¯ µ), ¯ g ≡ g(¯ µ) (¯ µ ≡ µ √ 4πe −γ E /2 ), and f ≡ ¯ g 2 /g 2 (M 2 ) satisfies f = 1 + 2b 0 ¯ g 2 ln M 2 ¯ µ + b 1 b 0 ¯ g 2 ln 1 + b 1 b 0 ¯ g 2 f −1 1 + b 1 b 0 ¯ g 2 f ; (6) (note in (5) and (6</trash>

				<head>In [8]</head>

				<p>it was shown that the previous steps correspond (up to a specific renormalization scheme (RS) change, allowed on general grounds from RG properties) to a resummation of the x series as generated from the substitution (2) 4 . Moreover this is in fact the only way of rendering compatible the above x expansion and the ordinary perturbative one, thus obtaining finite results. Actually the resummation coincides with the exact result in the large-N limit of the GN model. Now, since the summation can be formally extended to arbitrary RG orders [8], including consistently as many arbitrary perturbative correction terms as known in a given theory, in the QCD case we make the assumption that it gives an adequate &quot; trial ansatz &quot; , to be subsequently optimized in a way to be specified next. After appropriate rescaling of the basic parameters, ¯ g and ¯ m, by introducing the RG-invariant basic scale Λ M S [18] (at two-loop order), and the convenient scale-invariant dimensionless &quot; mass &quot; parameter</p>

					<trash>1 = (2/3)(γ 0 /2b 0 ) and M 2 = K/(2b 0 ) 2 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Observe in fact that, were we in a simplified QCD world, where there would be no non-logarithmic perturbative contributions (i.e. such that M 1 = M 2 = · · · = 0 in (10)), the latter ansatz would then resums exactly the x variational expansion.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>In that case, (10) would have a very simple behaviour near the origin m ′′ → 0. Indeed, it is easy to see that (11) admits an expansion F (y) ≃ C (B−C)/A y 1/A for y → 0, which immediately implies that (10) would give a simple pole at y → 0, with a residue giving M 2 = (2C) −C Λ M S . Moreover one can always choose an appropriate renormalization scheme in which b 2 and γ 2 are set to zero, as well as all higher order coefficients, so that there are no other corrections to the simple above relation. Now, in the realistic world, M 1 , M 2 , etc can presumably not be neglected. We can nevertheless expand (10) near m ′′ → 0 for any known non-zero M i , using</figDesc>

				<p>, (12) and the resulting Laurent expansion in (m ′′ ) 1/A may be analysed for extrema and optimized at different, in principle arbitrary (m ′′ ) 1/A orders. An important point, however, is that the perturbative corrections do depend on the RS choice, as is well known. Since the pure RG behaviour in (10) already gives the order of magnitude, M ≃ const × Λ M S , we can hope that a perturbative but optimized treatment of the remaining corrections is justifed. In other words we shall perform an &quot; optimized perturbation &quot; with respect to m ′′ around the non-trivial fixed point of the RG solution.</p>

				<p>To take into account this RS freedom, we first introduce in (10) an arbitrary scale parameter a, from ¯ µ → a ¯ µ. Accordingly the perturbative coefficients M i in (10) take a logarithmic dependence in a, simply fixed order by order from (5)–(7) and the requirement that (10) differs from the original MS expression only by higher order terms. The a-dependence will eventually exhibit a non-trivial extrema structure and we shall also optimize the result with respect to a 5 . Actually there are other possible changes of renormalization prescriptions affecting expression (10) in addition to the a dependence, which may be taken into account as well. More precisely, the second coefficient of γ m (g), γ 1 , do depend on the RS choice, even in MS schemes [20]. As it turns out, this additional RS freedom is very welcome in our case: in fact, the previous picture is invalidated, due to the occurence of extra branch cuts in the y plane at Re[y cut ] &gt; 0, as given by the zeros of dy/dF from (11) (in addition to the original cut on the negative real y axis). This prevents using the expansion near the origin, eq. (12), since it would lead to ambiguities of O(exp(Re[y]/m ′′ )) for m ′′ → 0 6 . The specific contour around the negative real axis was suggested by the known properties of the large N limit of the GN model, and it is not surprising if the analytic structure is more complicated in QCD. However, the nice point is that the actual position of those cuts do depend on the RS, via A(γ 1 ) in (11). Defining γ ′ 1 ≡ γ 1 + ∆γ 1 , we can choose Re[y cut ] ≃ 0 for ∆γ 1 ≃ 0.00437 (0.00267) for n f = 2 (n f = 3), respectively. We therefore consider [15] the general RS change</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>m ′ = ¯ m (1 + B 1 ¯ g 2 + B 2 ¯ g 4 ) ; g ′ 2 = ¯ g 2 (1 + A 1 ¯ g 2 + A 2 ¯ g 4 ) (13) (implying ∆γ 1 = 2b 0 B 1 − γ 0 A 1</trash>

					<figDesc>), and optimize with respect to this new arbitrariness 7 .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>However one soon realizes that our extension of the &quot; principle of minimal sensitivity &quot; (PMS) [9] defines a rather complicated optimization problem. Fortunately, we can study this problem within some approximations, which we believe are legitimate. Since the ansatz (10) (with the above RS change understood, to make it consistent) would indeed be optimal with respect to m ′′ for vanishing perturbative non-logarithmic corrections, M i = 0, we shall assume that the expansion for small m ′′ is as close as possible to an optimum , and define the m ′′ → 0 limit by some relatively crude but standard approximation, avoiding numerical optimization with respect to m ′′ . The approximation we are looking for is not unique: given (10), one could construct different approximations leading to a finite limit for m ′′ → 0 [8]. Here we shall only demonstrate the feasibility of our program in the simplest possible realization. In fact, since we shall anyhow optimize with respect to the RS dependence we assume that it largely takes into account this non-uniqueness due to higher order uncertainties. Padé approximants are known to greatly improve perturbative results [22] and often have the effect of smoothing the RS dependence. We thus take a simple Padé approximant which by construction restitutes a simple pole for F →</p>

				<p>We have performed a rather systematic study of the possible extrema of (14) for arbitrary a, B 1 (with ∆γ 1 fixed so that the extra cuts start at Re[y] ≃ 0). We obtain the flattest such extrema for a ≃ 2.1, B 1 ≃ 0.1, which leads to the result</p>

				<head>6</head>

				<p>The origin of those singularities is rather similar to the ambiguities related to renormalons [21]. An essential difference, however, is that the present singularities occur in the analytic continuation of a mass parameter rather than a coupling constant, and it is possible to move those singularities away by an appropriate RS change, as we discuss next. See ref. [15]</p>

				<head n="3">Composite operators and F π</head>

				<p>We shall now generalize the ansatz (10) for the pion decay constant F π . The main idea is to do perturbation theory around the same RG evolution solution with the non-trivial fixed point, as specified by the function F in (11), with perturbative correction terms obviously specific to F π . A definition of F π suiting all our purposes is [1, 24]</p>

				<p>The perturbative expansion of (16) for m = 0 is available to the three-loop order, as it can be easily extracted from the very similar contributions to the electroweak ρ-parameter, calculated at two loops in [25] and three loops in [26].</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>, are fixed by matching the perturbative MS expansion in a way to be specified next. Formula (17) necessitates some comments: apart from the obvious changes in the powers of F , y, etc, dictated by dimensional analysis, note that the perturbative expansion of the (composite operator) A µ A ν in (16) starts at one-loop, but zero g 2 order. This leads to the extra 2b 0 F factor in (17), corresponding to an expansion starting at O(1/g 2 ) 8 .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Another difference is that the perturbative expansion of (16) is ambiguous due to remaining divergences after mass and coupling constant renormalization. Accordingly it necessitates additional subtractions which, within our framework, are nothing but the usual renormalization procedure for a composite operator , which is (perturbatively) well-defined [20]. The only consequence is that, after a consistent treatment of the subtracted terms (i.e respecting RG invariance), the unambiguous determination of the 1/F n perturbative terms in (17) necessitates the knowledge of the (n + 1) order of the ordinary perturbative expansion. The nice thing, however, is that the subtracted terms only affect the values of α π and β π , but not the form of the ansatz (17), as soon as the order of the variational-perturbative expansion is larger than 1 [8]. The consistency of our formalism is checked by noting that the re-expansion of (17) do reproduce correctly the LL and NLL dependence in ¯ m of the perturbative expansion of the composite operator to all orders. The analyticity range with respect to ∆γ 1 , discussed in section 2, remains valid for (17) as well, since the branch cuts are determined by the very same relation (11). We can thus proceed to a numerical optimization with respect to the RS dependence, along the same line as the mass case in section 2. Using an appropriate Padé approximant form to define the F → 0 (m ′′ → 0) limit, we obtain the optimal values as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>F P adé π,opt (m ′′ → 0) ≃ 0.55 Λ M S (2) (0.59 Λ M S (3) ) , (18) for n f = 2 (3). With F π ≃ 92 MeV, this gives Λ M S ≃ 157 (168) MeV, for n f = 3 (2). 4 ¯ qq ansatz</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>As is well known [20, 4], ¯ qq is not RG-invariant, while m¯ qq is; this is thus the relevant quantity to consider for applying our RG-invariant construction. A straightforward generalization of the derivation in section 3 leads to the ansatz</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>¯ m¯ qq Λ 4 M S = (2b 0 ) 2 −4C a 4 2iπ dy y e y/m ′′ y 4 (F ) 4A−1 [C + F ] 4B δ ¯ qq 1 + α ¯ qq (a) F (y) (19)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where again the coefficients δ ¯ qq and α ¯ qq (1) are obtained from matching the ordinary perturbative expansion after a subtraction, and will be given explicitely elsewhere [15]. The perturbative expansion, known up to two-loop order [27, 15] implies that one only knows unambiguously the first order correction O(1/F ) in (19), as previously discussed. Apart from that, (19) has all the expected properties (RG invariance, resumming LL and NLL dependence etc), but a clear inconvenience is that ¯ qq cannot be directly accessed, being screened by tiny explicit symmetry breaking effects due to m = 0. This is of course a well-known problem, not specific to our construction. However, it is not clear how to consistently include explicit symmetry breaking effects within our framework. As amply discussed, in (19) m ′′ is an arbitrary parameter, destined to reach its chiral limit m ′′ → 0. Accordingly, ¯ m → 0 for m ′′ → 0, so that one presumably expects only to recover a trivial result, ¯ m¯ qq → 0 for m ′′ → 0. This is actually the case: although (19) potentially gives a non-trivial result in the chiral limit, namely the simple pole residue (≡ 2b 0 (2C)</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>−C δ ¯ qq α ¯ qq (a), upon neglecting unknown higher-order purely perturbative corrections), when we require extrema of this expression with respect to RS changes, using for the m ′′ → 0 limit a Padé approximant similar to the one for F π , we do not find non-zero extrema. Such a result is not conclusive regarding the actual value of ¯ qq(¯ µ), but it may be considered a consistency cross-check of our formalism. On the other hand, we should mention that our basic expression (19) does possess nontrivial extrema for some m ′′ opt = 0. These we however refrain from interpreating in a more quantitative way since, within our framework, we cannot give to m ′′ × Λ M S the meaning of a true, explicit quark mass (whose input we in principle need in order to extract a ¯ qq value from (19)). At least, it strongly indicates that it should be possible to extract ¯ qq in the chiral limit, by introducing in a consistent way a small explicit symmetry-breaking mass, −m 0,exp ¯ q i q i , to the basic Lagrangian (1).</figDesc>

				<p>In this paper we have shown that the variational expansion in arbitrary m ′′ , as developed in the context of the GN model [8], can be formally extended to the QCD case, apart from the complication due to the presence of extra singularities, which can be however removed by appropriate RS change. As a result we obtain in the chiral limit non-trivial relationships between Λ M S and the dynamical masses and order parameters, F π , ¯ m¯ qq.</p>

				<p>The resulting expressions in a generalized RS have been numerically optimized, using a well-motivated Padé approximant form, due to the complexity of the full optimization problem. The optimal values obtained for M q and F π are quite encouraging, while for ¯ qq they are quantitatively not conclusive, due to the inherent screening by an explicit mass term of this quantity, in the limit m → 0. A possible extension to include consistently explicit breaking mass terms in our formalism is explored in ref. [15].</p>
