				<p>DAMA is an observatory for rare processes and it is operative deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N. (LNGS). The main experimental set-ups are: i) DAMA/NaI (≃ 100 kg of highly radiopure NaI(Tl)), which completed its data taking on July 2002 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]; ii) DAMA/LXe (≃ 6.5 kg liquid Kr-free Xenon enriched either in 129 Xe or in 136 Xe) [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]; iii) DAMA/R&amp;D, devoted to tests on prototypes and to small scale experiments, mainly on the investigations of double beta decay modes in various isotopes [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]; iv) the new second generation DAMA/LIBRA set-up (≃ 250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl)) in operation since March 2003 [49]; v) the low background DAMA/Ge detector mainly devoted to sample measurements; in some measurements the low-background Germanium detectors of the LNGS facility are also used [50, 51]. Moreover, a third generation R&amp;D is in progress towards a possible 1 ton set-up, DAMA proposed in 1996.</p>

				<head n="2">The investigation on Dark Matter particles by annual modulation signature 2.1. The DAMA/NaI model independent result</head>

				<p>The highly radio-pure DAMA/NaI set-up [3, 7, 11, 12] has been a pioneer Dark Matter experiment of suitable exposed mass, sensitivity and stability of the running conditions , taking data at LNGS over seven annual cycles. The main aim of DAMA/NaI has been the investigation of the presence of Dark Matter (DM) particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model independent annual modulation signature, originally suggested by [52, 53] in the middle of 80&apos;s. The data taking has been completed in July 2002 and still results are produced by various kinds of studies. The final model independent result on Dark Matter particles by DAMA/NaI has been published in [11, 12], while some of the many possible corollary model dependent investigations have been published in [11, 12, 13, 14]; other corollary quests are available in literature, such as e.g. refs. [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. Moreover, many other scenarios can be considered as well and some of them are already under analysis. In addition, profiting by its low-background features and by the high collected exposure, several results have been achieved both on Dark Matter particle investigations with other approaches and on several other rare processes [1, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. We just remind that the annual modulation signature is based on the yearly Earth motion around the Sun, which is moving in the galactic halo. This motion induces a &quot; wind &quot; of Dark Matter particles on the Earth, whose intensity – measured by the experimental setup deep underground – varies along the year. This intensity should satisfy the following peculiarities: i) it varies as a cosine function; ii) with 1 year period; iii) with maximum around roughly 2 June; iv) with amplitude not exceeding 7% in many of the possible scenarios; but some scenarios exist which can expect a larger value. Moreover, the variation should be: v) present only in the low energy region where Dark Matter particles can induce the signal; vi) present only in events where energy is deposited only in one of the several scintillators of the setup since the probability of multiple interactions is negligible. The highly radiopure NaI(Tl) is particularly suitable for this kind of experiment since it is sensitive to Dark Matter particles of various natures, both of low (through Na target) and high mass (through I target) and with various type of interactions; moreover, it also offers many technical-practical advantages.</p>

				<p>In the DAMA/NaI experiment advanced techniques for low background experiments have been exploited and further developed; a continuous monitoring and control of all the running conditions was also assured. This signature, when analysing the measured counting rate in a suitable large mass low background NaI(Tl), offers the possibility to point out the presence of Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo in a model independent way.</p>

				<p>. Left: experimental residual rate for single-hit events in the cumulative (2– 6) keV energy interval as a function of the time over 7 annual cycles, end of data taking July 2002. The experimental points present the errors as vertical bars and the associated time bin width as horizontal bars. The superimposed curve represents the cosinusoidal function behaviour expected for a Dark Matter particle signal with a period equal to 1 year and phase exactly at 2 nd June; the modulation amplitude has been obtained by best fit [11, 12]. Right: experimental residual rates over seven annual cycles for single-hit events (open circles) – class of events to which DM events belong – and over the last two annual cycles for multiple-hits events (filled triangles) – class of events to which DM events do not belong – in the (2–6) keV cumulative energy interval. They have been obtained by considering for each class of events the data as collected in a single annual cycle and using in both cases the same identical hardware and the same identical software procedures. The initial time is taken on August 7 th . This latter result offers an additional strong support for the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo further excluding any side effect either from hardware, from software procedures or from background. In particular, the DAMA/NaI set-up has pointed out the presence of an annual modulation in the single-hit residual rate in the lowest energy interval (2 – 6) keV (see Fig. 1</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>); the observed effect satisfies the many peculiarities of the DM particle induced signature. This gives a 6.3 σ C.L. evidence over seven annual cycles (total exposure: 107731 kg × day) for the presence of DM particles in our Galaxy (see refs. [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>; moreover, further works on the corollary model dependent investigations are in progress). Neither systematic effects nor side reactions able to account for the measured modulation amplitude and to contemporaneously Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay satisfy all the peculiarities of the signature have been found or suggested by anyone. This result is model-independent. It represents the first experimental evidence of the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo independently on their composition and nature. At present, apart from DAMA/LIBRA, no other experiment is sensitive, for mass, radiopurity and control of the stability, to such a model independent signature and, in particular, no other activity is available whose result can directly be compared in a model independent way with the one of DAMA/NaI.</p>

				<head n="2.2">Some of the possible corollary quests for the DM candidate particles</head>

				<p>Several corollary investigations have been pursued on the nature of the DM candidate particles and on the astrophysical scenarios. These corollary investigations are instead model-dependent and, due to the poor knowledge on the astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics needed assumptions and on the related parameters, they have no general meaning as it is also the case of exclusion plots and of DM particle parameters evaluated in indirect detection experiments. Thus, these investigations should be handled in the most general way (see for discussions at some extent e.g. [11, 12, 13, 14] and in literature; other works are in progress).</p>

				<p>Several (of the many possible) corollary quests for a candidate particle have been carried out on the class of DM candidate particles named WIMPs [11, 12]. Low and high WIMP mass candidates interacting with ordinary matter via the general case of mixed SI&amp;SD coupling and the subcases of dominant SI coupling or of dominant SD coupling has been considered as well as the case of WIMPs with preferred SI inelastic scattering [11, 12]. In fact, the general solution for WIMPs is a 4-dimensional allowed volume in the space (ξσ SI ,ξσ SD ,θ,m W ) in the first case (being the two subcases given by slices of this volume) and a 3-dimensional allowed volume in the space (ξσ p ,δ,m W ) for the last one [11, 12]. There, ξ is the fractional amount of local density of DM particles, σ SI and σ SD are the point-like SI and SD DM particle-nucleon cross sections and tgθ is the ratio between the effective SD coupling strengths of the DM particle with neutron and proton (θ is defined in the [0,π) interval), σ p is the cross section for WIMPs with preferred inelastic interactions and δ is the mass splitting of the two mass states of this candidate.</p>

				<p>Accounting at some extent for the present poor knowledge of all the astrophysical, nuclear and particle Physics aspects the results have been given in terms of external contour obtained by the superposition of the allowed volumes/regions, that is they account for a large number of sets of best fit values. In particular, for the case of WIMP elastically scattering on nuclei the obtained best-fit mass ranges from GeV to about 1 TeV and the cross section spans over more than one order of magnitude when accounting at least at some extent for some of the present uncertainties on assumptions and parameters. For some details and results see refs. [11, 12]. Furthermore, Galaxy hierarchical formation theories [61], numerical simulations [62], the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG) in 1994 [63] and more recent investigations [64]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>suggest that the dark halo of the Milky Way can have a rich phenomenology containing non thermalized dark matter fluxes. Thus, recently the contribution of the SagDEG has been investigated by analyzing the consequences of its DM stream contribution to the galactic halo on the DAMA/NaI annual modulation data. For simplicity,</figDesc>

				<p>5 in this analysis we have investigated these topics just considering some of the candidates belonging to the WIMP class and few of the many possible astrophysical, nuclear and particle Physics scenarios as already considered in refs. [11, 12] in order to allow a direct comparison. Some examples are given in Fig. 2, while results on further aspects and details can be found in ref. [14]</p>

				<p>. Left: filled areas are examples of slices, in the plane ξσ SI vs ξσ SD , of the 4-dimensional allowed volume for DM particle with mixed SI&amp;SD interaction for the model frameworks given in [11, 12]. Right: filled area is the region allowed in the (ξσ SI , m W ) plane in the scenarios for pure SI coupling considered in [11, 12]. The areas enclosed by the lines are obtained by introducing the SagDEG contribution [14]. In all the cases inclusion of other existing uncertainties on parameters and models would further extend the regions and increase the sets of best fit values. Other streams can potentially play more intriguing roles in the corollary investigations for whatever candidate particle with whatever approach and for comparisons; they will be investigated in near future, such as e.g. the Canis Major [64] and those arising from caustic halo models [65].</p>

				<p>The DAMA/NaI allowed volumes/regions are well compatible with theoretical expectations for neutralino in various scenarios (see as an example [56]). It is worth to remind that the neutralino itself has both SI and SD coupling and that the basic theory has a very large number of &quot; open &quot; parameters. Also several other WIMP candidates fit the DAMA/NaI model independent evidence as well as other existing candidates with a phenomenology similar, but not identical as for the WIMP cases e.g.: the mirror Dark Matter particles [59], the self-interacting dark matter particles [60], etc. etc. Moreover, several candidates not belonging to the WIMP class and having different interaction features, to which DAMA/NaI – on the contrary of others – is fully sensitive, are also available. In addition, in principle whatever particle with suitable characteristics, even not yet foreseen by theories, can be a good candidate as DM in the galactic halo.</p>

				<p>As a relevant case, the DAMA/NaI annual modulation data have also been analysed</p>

				<head>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</head>

				<p>in terms of a light (≃ keV mass) bosonic candidate, either with pseudoscalar or with scalar axion-like coupling; details are available in ref. [13]. For these candidates, the Figure 3. DAMA/NaI allowed region at 3σ C.L. in the plane g aγγ vs m a for a light pseudoscalar candidate (crossed hatched region). All the configurations in this region can be allowed depending on the values of all the g a ¯ ff . Examples of two of the many possible models: i) upper black region: coupling only to electrons; ii) lower black region: coupling (proportional to the m a ) through the (weak) isospin to quarks and leptons. For details see ref. [13]. The indicative region of the Kaluza-Klein (K.K.) pseudoscalar axion credited in ref. [66] from the analysis of indirect observations and the region of the DFSZ and KSVZ models (P.Q. axion) are shown as well. The solid line corresponds to a particle with lifetime equal to the age of the Universe; at least all the g aγγ &apos;s below this line are of cosmological interest. However, in principle, it might be possible that the configurations above this line would also become of interest in case of some exotic mechanism of the a particle production. Thus, a pseudoscalar DM candidate can also account for the DAMA/NaI model independent result as well as the WIMP solutions already discussed elsewhere. direct detection process is based on the total conversion in NaI(Tl) crystal of the mass of the absorbed bosonic particle into electromagnetic radiation. Thus, in these processes the target nuclei recoil is negligible and is not involved in the detection process. Thus, signals from these light bosonic DM candidates are detected in DAMA/NaI, but are lost in activities based on the selection/rejection procedures of the electromagnetic contribution to their counting rate (such as e.g. Cdms, Edelweiss, Cresst, Warp, etc.) [13]. Despite these particles are unstable, their lifetime can be of cosmological interest and offers valuable candidates for the DM signal, observed in DAMA/NaI. In particular , the result for the pseudoscalar case for the same astrophysical scenarios of ref. [11, 12] is shown in Fig. 3.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Obviously, the discussed corollary quests are not at all exhaustive of the many scenarios open at present level of knowledge for these and for other classes of candidates as well as for the astrophysical and nuclear/atomic aspects. Several other investigations have been discussed in literature and other studies are in progress.</figDesc>

				<p>No</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>experiment is available – with the exception of the presently running DAMA/LIBRA – whose result can be directly compared in a model independent way with the experimental positive 6.3 σ C.L. evidence for the presence of particle Dark Matter in the galactic halo obtained by DAMA/NaI. Thus, claims for contradictions have intrinsically no scientific meaning. In particular, as regards some claimed model-dependent comparisons presented so far we just mention – among the many existing arguments – that: i) the other experiments are insensitive to the annual modulation signature; ii) they release just a marginal exposure (orders of magnitude lower than the one by DAMA/NaI) after several/many years underground; iii) they exploit strong data selection and strong and often unsafe rejection techniques of their huge counting rate, becoming at the same time insensitive to several DM candidates; iv) they generally quote in an incorrect/partial/not updated way the DAMA/NaI result; v) they consider a single model fixing all the astrophysical, nuclear and particle Physics assumptions as well as all the theoretical and experimental parameters at a single questionable choice 2 . Thus, e.g. for the WIMP case they do not account for the existing uncertainties on the real coupling with ordinary matter, on the spin-dependent and spin-independent form factors and related parameters for each nucleus, on the spin factor used for each nucleus, on the real scaling laws for nuclear cross sections among different target materials; on the experimental and theoretical parameters, on the effect of different halo models and related parameters on the different target materials, etc. For example, large differences are expected in the counting rate among nuclei fully sensitive to the SD interaction (as 23 Na and 127 I) with the respect to nuclei largely insensitive to such a coupling (as e.g</figDesc>
					<trash>nat Ge, nat Si, nat Ar, nat Ca, nat W,</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>nat O) and also when nuclei in principle all sensitive to this coupling but having different unpaired nucleon (e.g. neutron in case of the odd spin nuclei, such as</figDesc>
					<trash>129 Xe, 131 Xe, 125 Te, 73 Ge, 29 Si, 183 W and proton in the 23 Na and 127 I). Moreover, in</trash>

				<p>contribution in WIMP detection arising e.g. from known effect induced by recoiling nuclei), all the experiments, such as e.g. Cdms, Edelweiss, Cresst, Zeplin, Warp and their extensions, do lose the signal in their rejection procedures of the e.m. contribution to the counting rate. In addition, those experiments present many critical points e.g. both regarding the energy scale and the multiple selection procedures (related stabilities and efficiencies, systematics in the claimed rejection factors, ranging from 10 −4 to 10 −8 , evaluations, stabilities and monitoring of the spill-out factors, ...) on which their claimed sensitivities (in a &quot; single &quot; set of assumptions and parameters&apos; values) are based. For completeness, it is also worth to note that no results obtained with different target material can intrinsically be directly compared even for the same kind of coupling , although apparently all the presentations generally refer to cross section on the nucleon. In fact, this requires – among others – the knowledge of e.g. the real scaling laws, form factors, etc.; the situation is much worse than that in the field of double beta decay experiments when different isotopes are used. Discussions at some extent are also reported e.g. in ref. [11, 12, 13, 14]; all those general comments also hold in the substance for more recent data releases. As regards the indirect searches, a comparison would always require the calculation and the consideration of all the possible DM particle configurations in the given particle model, since it does not exist a biunivocal correspondence between the observables in the two kinds of experiments. However, the present positive hints provided by indirect searches are not in conflict with the DAMA/NaI result. Finally, it is worth to note that – among the many corollary aspects still open – there is f.i. the possibility that the particle dark halo can have more than one component. The more sensitive NaI(Tl) experiments in progress and in preparation by DAMA will also have this aspect among the arguments to be further investigated.</p>

				<head n="2.4">The new DAMA/LIBRA and beyond</head>

				<p>In 1996 DAMA proposed to realize a ton set-up and a new R&amp;D project for highly radiopure NaI(Tl) detectors was funded. As a consequence of the results of this second generation R&amp;D, the new experimental set-up DAMA/LIBRA (Large sodium Iodide Bulk for RAre processes), ≃250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl) crystal scintillators (matrix of twenty-five ≃ 9.70 kg NaI(Tl) crystals), was funded and realised. This set-up has replaced the previous DAMA/NaI; the experimental site as well as many components of the installation itself have been implemented (environment, shield of the photomultipliers, wiring, High-Purity Nitrogen system, cooling water of air conditioner , electronics and data acquisition system, etc.). In particular, all the Copper parts have been chemically etched before their installation following a new devoted protocol and all the procedures performed during the dismounting of DAMA/NaI and the installation of DAMA/LIBRA detectors have been carried out in High-Purity Nitrogen atmosphere [49]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>. DAMA/LIBRA is continuously taking data since March 2003; for example, in March 2007, an exposure of about 1.5 × 10 5 kg × day has already been collected. As in the case of the DAMA/NaI experiment regular routine calibrations are performed, e.g. in 4 years of measurements about 4 × 10 7 events of sources for energy calibration and 2 × 10 6 events/keV for the evaluation of the acceptance window efficiency have been acquired.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>A large work is going to be faced by the new DAMA/LIBRA, which will also further investigate with higher sensitivity several other rare processes. The first data release is foreseen not later than 2008. A third generation R&amp;D effort towards a possible NaI(Tl) ton set-up, we proposed in 1996, has been funded by I.N.F.N. and related works on selection of materials for detectors and photomultipliers are in progress [68]</p>

				<head n="3">The searches for double beta decay modes</head>

				<p>The various low background set-ups, realized by the DAMA collaboration, also allow to investigate several kinds of rare processes. In particular, several double beta decay modes have been investigated by using either the active or the passive source technique or – sometimes – the coincidence technique. Fig. 4 summarizes the many results obtained by DAMA in these searches [37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. Figure 4. Summary of the T 1/2 limits obtained by DAMA (red bars) and by previous experiments (blue bars) on various double beta decay processes All limits are at 90% C.L. except the 2β + 0ν of 136 Ce and 2β + 0ν of 142 Ce that are at 68% C.L..</p>

				<p>In particular, for this purpose the DAMA/LXe set-up [37, 38] and the DAMA/R&amp;D set-up [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] have been used, as well as the low-background Ge in the LNGS facility [50, 51]. Among the obtained results, we remind the search for: i) ββ decay modes in 136 Xe and in 134 Xe [37, 38]; ii) ββ decay modes in 136 Ce and in 142 Ce [42]; iii) 2EC2ν decay mode in 40 Ca [43]; iv) ββ decay modes in 46 Ca and in 40 Ca [44]; v) ββ decay modes in 106 Cd [45]; vi) ββ and β decay modes in 48 Ca [46];</p>

				</figure>

				<p>; viii) 2β + 0ν and ECβ + 0ν decay modes in 130 Ba [48]. Moreover, the data taken with a low background CdWO 4 scintillator are under analysis and a data taking with a ZnWO 4 detector is in progress.</p>

				<p>Presently, a molybdenum sample of 1 kg mass, enriched in the 100 Mo isotope at 99.5%, is in measurement in the low-background set-up with 4 HPGe detectors of the LNGS facility; this experiment [50] will test previous reports on observation of 2β2ν decay of 100 Mo to the first excited 0 + 1 level of 100 Ru. New data taking are foreseen also e.g. with a new larger BaF 2 scintillator and with Cadmium enriched in 106 Cd.</p>

				<p>In particular, by using the DAMA/LXe set-up filled with Kr-free Xenon gas containing 17.1% of 134 Xe and 68.8% of 136 Xe double beta decay modes in 134 Xe and 136 Xe have been investigated [37, 38]; the measurements have been carried out over 8823.54 h. A joint analysis of the 0νββ decay mode in 134 Xe and in 136 Xe (as suggested in ref. [69]) has also been carried out. The obtained new lower limits for the</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>0νββ(0 + → 0 + ) decay mode in 134 Xe and in 136 Xe (90% C.L.) are T 1/2 = 5.8 · 10 22 y and T 1/2 = 1.2 · 10 24</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>y, respectively. They correspond to a limit value on effective light Majorana neutrino mass ranging from 1.1 eV to 2.9 eV (90% C.L.), depending on the adopted theoretical model. For the neutrinoless double beta decay with Majoron (M ) in the 136 Xe isotope the obtained limit is T 1/2 = 5.0 · 10 23 y (90% C.L.) and for the 2νββ(0 + → 0 + ) and the 2νββ(0 + → 2 + ) decay modes in 136 Xe the limits at 90% C.L. are 1.0 · 10 22 y and 9.4 · 10 21 y, respectively. The experimental limit on the 2νββ(0 + → 0 + ) decay mode is in the range of the theoretical estimate by [70] (2.11 · 10 22 y) and about a factor 5 higher than that of ref. [71]; on the other hand, similar theoretical estimates suffer of the large uncertainties typically associated to the calculations of the nuclear matrix elements and the overcoming of these theoretical estimates has also been confirmed by the Baksan Xenon experiment [72].</p>

				<p>Among the other results we want to point out here just our efforts in preliminary studies on β + β + /ECβ + /ECEC decay modes since potentially they can offer both a large number of relatively poorly explored double beta decaying isotopes and the possibility of a good signature for the processes. In particular, neutrinoless double positron (0ν2β + ) decay, β + /EC decay and EC/EC decay can give, in principle, the same information as 0ν2β − decay. In addition, they can play a key role in recognising the main production mechanism, strongly depending their calculated half-lives on whether the decay is dominated by Majorana neutrino mass or by right-handed admixtures in weak interactions [5]. On the other hand, even the non-observation of the 0ν2β + decay would provide very useful additional and complementary information. The current level of experimental sensitivity is modest compared with those already achieved in the 2β − decay searches, although the present theoretical expectations for the half-lives of some 2β + candidate isotopes are favourable. To reach a suitable sensitivity the use of enriched samples is needed to effectively exploit the potentiality of the 2β + processes, which have the advantage of a very clear signature. In fact, e.g., in the 0νβ + /EC decay the monoenergetic positron will give two 511 keV annihilation γ-rays in addition to characteristic X-rays.</p>

				<p>A first step in this direction was done in ref. [45] where we present the results of a study on the 2β + decay processes in 106 Cd, which is a one of the best candidate nuclides because of its rather high Q value (2β + ), (2771 ± 8) keV and to the favourable theoretical estimates for half-lives. In this experiment, samples of metallic cadmium enriched in 106 Cd at ≃ 68% (total mass ≃ 154 g) were placed between two low background NaI(Tl) crystals in the DAMA/R&amp;D set-up; measurements were performed during 4321 h. New improved limits on the halflives of the various decay modes have been obtained [45]; they were in the range (0.3 – 4) 10 20 y (90% C.L.), that is, they were significantly higher (by factor 6 to 60) than those previously published for the same nuclide, approaching the theoretical estimates. In particular, the calculated T 1/2 values for the 2νβ + /EC decay of 106 Cd are within (8 − 40)10 20 y, which are not so far from our limit for this process. These results have strongly supported the interest in pursuing a further enhancement of the experimental sensitivity by additional purification of the enriched cadmium samples and the growth from them of a 106 CdWO 4 scintillator, which could be used as source-detector and, in combination with low background NaI(Tl) crystals, could allow to identify signals. At present some work is in progress in this direction.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Among the other efforts, we remind the results on the neutrinoless double electron capture of 40 Ca by using low background CaF 2 (Eu) scintillators in the R&amp;D set-up. The obtained new and highly improved T 1/2 limit: 3.0 × 10 21 y, has demonstrated the feasibility and perspectives of developed CaF 2 (Eu) scintillators for high sensitive investigations of the double beta decay modes.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>On the same line, BaF 2 [48] and CeF 3 [47]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>scintillators have been used in preliminary investigations both on the level of their residual radiopurity and on the possibility of investigation of some double beta decay modes in 130 Ba and of double electron capture processes in 136 Ce and in 138 Ce.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>The potentiality of the coincidence technique to search for double beta decay processes in 130 Ba has been studied by using a BaF 2 detector and two low background NaI(Tl) in the DAMA/R&amp;D set-up. The performances of the detector have preliminarily been investigated. Then, as a result, new limits (90% CL) on the lifetimes of the following double beta decay processes in</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>130 Ba have been determined: τ 2β + 0ν(0 + →0 + ) &gt; 1.1 × 10 17 y, τ 2β + 0ν(0 + →2 + 1 ) &gt; 1.5 × 10 17 y, τ ECβ + 0ν(0 + →0 + ) &gt; 2.0 × 10 17 y, τ ECβ + 0ν(0 + →2 + 1 ) &gt; 1.6 × 10 17 y, τ ECβ + 0ν(0 + →2 + 2 ) &gt; 2.0 × 10 17 y and τ ECβ + 0ν(0 + →4 + ) &gt; 1.1 × 10 17 y.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The new experimental limits obtained for the 0ν(0 + → 0 + ) decay modes represent a signicant improvement with respect to those previously available for this isotope, while those involving excited levels have been set for the first time. Measurements with a new BaF 2 detector already at hand are foreseen.</p>

				<p>As regards CeF 3 , because of the still relatively important residual radioactive contamination , the obtained limits [47] are: T</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>2ν2K 1/2 ( 136 Ce) ≥ 2.7(4.5) × 10 16 y and T 2ν2K 1/2 ( 138 Ce) ≥ 3.7(6.1) × 10 16</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>y respectively, at 90%(68%) C.L. This work has shown that signicant improvements in the sensitivity to rare processes in Ce isotopes can be obtained by exploiting the investigated techniques, but also that it is a crucial point in the achievement of more competitive results to overcome the limitation arising from the residual radioactive impurities in this kind of detector. Purication of scintillators from actinides and their daughters to the level of few µBq/kg could decrease the background at least to few counts/(day keV kg). This together with the use of isotopical enrichment in the production of CeF 3 scintillators would improve the experimental sensitivity at the level expected from the theoretical predictions.</p>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> We note that the naive and partial &quot; prescription &quot; of ref. [67] on some aspects for a single particular WIMP case cannot be defined – on the contrary of what appears in some paper – as a &quot; standard theoretical model &quot; . Such a paper summarized a single oversimplified approach adopted at that time. Its use as &quot; unique &quot; reference is obviously incorrect, since it did not account at all for the level of knowledge on all the involved astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics aspects and parameters, for the many possibilities open on the astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics aspects and for the different existing approaches as e.g. the annual modulation signature. It is also worth to note that – in addition – the figure they usually reported for comparison is not only for the reasons, discussed here and elsewhere, in the substance meaningless, but it is intrisencally wrong also because e.g.: while they do not consider the model dependent LEP limit in their exclusion plots, they do not remove it from their &quot; choice &quot; of DAMA/NaI allowed space. If done, this will show – as known since time (see literature) – that even under their single arbitrary and naive scenario (which in addition cannot be applied at all to the annual modulation data which requires – among others – time/energy correlation analysis), they are not discriminative at all.</note>
