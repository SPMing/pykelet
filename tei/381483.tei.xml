				<head>Introduction</head>

				<p>This paper is a continuation of ref. 1] where I have developed a method to obtain strong coupling expansions for scattering quantities in hamiltonian lattice eld theories. The keystone of the formalism is the derivation of an eeective quantum mechanical system using Bloch&apos;s perturbation theory 2]. This system determines the two-particle dynamics of the theory by means of a free hamiltonian and an interaction potential.</p>

				<p>Thereby the problem of scattering in lattice eld theories is reduced to a quantum mechanical problem of scattering at a potential and can be solved using the powerful methods of ordinary quantum mechanics.</p>

				<p>In order to improve our understanding of the low-energy regime of elementary particle physics several authors have studied collision phenomena in lattice eld theories in recent years 3] { 12]. It is the intent of my approach to supplement these investigations by a discussion within the framework of strong coupling perturbation theory. In 1] the (d+1) dimensional Ising model was chosen as a test case. The objective here is to investigate the collision of glueballs in non-abelian gauge theories. These models are described by the famous Kogut-Susskind hamiltonian 13], and a strong coupling perturbative analysis was rst carried out by Kogut, Sinclair and Susskind in their pioneering work on the SU(3) glueball spectrum 14]. It is characteristic for Yang-Mills theories that the spectrum is rather extensive (to get an idea of the variety of Wilson loops the reader is referred to ref. 15]).</p>

				<p>In the static limit the excitations are highly degenerate. In particular, one nds a number of single-particle states that have the same static energy as two-glueball conngurations. When the next-to-nearest neighbour interaction is turned on, this sector is deformed into a two-channel system describing two identical particles coupled to an additional channel of one-particle states.</p>

				<p>The reduced hamiltonian is a 2 2 matrix in the space of the two channels.</p>

				<p>As far as the strong coupling analysis of glueball scattering is concerned this observation adds a new aspect compared to the Ising model. In the present paper I will demonstrate to what extent the methods developed with the Ising model must be broadened to be applied to an investigation of non-abelian gauge theories. It will be argued that the eeect of the coupling to the single-particle channel can be taken into account by an additional potential in the two-glueball channel. Since there are a lot more diierent Wilson loops in three than in two spatial dimensions I decided to discuss the conceptual ideas with the SU(2) gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions.</p>

				<p>The present paper is not self-contained in the sense that the reader is referred to 1] from time to time.</p>

				<p>In section 1 the model is introduced. I discuss the static limit and analyse the dynamics of the lightest glueball up to second order in the hopping parameter .</p>

				<p>Scattering between the lightest glueballs is supposed to take place in the sector of eight-link excitations. Here one distinguishes between the connected Wilson loops and the disconnected conngurations. The former are interpreted as single-glueball states whereas the latter represent two distant light particles. Section 2 is the heart of this work. By an iteration of Bloch&apos;s method I show that the eightlink sector decomposes into a number of bound states and an eeective two-channel system where the light glueballs are coupled to three heavy particles. As far as the two-glueball channel is concerned an eeective Lippmann-Schwinger equation is derived and a series representation for the scattering solutions can be found. The leading order approximation for the scattering amplitude is calculated explicitly.</p>

				<p>In section 3 the analysis is completed by the computation of the phase shifts for the different symmetry sectors. The techniques developed with the Ising model require only a slight modiication. A resonance is detected in the collision of the light glueballs and discussed in some detail. I end with some concluding remarks and an outlook. In order to make the paper more readable I have collected some supplementary material as well as a few merely technical items in three appendices. 1 SU(2) gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions</p>

				<head n="1.1">Preliminaries</head>

				<p>We consider the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a rectangular lattice = fx j x 2 ZZ 2 ; L=2 &lt; x k L=2; k = 1; 2g (1.1) with linear extent L and lattice spacing a = 1. The directed links between neighbouring sites are labeled by a site x and a spatial index k such that the sites x + ^ k and x locate the beginning and the end of the link (x; k). By deenition, (x; k) and (x + ^ k; k) denote diierent links although they occupy the same lattice bond. A classical SU(2) lattice gauge eld is an assignment of a link variable U(x; k) 2 SU(2) to any bond (x; k) of the lattice such that</p>

				<p><formula>U(x; k) 1 = U(x + ^ k; k) : (1.2)</formula></p>

				<p>On a nite lattice one has to specify boundary conditions. For deeniteness we choose them to</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>be periodic, hence U(x; k) = U(x + L ^ l; k) ; l = 1; 2 : (1.3) In the quantum theory the classical eld U(x; k) becomes an operator eld U(x; k) acting</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>on some Hilbert space H 0 of states. At each link (x; k) of the lattice we associate a copy of L 2 (SU(2)), the space of square integrable functions on the group manifold (cf. appendix A), and call it L 2 (x; k). For a nite lattice the Hilbert space H 0 is deened as the tensor product of all L 2 (x; k). In this Schrr odinger picture the states are complex wave functions fU] that depend on the basic eld variables, i.e. the argument runs over all (periodic) gauge elds U(x; k) on .</p>

				<p>The group of (periodic) gauge transformations g(x) on acts on the wave functions through fU] ! fU g ] ;</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In appendix A we introduce the Casimir operator E 2 of the gauge group SU(2). By E 2 (x; k) we denote a copy of E 2 which acts on L 2 (x; k) as E 2 and as the identity operator on the other components of the tensor product. Now we are prepared to write down the pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory hamiltonian which was rst derived by</p>

				<p>and the so-called hopping parameter = 2=g 4 . In addition there is the discretized version of Gauss&apos; law with zero external charge. By this constraint the physical Hilbert space is identiied with the subspace of H 0 that only contains the gauge invariant wave functions. We denote the physical Hilbert space by H.</p>

				<p>Let us have a closer look at the structure of the Kogut-Susskind hamiltonian. The rst part of (1.7) is a sum over local operators that act non-trivially on one component of the tensor</p>

				<p>couples the links of the plaquettes and provides a kinetic operator. So we are back with the situation of the Ising model and ready for a perturbative investigation in the hopping parameter . For convenience we introduce IH = (2=g 2 ) IH 0 = IH 0 + I H 1 : (1.11)</p>

			<div>
				<head n="1.2">The static limit</head>

				<p>The static hamiltonian is a sum of single-link Casimir operators. From the analysis in appendix A we conclude that the eigenfunctions of IH 0 are products of representation functions of the gauge group SU(2). Clearly speaking, for each link (x; k) on the lattice one chooses a quantum number n that denotes the dimension of the irreducible representation and indices a; b = 1; : : : n. Then one forms the product of the associated representation functions U n ab (x; k). The eigenvalue of this static eigenfunction is the sum of the corresponding one-link eigenvalues (1=4)(n 2 1).</p>

				<p>The ground state of IH 0 is obtained if we set n = 1 for all links, i.e. we choose the trivial representation at each link. The corresponding wave function fU] = 1 is gauge invariant, so we are led to interpret this state as the static, physical vacuum and denote it by ji 0 : IH 0 ji 0 = 0 ; 0 h j i 0 = 1 :</p>

				<p><formula>(1.12)</formula></p>

				<p>The low-lying eigenstates of IH 0 have few excited links. Let the operator corresponding to the representation function U n ab (x; k) be denoted by a Roman letter U n ab (x; k). Then the static state with one excited link (x; k) is deened as jx; k; n; abi 0 = N U n ab (x; k)ji 0 :</p>

				<p><formula>(1.13) jx; (5; a 5 )i 0 (2) x r r r r r r jx; k; 7i 0 (2) x r r r r r r jx; (3; a 3 )i 0 (2) x r r r r r r r r jx; (4; a 4 )i 0 (2) x r r r r r r jx; (1; a 1 )i 0 (1) x r r r r r r r r jx; (2; a 2 )i 0 (4) x r r r r r r r r jxi 0 x r r r r jx; 1i 0 x r r r r r r jx; 2i 0 x r r r r r r Figure 1</formula></p>

				<p>.1: Static one-particle excitations.</p>

				<p>To determine the value of the normalizing constant N we have to calculate 0 hx; k; n; ab j x; k; n; abi 0 = N 2 0 h j U n ab (x; k) y U n ab (x; k) j i 0 :</p>

				<p><formula>(1.14)</formula></p>

				<p>The method to evaluate such matrix elements relies on the Clebsch-Gordon series for the product of representation functions and is described in detail in appendix A. Here we obtain N = p n. From the deenition (1.13) it follows IH 0 jx; k; n; abi 0 = (1=4)(n 2 1)jx; k; n; abi 0 ; (1.15) i.e. for each link with quantum number n &gt; 1 the colour electric energy is increased by the amount (1=4)(n 2 1). We say that a colour electric ux has been created, and the quantum number n is a measure for the strength of this ux. Within this picture the requirement of gauge invariance for the physical states simply means that the colour electric ux out of any site of the lattice is zero. Therefore we have to form appropriate products of the non gauge invariant states (1.13) to generate the physical spectrum of the static hamiltonian IH 0 . For instance, a gauge invariant excitation is built by taking the trace of n = 2 ux elements around one single plaquette jxi 0 def = P(x)ji 0 ;</p>

				<p>are interpreted as the lightest static glueballs. Since the trace of SU(2) matrices is real the ux along the plaquette does not have an orientation. The diierent one-particle states are distinguished by the vector x indicating the position of the plaquette on the lattice. Heavier glueballs of mass E (0) 6 = 6(3=4) = 9=2 are created from the vacuum by six-link loop operators in the same way as the four-link states (1.16). It is most suggestive and convenient to deene them pictorially as in g. 1.1. The two states jx; 1i 0 and jx; 2i 0 have the same geometrical shape and are transformed into each other by lattice rotations 2 O(2; ZZ).</p>

				<p>The next glueballs in the static spectrum are the loops of length eight with energy E (0) 8 = 6. There exist ve geometrically distinct classes which are invariant under lattice rotations. We adopt the notation jx; (k; a k )i 0 ; (1.18) where k = 1; : : :; 5 indicates the class and a k distinguishes between the diierent states of the same shape. In g. 1.1 we depict the ve prototypes. The number in brackets denotes the dimensionality of the class. Since the colour electric energy of the eight-link glueballs is just twice the energy of the four-link states the static eigenspace of energy 6 also contains two-particle excitations jx 1 ; x 2 i 0 = P(x 1 )P(x 2 )ji 0 ; jx 1 x 2 j &gt; 1 :</p>

				<p><formula>(1.19)</formula></p>

				<p>The above restriction is necessary to avoid that the two excited plaquettes overlap on one or more links. In case they do products of representation functions occur which have to be reduced by means of the Clebsch-Gordon series. The resulting states will be closed loops which carry diierent ux on the (former) common links and represent single-glueball conngurations belonging to other static eigenspaces. Since the plaquette operators at diierent sites commute it follows</p>

				<p>Above the two-particle threshold there are seven-link excitations jx; k; 7i 0 whose prototype is depicted in g. 1.1. Such conngurations are created by acting with neighbouring plaquette operators P(x) and P(x + ^ k) on the vacuum and taking the n = 3 representation on the common link, as indicated by the dashed line. The static colour electric energy is E</p>

				<p>This overview illustrates the richness of the (static) spectrum of lattice Yang-Mills theories already in two spatial dimensions. If we go to higher energies we will encounter excited glueball states (n &gt; 2), multi-particle conngurations and rather long n = 2 ux loops. It is the aim of the present work to investigate the elastic scattering between the lightest glueballs (1.16) by means of a perturbative expansion up to second order in the hopping parameter . As a prerequisite one has to analyse the one-particle dynamics of these excitations. Thereby I repeat the strong coupling technique for gauge theories as described in ref. 14].</p>

				<head n="1.3">Vacuum sector</head>

				<p>Since the physical quantities are only deened relative to the ground state of the theory we rst have to calculate order by order in the shift of the static vacuum when the colour magnetic perturbation (1.10) is turned on. From the general formula (2.14) in 1] we obtain the reduced hamiltonian for the vacuum sector</p>

				<p>As for the Ising model we introduce a pictorial description of the processes in strong coupling perturbation theory. In g. 1.2 the prototype of the non-vanishing matrix elements contributing to the reduced hamiltonian (1.22) in second order is visualized by going from the left to the right.

					<figDesc>(1.25) From the general Clebsch-Gordon series (A.21) we know that 22 = 13, i.e. the product of two fundamental representations does not contain the fundamental representation itself. Therefore the action of the plaquette operator on a four-link state leads out of the static subspace E 4 . As for the vacuum sector there is no rst order contribution to the reduced hamiltonian. To second order in perturbation theory one encounters ve diierent types of transitions. The corresponding graphs are collected in g. 1.3. Column (a) represents the process where the initial state remains undisturbed while a vacuum uctuation occurs on a distant square. The value of each such matrix element is equal to the vacuum process depicted in g. 1.2, but the counting factor is reduced by the number of plaquettes that have one link in common with the initial state. In g. 1.3 (b) the complementary graph is shown where the vacuum uctuation now has one link in common with the initial state.</figDesc>

				<p>. 2 : Single - glueball conngurations of static energy 6 .</p>

				<p>To summarize , we are concerned with a two - channel system that describes two identical particles coupled to an additional channel containing 13 single excitations . The hamiltonian H 0 sc is the operator of the kinetic energy of the two particles possibly supplemented by an interaction potential . In the single - particle channel the hamiltonian M 0 is just a mass operator . Finally the operator V 0 cc provides the coupling between the two channels .</p>

				<head n="2">. The reduced hamiltonian</head>

				<p>This section is devoted to the deduction of the reduced hamiltonian ( 2 . 10 ) . We start with the two - particle channel . The rst order contributions to H 0 sc come from processes where the action of the plaquette operator P ( x ) on a two - glueball initial state leads to a two - glueball nal state . From our considerations in section 1 we know that such a transition is not possible .</p>

				<p>To second order the perturbation acts on either of the two glueballs as described by the graphs in g . 1 . 3 , whereas the other four - link loop remains undisturbed . The only thing we have to take care of is the Bose symmetry of the two - particle conngurations . This is guaranteed by a four times larger counting factor for the graphs corresponding to g .</p>

				<p>sc is deened on the subspace of two - glueball conngurations with a relative distance larger than 2 we have to subtract those contributions to the sum over jrj &gt; 2 that lead out of H 0 sc .</p>

				<p>This is the origin of the additional terms in ( 2 . 15 ) . Next we turn to the mass operator ( 2 . 12 ) in the single - particle channel . Unlike for the two - particle channel rst order transitions exist and are shown in g . 2 . 3 . The plaquette operator creates a four - link excitation on the lower left square having two links in common with the initial state j2 ; 1i 0 . Since the product of two fundamental representations contains the trivial one we obtain another eight - link connguration , j4 ; 2i 0 or j6 ; 2i 0 , as the nal state . Using the methods of appendix A the value of the corresponding matrix elements are computed to be 1=2 for the graph g . 2 . 3 ( a ) and 1=4 for the graph g . 2 . 3 ( b ) , respectively . Further transitions between states in H 0 b are j1 ; 1i 0 ! j2 ; a 2 i 0 belonging to the class g . 2 . 3 ( a ) and j3 ; ki 0 ! j5 ; ki 0 whose prototype is g . 2 . 3 ( b ) .

				</figure>

				<p>In the preceding section we have deduced the second order approximation of an operator that determines the dynamics in the eight - link sector E 8 . Perturbatively , the eigenvalues and eigen - states of this reduced hamiltonian can be obtained by an iteration of Bloch &apos; s method . Clearly speaking , one diagonalizes the rst order part exactly and regards the higher order contribu - tions as a perturbation . In case that there are eigenspaces of diierent energy the problem is further reduced leading to new eeective hamiltonians that act on lower dimensional Hilbert spaces . The rst order contribution to H 0 8 is connned to the single - particle channel and represented by the mass operator ( 2 . 16 ) . Among the 13 states fjk ; a k i 0 j k = 1 ; : : : ; 6g the degeneracy is partly lifted as H 0 b decomposes in seven orthogonal subspaces . To begin with one nds four one - dimensional and two two - dimensional eigenspaces with masses diierent from 6 . So these excitations decouple from the two - particle channel and represent bound states of the system . Regarding M 0 2 as a perturbation the second order correction to the various subspaces is determined straightforwardly by means of corresponding reduced hamiltonians . The degeneracy is not reduced any further , and the associated masses are</p>

				<p>So for this part of the spectrum the job is done .</p>

				<p>In addition , there is a ve - dimensional space H 00 b of single - particle excitations that remain degenerate with the two - glueball channel to rst order . One obtains a modiied two - channel system where the number of additional states coupled to H 0 sc is reduced from 13 to 5 . In order to construct a modiied reduced hamiltonian that acts on the reduced space of the two channels H 0 sc H 00 b and thus determines the scattering of the two four - link glueballs we specify a basis of normalized single - particle states</p>

				<p>In the heavy particle channel there is no interaction between the bound states . Concerning the channel coupling potential , eq .

The additional term V add describes a transition from H sc to H hp , propagation there according to G hp ( q ) with energy E 8 ( q ) , and return to H sc . As a consequence we must be aware of the occurrence of resonances in the collision of the light glueballs when the total energy exceeds the mass m 1 of the lowest lying heavy glueball . Furthermore , since the channel coupling is weak we expect a possible resonance to be sharp . For the scattering matrix one deduces the familiar result</p>

					<figDesc>Phase shifts in lattice gauge theory The physical quantities that characterize a scattering process are the phase shifts . Making use of the results obtained in the previous sections we can now discuss how the phase shifts for the elastic collision of the lightest SU ( 2 ) glueballs in two spatial dimensions are determined . Naturally , many ideas carry over from the detailed discussion of the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional Ising model in 1 ] . Therefore we can be rather concise from time to time . The exact eigenvalues of the scattering matrix are written as exp ( 2i ) . In order to label the phase shifts properly we rst consider the low energy regime . At small momentum the rotational symmetry gets restored on the lattice and the phase will behave like in the continuum . They can be identiied by their threshold behaviour which is ruled by the angular momentum quantum number l ( cf . appendix C . 2 ) . For each l one has to distinguish further between the symmetry sectors of the discrete symmetry group in two dimensions O ( 2 ; ZZ ) ( cf . appendix C . 1 ) . So the phase shifts carry the quantum numbers l ( ( ) .</figDesc>

					<figDesc>For an analysis of the small momentum behaviour of the leading order transition matrix we cannot use the explicit formula ( 2 . 87 ) since the matrix f N could not be determined analytically .</figDesc>

				<p>Instead we go back to eqs . ( 2 . 79 ) and ( 2 . 80 ) . The expressions ( 2 . 77 ) as well as the free solution can be expanded in powers of q straightforwardly . As far as the Green function is concerned it is shown in appendix B that</p>

					<figDesc>Hence , in order to obtain the threshold behaviour of the scattering solution we can neglect every term that vanishes like O ( q ) . In particular we replace all cosines by 1 on the RHS of ( 2 . 79 ) and ( 2 . 80 ) . Thereby the system of equations considerably simpliies and is easily solved .

				<p>The scattering of the two glueballs is invariant with respect to lattice rotations O ( 2 ; ZZ ) ( this discrete group of planar transformations is discussed in some detail in appendix C . 1 ) .

				<p>Hence T T 1 ( E 8 ; 0 ; ) has a series representation in powers of b q as well , and the coeecients are trigonometric functions of the primed and unprimed angular degrees of freedom . These terms can be expressed as sums of representation functions X l ( b 0 ) and X l ( b ) such that the integrals ( 3 . 17 ) can be evaluated algebraically .

				<p>In the A 1 sector , around q e &apos; 1 : 7 , the l = 0 scattering phase shows a behaviour that is typical in presence of a sharp resonance . Indeed , at q e = 1 : 707 the two - glueball energy E 8 ( q ) is equal to the mass m 1 of the lowest lying excitation in the heavy particle channel . So we are in a region where the additional potential ( 2 . 75 ) is relevant .

				<head>Concluding remarks and outlook</head>

				<p>The present paper demonstrates that a systematic strong coupling analysis of glueball scattering is feasible . For the case of SU ( 2 ) Yang - Mills theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions the phase shifts describing the elastic collision of the lightest glueballs could be calculated explicitly to leading order . A resonance was detected whose parameters could be determined accurately . Further investigations might go in two directions . The rst is to extend the present work to higher orders in the inverse coupling . This may be worthwhile since only the leading order approximation of the scattering quantities is known so far . Thereby one would achieve further insight into the nature of glueball scattering and could clarify the role of the resonance . I do not expect to meet any severe diiculties , although the diagonalization of the scattering matrix will be more complicated since the momentum dependence of the two - particle energy will probably be less simple to higher orders in the hopping parameter . From a technical point of view it would be desirable to develop an algorithm that generates the higher order reduced hamiltonians by computer .</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The second and maybe more interesting possibility is the investigation of lattice models that are of direct physical relevance . This would mean to go from two to three space dimensions ( from the point of view of strong coupling perturbation theory the diierences between SU ( 2 ) and SU ( 3 ) are negligible ) .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>The number of geometrically distinct Wilson loops of length eight increases from 5 to 15 , and the diierent classes contain up to 48 states . In addition , the four - link excitations receive a further ( spin ) degree of freedom since the plaquette may be oriented in either of the spatial directions . Clearly , the eight - link sector , which is the staring point for the derivation of an eeective two - glueball hamiltonian , is much more involved than in two space dimensions . However , I would like to emphasize that the resulting diiculties are not due to an unsuitable method but reeect the complexity of the theory itself . From the conceptual point of view all aspects are already present in the two - dimensional model . Therefore the procedure carries over almost verbatim and the problem can be tackled following the way described in great detail in the present work . In particular , one can be sure that the spectrum decouples to higher orders of the hopping parameter such that the eeective two - particle system simpliies . Still it must be expected that there are a number of resonances in the collision of two glueballs . Such a strong coupling analysis would help to clarify an early result of M unster 25 ] who found that the glueball interaction strength is extremely large . A possible explanation could be the existence of a resonance near threshold .</p>

				<p>In principle there is no obstacle to apply the concepts developed in 1 ] and this work for a qualitative investigation of the low - energy scattering of mesons and baryons . One interesting question which seems to be within reach of a strong coupling analysis is whether , in the pres - ence of light quarks , the decay of glueballs into pions is really suppressed as predicted by the phenomenological Zweig rule .</p>

				<p>A . 1 Elementary properties of the group SU ( 2 )</p>

				<p>The Lie group SU ( 2 ) consists of all unitary ( 2 2 ) matrices with determinant equal to 1 . The corresponding Lie algebra su ( 2 ) can be identiied with the space of all complex ( 2 2 ) - matrices</p>

				<p>deenes a map from su ( 2 ) onto SU ( 2 ) . The Lie algebra is a real vector space of dimension 3 . We choose a basis of hermitean matrices T a , a = 1 ; 2 ; 3 such that Tr T a T b = ( 1=2 ) ab : ( A . 3 )</p>

				<p>They satisfy T a ; T b ] = i &quot; abc T c : ( A . 4 ) where &quot; abc is the totally antisymmetric symbol on three indices . To be explicit , one often uses the familiar Pauli matrices T a = a =2 : ( A . 5 )</p>

				<p>With respect to such a basis any element X 2 su ( 2 ) can be written as X = iX a T a ; X a 2 IR</p>

					<figDesc>For complex functions f ( U ) on SU ( 2 ) a natural inner product can be introduced through ( f ; g ) = Z dUf ( U ) g ( U ) : ( A . 7 ) Here dU denotes the invariant group ( Haar ) measure which satisses d ( gUh 1 ) = dU for all g ; h 2 SU ( 2 ) . The associated square integrable functions represent the Hilbert space L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) . For any group element g 2 SU ( 2 ) one may deene an operator R ( g ) that translates the arguments U of the wave functions R ( g ) f ] ( U ) = f ( g 1 U ) : ( A . 8 )</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Thereby a representation of the group SU ( 2 ) on the linear space L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) is introduced . Since the scalar product ( A . 7 ) is based on the invariant integral , the representation is unitary . Using the exponential map we deene the operator</p>

					<figDesc>This equation introduces a representation of the algebra su ( 2 ) on L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) . Since R ( g ) is unitary and T y a = T a the operators E a = dR ( T a ) ; a = 1 ; 2 ; 3 ( A . 10 ) are hermitean . They are the innnitesimal generators of the transformation ( A . 8 ) . Using ( A . 9 ) it follows that R ( g ) = exp ( iX a E a ) if g = exp ( iX a T a ) ; ( A . 11 ) and one deduces the commutation relations E a ; E b ] = i &quot; abc E c : ( A . 12 )</figDesc>

				<p>commutes with all generators E a and is hence identiied with the quadratic Casimir opera - tor of the gauge group SU ( 2 ) . After choosing a parameterization of the group manifold the innnitesimal generators E a act as diierential operators in the group parameters on the wave functions f 2 L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) . In particular , E 2 is equal to the Laplace - Beltrami operator up to some constant . The eigenfunctions of the Casimir operator ( A . 13 ) transform irreducibly under the gauge group . Thus , to diagonalize E 2 we have to decompose the Hilbert space L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) into irre - ducible subspaces . It is well - known that the irreducible representations of SU ( 2 ) can be labeled by an integral or half - integral number j , the angular momentum . For a given j the represen - tation space has dimension n = 2j + 1 . So there is a one - to - one correspondence between the angular momentum and the dimensionality of the representation . Within the context of strong coupling perturbation theory it turns out to be more convenient if the irreducible representa - tions are labeled by their dimension . Therefore I will adopt this point of view throughout my thesis .</p>

Here 3 and 3 are identical representations . From a well - known theorem in group theory it follows that the direct product of two irre - ducible representations n 1 and n 2 of SU ( 2 ) forms a unitary representation of dimension n 1 n 2 of the same group . A basis for the product representation n 1 n 2 on the linear space L 2 ( SU ( 2 ) ) is provided by the set of functions</p>

				<p>In general , the product representation is reducible .

				<p>Throughout this thesis we only need some of the Clebsch - Gordon coeecients explicitly . They can be determined by means of a general theorem which states that the product of an irreducible representation and its complex conjugate contains the trivial representation exactly once and the adjoint representation at least once in its Clebsch - Gordon series ( cf . ref . 21 , sect . 16 . 6 ] , for example ) .

				<head>A . 3 Strong coupling matrix elements</head>

The actual value of ( A . 25 ) is calculated straightforwardly using the Clebsch - Gordon 39 series ( A . 21 ) and ( A . 22 ) . In the following I give a list of those matrix elements that contribute to the rst and second order processes relevant throughout this thesis . The simplest case is the product of two fundamental representations 2 2 = 1 3 ; and the associated non - vanishing matrix element is</p>

				<p>In case that the complex conjugate representation 2 occurs instead , the corresponding matrix element can be easily deduced from ( A . 26 ) by means of the similarity transformation ( A . 19 ) , for example h j U ab U a 0 b 0 y j i = ( 1=2 ) ab 0 ba 0 : ( A . 27 ) Three times the fundamental representation does not contain the trivial one , so there are no contributions from such matrix elements . In second order processes we encounter the product of four representation operators . The Clebsch - Gordon series tells us that the intermediate state may be in the trivial or adjoint representation</p>

				<p>The Green function ( 2 . 70 ) determines the coordinate dependence of the scattering solution describing the collision of two SU ( 2 ) glueballs in two dimensions . In order to calculate the corresponding transition matrix it has to be evaluated at various coordinate points . Substi - tuting the second order approximation of the kinetic energy ( 3 . 1 ) one obtains the integral representation G sc ( q ; r ) = (</p>

				<p>Mind that this is the two - dimensional counterpart of 1 , eq . C . 3 ] , so we can adopt many argu - ments from appendix C of 1 ] . But cautiously , the dimension is diierent . Clearly , there is a representation in terms of Bessel functions</p>

				<p><formula>G sc ( q ; r ) = ( 21=4 ) i Z 1 0 dt F sc ( t ) ; ( B . 2 ) with F sc ( t ) = exp h ( i=2 ) b q 2 4 t i e t 2 Y k=1 i r k J r k ( t ) : ( B . 3 )</formula></p>

				<p>Be careful not to interchange the t - integration and the limit ! 0 here because the asymptotic behaviour of a product of two Bessel functions is t 1 .</p>

				<p>In detail , the asymptotic expansion reads</p>

				<p>The series that is truncated after = N is denoted by F N sc ( t ) . As described in detail for the three - dimensional case we estimate the rest ( cf . 1 , eq . ( C . 11 ) ] ) and obtain an approximation for the Green function with arbitrarily small error</p>

				<p><formula>G sc ( q ; r ) = ( 21=4 ) i Z t N 0 dt F sc ( t ) + Z 1 t N dt F N sc ( t ) + O ( ) : ( B . 5 )</formula></p>

				<p>To be explicit I demand = 10 12 and choose N = 20 . Then the limit of integration turns out to be t N = 17 for r = 0 , for example . As far as the evaluation of the nite integral is concerned we can forget about the limit ! 0 in ( B . 3 ) , and the reader is referred to appendix C of 1 ] once more . We turn to the innnite integral in eq . ( B . 5 ) . Unless = 0 the integration over the summands of the asymptotic expansion ( B . 4 ) is well - deened even without the convergence factor e t , and we obtain a formula similar to 1 , eq . C . 13 ] . So it is only the contributions / t 1 from the asymptotic expansion of the integrand that make it necessary to discuss the calculation of the Green function in two space dimensions separately .

				<p>Contrary to the Ising model , where the Green function was needed only at r = 0 and r = ^ 1 for our purposes , the calculation of the transition matrix ( 2 . 87 ) aaords the evaluation of G sc ( q ; r ) at a considerably larger number of spatial points ( cf . eqs .

					<figDesc>C . 2 A simple quantum mechanical example One or the other of the readers may be not so familiar with quantum mechanical potential scattering in two space dimensions . Those are invited to go through a simple example which reveals some of the kinematical peculiarities . Consider the relative motion of two identical , non - relativistic bosons of mass m interacting via a rotationally invariant potential</figDesc>

			<note>( r ) = X lm lm ( r ) Y m l ( ) : ( C . 5 )</note>

				<p>The radial components can be written as lm ( r ) = c lm u l ( q ; r ) ; ( C . 6 ) where c lm is a suitable normalization factor and u l ( q ; r ) solves the radial Schrr odinger equation . The latter has two linearly independent solution given by the Bessel functions J l ( r ) and the Neumann functions N l ( r ) , for example . The physical wave functions are uniquely determined by means of the regularity condition lim r ! 0 r l u l ( q ; r ) = 1 : ( C . 7 )</p>

				<p>In case there is no interaction ( V 0 = 0 ) this condition selects the Bessel functions as the regular solutions , that is the wave functions describing the independent motion of the two particles . For large r , outside the interaction range , the scattering solutions must behave like the free ones , hence u l ( q ; r ) r ! 1 C l ( q ) cos qr ( l=2 ) =4 +</p>

			<note>l ( q ) ] p r : ( C . 8 )</note>

				<p>Here C l ( q ) is some coeecient , and the phase shifts l ( q ) reeect the eeect of the potential compared to the free solution . Now our demonstrative problem can be solved easily . Outside the range of the potential the regular solution is a linear combination of Bessel and Neumann functions u l ( q ; r ) = l ( q ) J l ( qr ) + l ( q ) N l ( qr ) for r &gt; R : ( C . 9 )</p>

				<p>Substituting the asymptotic expansion for J l ( qr ) and N l ( qr ) ( see ref . 22 , section 8 . 451 ] ) and comparing with ( C . 8 ) one obtains a relation between the coeecients l ( q ) and l ( q ) and the phase shifts l ( q ) of the system exp 2i l ( q ) ] = l ( q ) i l ( q )</p>

					<figDesc>Demanding continuity for the wave function and its rst derivative at r = R , the unknown coeecients in ( C . 9 ) can be expressed in terms of ( C . 11 ) . Substituting these results in ( C . 10 ) the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix are found to be</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>As for the well - known three - dimensional case , where the threshold behaviour of the phase shifts is l ( q ) / q 2l+1 , s - wave scattering is dominant at low energies . So it is only the l = 0 channel that contributes to the scattering amplitude near threshold</p>
