				<p>The physical variables for pure Yang-Mills theory in four-dimensional Minkow-skian space time are constructed without using a gauge-fixing condition by the explicit resolving of the non-Abelian Gauss constraint and by the Bogoliubov transformation that diagonalizes the kinetic term in reduced action (action on constraint shell). As a result, the reduced action is expressed in terms of gauge invariant field variables including an additional global (only time-dependent) one, describing zero mode dynamics of the Gauss constraint. This additional variable reflects the symmetry group of topologically nontrivial transformations remaining after the reduction.

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>The identification of physical degrees of freedom of the non -Abelian gauge theory is a crucial point for understanding physical phenomena hidden in its structure.</p>

				<p>The procedure of identification of physical variables and their separation ¿from nonphysical ones has been called the reduction procedure. There are two ways for the realization of the reduction : gaugeless and gauge fixing. In the former, independent physical variables are constructed by the explicit resolution of constraints. In this case nonphysical variables disappear and the remaining gauge invariant variables describe a usual unconstrained system. To avoid the difficulties with the resolution of complete constraints, one commonly uses the general method of Dirac [1], gauge -fixing approach, based on the introduction into the theory of some new &quot; gauge constraints &quot; and on replacement of the Poisson bracket by Dirac&apos;s one. However, there are also some problems in the Dirac approach. In particular, the gauge -fixing scheme is based on &quot; gauge equivalence &quot; theorem. The rigorous proof of gauge independence is known in the assumption of existence of asymptotically free states of elementary particles [2], [3]. The extension of this result to more general cases, including a nonperturbative one, is quite problematic. In this case to obtain a gauge invariant results a greater accuracy it is necessary to take into account nontrivial boundary conditions for gauge fields [4]. Another problem of gauge -fixing procedure for the non -Abelian gauge theory is Gribov&apos;s ambiguity [5] : there are many equivalent gauge field configurations obeying the same gauge condition. After the study of the space of orbits ( the space of gauge fields modulo the group of gauge transformations ) [6] it has been clear that the gauge -fixing procedure is not quite painless and it needs more rigorous treatment. For these reasons from time to time attempts have been undertaken to deal with the gaugeless method [7] -[12].</p>

				<p>In this article we would like to demonstrate that the gaugeless method of quantization allows us to describe the gauge invariant content of Gribov&apos;s ambiguity taking into account the collective variable inherent in gauge theory with nontrivial topological properties of gauge group.</p>

				<p>According to the gaugeless approach [7], [8], [12], the physical variables in the Yang -Mills theory is constructed in the following way : the non -Abelian Gauss&apos; constraint is solved with respect to the nondynamical time component of gauge field, and then a new gauge invariant variables are constructed with the help of the Bogoliubov transformation [13] in terms of the constraint solution. The solution of Gauss&apos; equation for nondynamical variable is definite within the arbitrary time -dependent functions. These functions for simple cases (e.g., electrodynamics in infinite space time) are excluded from consideration owing to boundary conditions for gauge fields. In the general case these functions arise in the kinetic term of the constrained action and thus these zero modes are physical variables. In particular, Bogoliubov&apos;s transformation is defined within the arbitrary time -dependent phase. The appearance of this phase in the framework of gaugeless method corresponds to the Gribov ambiguity in the gauge -fixing approach, where it can be treated as a collective variable for the group of transformations remaining after imposing the gauge condition. The paper will be organized as follows. In Section 2 we shall briefly describe the gaugeless method by example of QED in the four -dimensional Minkowskian space -time. Section 3 is devoted to the construction of physical variables in (1+3) dimensional SU (2) Yang -Mills theory with zero mode sector of Gauss&apos; law. The connection is shown of the phase zero mode variable with the winding number functional . We prove a no -go theorem about the local realization of the representation of a homotopy group without the collective mode, and show that the presence of a zero mode leads to another realization different from the &quot; instanton &quot; one [14, 15].</p>

				<p>In the last section the perturbation theory in terms of quasiparticles around the stable vacuum, corresponding to zero mode configuration, is proposed. All observables are determined after the averaging over the collective variable. It is noted, that the degeneration of physical states with respect to this collective variable can be cause of the color confinement.</p>

				<head n="2">Reduction of QED without gauge fixing</head>

				<p>To introduce the method of gaugeless reduction, let us begin with an example of electrodynamics in the instant form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W [A, ψ, ¯ ψ] = d 4 x 1 2 [(∂ 0 A i − ∂ i A 0 ) 2 − B 2 i ] + ¯ ψ(i ˆ ∂ − m)ψ + eJ µ A µ , (2.1) B i = ǫ ijk ∂ j A k .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the action (2.1) in accordance with the choice of time axis η · x = x 0 , the time component of vector field is distinguished. The main point of gaugeless reduction for electrodynamics is to resolve explicitly the Lagrangian constraint ∆A 0 = ∂ i ∂ 0 A i + J 0 . (2.2)</p>

				<p>Within the zero modes of operator ∆ (explanation will be given in the next section ) we can write down the solution for (2.2) in the form of the following decomposition</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>of A 0 : A 0 = A tr 0 + A J 0 , A tr 0 = 1 ∆ ∂ 0 ∂ j A j , A J 0 = 1 ∆ J 0 , (2.3) where A tr is varied under the gauge transformations A µ → A ′ µ = A µ + ∂ µ Λ, while A J 0</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>remains invariant. The kinetic term in eq.(2.1) according to this decomposition can be diagonalized with the help of the Bogoliubov transformation to the new variables [7]:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A I k [A] = v[A](A k − i 1 e ∂ k )(v[A]) −1 , ψ I [A] = v[A]ψ , (2.4) where v[A] = exp{i t dt ′ A tr 0 } = exp{i e 1 ∆ ∂ j A j } . (2.5)</trash>

					<figDesc>These variables are the gauge invariant functionals from initial gauge fields A I [A + ∂Λ] = A I [A]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>and satisfy, by the construction, the identity</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>∂ i A I i [A] = 0. (2.6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that this identity is the consequence of the explicit resolution (2.3). Thus, the functional A I [A] contains only two observable transverse fields</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A I i = a=1,2 e a i A I a</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>without selecting the Coulomb gauge as the initial supposition. The initial action (2.1) on the constraint shell (2.2) in terms of the new variables gets the form:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W Red [A I , ψ I ] = d 4 x   1 2 a=1,2 (∂ µ A I a ∂ µ A I a ) + 1 2 j I 0 1 ∆ j I 0 − j I i A I i + ¯ ψ I (i ˆ ∂ − m)ψ I   . (2.7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>So, we are ready to pass to the Hamiltonian form for our theory by using the conventional Legandre transformation for physical coordinates A I a . The quantization is achieved by imposing the canonical equal-time commutation relation between conjugate variables:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>[A I a (x), E I b (y)] = δ ab δ 3 (x − y).</trash>

					<figDesc>One can write down the generating functional for Green&apos;s function of the obtained unconstrained system in the form</figDesc>
					<trash>Z Red η [s I , ¯ s I , J I ] = a DA I a Dψ I D ¯ ψ I e iW Red [A I ,ψ I , ¯ ψ I ]+iS I , (2.8) with the external source term S I = d 4 x ¯ s I ψ I + ¯ ψ I s I + J I a A I a ] . (2.9)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>As to about on gauge and relativistic covariance in gaugeless scheme, there is subtle realization of Poincare symmetry – mixing of this rigid symmetry with gauge</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>one U −1 L ψ(x)U L = S(L) exp(ieΛ(x, L))ψ(Lx), U −1 L A µ (x)U L = (L) ν µ exp(ieΛ(x, L)) A ν (Lx) + i e ∂ µ exp(−ieΛ(x, L)). (2.10)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In particular, it has been proved that the infinitesimal Lorentz transformation of coordinates with parameters ε k corresponds to the transformation law for physical variables [11]:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A I i [A + δ L A] − A I i [A] = δ L A I + ∂ i Λ[A I ] , with the conventional Lorentz variation δ L A = LA supplemented by the gauge one: Λ[A I , J] = ε k 1 ∆ (∂ 0 A I k ) + ∂ k J 0</trash>

				<p>This form was interpreted by Heisenberg and Pauli [16] (with reference to the unpublished note by von Neumann) as the transition from the Coulomb gauge with respect to the time axis in the rest frame η 0 µ = (1, 0, 0, 0) to the Coulomb gauge with respect to the time axis in the moving frame</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>η µ = η 0 µ + δ L η µ 0 = (Lη 0 ) µ .</trash>

					<trash>Red Lη [s I , ¯ s I , J I ] = Z Red η [Ls I , L¯ s I , LJ I ]. (2.11) 2.1 Gauge equivalence theorem The usual form of the gauge – fixing Faddeev-Popov integral for generating functional of Green functions in the gauge F (A) = 0 is Z F [s F , ¯ s F , J F ] = µ DA F µ Dψ F D ¯ ψ F ∆ F F P δ(F (A F ))e iW [A F ,ψ F ¯ ψ F ] + iS F , S F = d 4 x ¯ s F ψ F + ¯ ψ F s F + J F µ A F µ ] (2.12)</trash>

				<p>where W is the initial action and ∆ F P is the Faddeev – Popov (FP) determinant.</p>

				<p>As was proved [2], [3]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>by the changing variables of integration of the type of (2.4), this representation coincides with the gauge invariant reduced result (2.8) only for the choice of the following form of the source term</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In the Feynman diagrams for Green function this gauge factor v[A F ] leads to so-called spurious diagrams (SD). Just these spurious diagrams restore the Feynman rules (FR) for the reduced functional (2.8). Thus, one can present the identity (F R) F + (SD) ≡ (F R) I (for Green&apos;s functions) (2.14) as a consequence of independence of the functional integral (2.12) of the choice of variables. It can be verified that in calculation of the elements of S-matrix transition between the elementary asymptotical states these spurious diagrams disappear on the mass shell surface. As a result, we get</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(F R) F = (F R) I (for elementary particles S-matrix ). (2.15)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This statement is known as the gauge equivalence or independence theorem [2]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>When the asymptotic states contain a composite particle or some collective excitations, the equation (2.15) is quite problematic and we are sure only in the</figDesc>
					<trash>identity (2.14) (F R) F + (SD) ≡ (F R) I (For S -matrix with composite particles). (2.16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The violation of the gauge equivalence theorem (2.15) in this case does not mean the gauge noninvariance and relativistic noncovariance. This violation reflects the nonequivalence of the different definitions of the sources (2.9) and (2.13) because of nontrivial boundary conditions and residual interactions forming asymptotical composite, or collective states.In this context, the notion &quot; gauge &quot; , in fact, is the gauge of sources in the FP -functional integral, but not only the choice of definite Feynman rules. As the gaugeless scheme takes into account explicitly the whole physical information from constraints, it is more correct to use this gauge -invariant and relativistic -covariant scheme for description of composite particles and collective excitations, rather than the Dirac approach with an arbitrary relativistic invariant &quot; gauge of sources &quot; . Below, we would like to demonstrate the preference of the gaugeless scheme with an example of collective excitations in the Yang -Mills theory.</figDesc>

(3.3) Let us choose some particular solution of the constraint (3.2) with the property lim | x| → ∞ a c 0 ( x, t) = 0 (3.4)</trash>

					<figDesc>and write down the general solution as a sum of this particular solution a 0 and the general solution Φ ( zero mode field) of the homogeneous equation:</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In terms of these variables the reduced action takes the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>W Red [A I Φ I ] = 1 2 d 4 x (∂ 0 A I i + ∇ i (A I )Φ I ) 2 − B 2 i , (3.8) where the fields ∂ 0 A I i , Φ I , B i satisfy the geometrical constraints ∇ ab i (A I ) ∂ 0 A bI i = 0 , ∇ ab i (A I )∇ bc i (A I ) Φ Ic = 0 , ∇ ab i (A I )B b i (A I ) = 0 . (3.9)</trash>

					<figDesc>It is clear that due to (3.9) the reduced action depends on the zero mode field Φ only through the surface terms on spatial infinity I E and I Φ :</figDesc>

				<p>The background field b( x) can be treated as the zero mode of the time derivative operator in the Gauss law ∂ 0 b I i = 0. As a consequence, we have the factorizable form for the zero mode field :</p>

				<p><formula>Φ(t, x) a | x| → ∞ = ϕ 0 (t)Φ a 0 ( x). (3.14)</formula></p>

				<p>To clear up the meaning of ϕ 0 (t) recall that by definition the variables A I describe local excitation, while zero mode field Φ is associated with some global (collective) dynamics of gauge fields. Such global properties of the theory are connected with the well -known topological invariant [14], [15]</p>

				<p>We can find the connection between the time -dependent part of the zero mode ϕ 0 (t) and this topological invariant after using the following decomposition for ν on the local and global parts:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ν Red = dt∂ 0 N T [A I , Φ I ] , N T [A I , Φ] = N L [A I ] + N 0 , (3.17) N L [A] = e 2 16π 2 d 3 xǫ ijk (A a i ∂ j A a k + 1 3 ǫ abc A a i A b j A c k ) , (3.18) ∂ 0 N 0 = d 3 x ¯ B i ∇ i Φ = ds i Φ ¯ B i | x| → ∞ . (3.19) Comparing (3.14) and (3.19) we get the desirable connection ϕ o = ∂ 0 N 0 I −1 B , (3.20) where the constant I B is determined via the stationary part of fields (3.13) at spatial infinity I B = ds i Φ 0 ¯ B i | x| → ∞ . (3.21) Finally, our reduced action gets the form: W Red [A I , N 0 ] = W Red L [A I ] + W Red G , W Red L [A I ] = 1 2 d 4 x ∂ 0 A I i 2 − (B i ) 2 , W Red G = dt(∂ 0 N 0 ) 2 I, I = I Φ /I 2 B . (3.22)</trash>

					<figDesc>From the reduced action (3.22) with zero mode we get an unexpected result:</figDesc>

				<p>There is a static solution of pure Yang -Mills theory with finite energy in four dimensional Minkowskian space -time [12].</p>

				<p>One can show that one of such static solutions coincides with the well -known</p>

				<p>Bogomoln&apos;yi – Prasad – Sommerfield (BPS) monopole solution of the Yang -Mills -Higgs system [18]. To prove this statement, it is enough to observe that the zero mode in the action (3.8) plays the role of the Higgs stationary field.</p>

				<p>It is usually assumed that all nontrivial topological properties of the gauge theory are connected with the existence of classical solutions of the Euclidean Euler – Lagrange equations with finite action — instantons. Recall that instanton calculations are based on consideration of the topological nontrivial gauge symmetry group [14], [15]</p>

				<p>One can use the assumption of compactification of three -dimensional space into a three–sphere S 3 . In this case all maps {g(x)} : S 3 → SU (2) can be split into the disjoint homotopy classes characterized by the integer index n:</p>

				<p><formula>n = 1 24π 2 d 3 x ǫ ijk tr V i ˆ V j ˆ V k ; ˆ V i = g ∂ i g −1 .</formula></p>

				<p>Thus, we can speak about the homotopy group π 3 (SU (2)) = Z. The configurations belonging to the different classes cannot be deformed continuously into each other.</p>

				<p>The gauge transformations which are deformable to identity are called small, while homotopically nontrivial ones n = 0 are large. For large gauge transformations the local topological variable N L [A] (3.18) varies as N L [A g ] = N L [A] + n. (3.26)</p>

				<p>These equations admit the factorization of the wave function on the plane wave describing the topological collective motion, with the momentum spectrum: P 0 = 2πk + θ and on the oscillator -like part depending on transverse variables : Ψ ǫ (N 0 , A I ) =&lt; P 0 |N 0 &gt; Ψ L [A I ] &lt; P 0 |N 0 &gt; = e iP 0 N 0 . (3.35)</p>

				<p>Thus, the consistent solution of the problem of the quantization of the Yang – Mills theory with nontrivial homotopy group is achieved by introducing an additional global variable arising in the process of reduction as zero mode of Gauss&apos; constraint.</p>

				<p>Generally speaking, for constrained system in the &quot; gauge &quot; ∇ ab i (A) ∂ 0 A b i = 0 (3.36) the generating functional for Green&apos;s function can be constructed [8] by using the conventional Faddeev – Popov functional integral [3]:</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Z[J]</head>

				<p>= µ D 4 A µ [det (∇ 2 (A i ))]δ(∇ i (A) ∂ 0 A i )e iW [A]+iS[J] .</p>

				<p>After the integration over A 0 it can be rewritten as Z[J]</p>

				</figure>

				<p>+iS[J] . (3.37)</p>

				<p>The calculation of this functional integral faces the problems of the existence of zeroes of FP determinant well known as the Gribov ambiguity of fixing variables [5]. In the gaugeless approach this ambiguity corresponds to the existence of the zero mode sector (3.5) and, accordingly, of two types of variables (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>3.6) and A Φ k = v Φ (A I k + ∂ k )(v Φ ) −1 , v Φ = T exp{ t dt ′ ˆ Φ I } , (3.38)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>satisfying one and the same gauge constraint (3.36). The above -introduced variables A I (3.6) are invariant under the small gauge transformations, while the variables A Φ are invariant against the large one. By the construction, the gauge factor v Φ neutralizes the large gauge transformation, as the factor v I neutralized the small one in (3.6) and the total topological variable has the form N T = N L [A I ] + N 0 = N L [A Φ ] + Invariant term. (3.39)</p>

				<p>In particular, for the BPS fields (3.24), the second Bogoliubov transformation is v Φ = e iN 0 τ a m a β(r) , (3.40) with function β(r) = 2π[coth (µr) − 1 µr ], and the invariant term in eq.(3.39) has the following form:</p>

				<p><formula>Invariant term = − sin(2πN 0 ) 2π . (3.41)</formula></p>

				<p>It is important to note that in the conventional Hamiltonian approach Gauss&apos; constraint is considered as the generator of small gauge transformations . In the gaugeless approach one can be convinced that Gauss&apos; constraint is responsible for both gauge transformations: small and large. The small gauge transformations are generated by Gauss&apos; constraint without zero mode, while the large by the zero mode (3.34).</p>

				<p>In the gaugeless approach, the requirement of gauge invariance of the observable quantities under the whole group of transformations (small and large) means that we should work in terms of variables A Φ . The gaugeless reduced configuration space besides the variables A Φ contains also the above -introduced topological variable N 0 and, therefore, in the expression of the corresponding generating functional there is an additional functional integral over it. To write down the generating functional we must separate the stationary asymptotic part b, which is accompanied by N 0 , ¿from the dynamical one</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ A Φ k ( x, t) = v Φ ˆ b I k ( x) + ∂ k + ˆ a I k ( x, t) v Φ = v Φ ˆ b I k ( x) + ∂ k v Φ + a Φ ( x, t). where (a Φ ) c = Ω cd ( x|N 0 (t))(a I ) d , the matrix Ω cd ( x|N 0 (t)) realizes the transformation (3.38) in the adjoint representation of the color group v Φ ˆ τ a (v Φ ) −1 = Ω ab τ b .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the following we shall call b the condensate and a the quasiparticle excitation.</p>

				<p>Thus, instead of (3.37) in the gaugeless reduce scheme we have the representation for the generating functional of Green&apos;s functions:</p>

				<p>The generating functional (3.42) is free from zeroes of FP determinant and corresponds to gauge invariant Green&apos;s functions of quasiparticles</p>

After the introducing the complete set of eigenfuctions ( ˜ ∆) cd ij f d j ( x|w) = w 2 f c i ( x|w)ǫ cf d , we can write the following expansion for the field a I : a I ( x, t) = w c + (w)f d j ( x|w)e +iwt + c − (w)f d j ( x|w)e −iwt</trash>

				<p>The function f d j ( x|w) is the amplitude of probability to find the quasiparticle with the energy w at the point x. For observable quasiparticle a Φ this amplitude has the form :</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The factor Ω reflects the degeneration of the quasiparticle energy under the topological variable and leads to the sum of Kronecker symbols δ P,Q±πβ(r) . This result can be treated as confinement of color states [8], [11]. For colorless states topological degeneration factors disappear and we get the conventional expressions for corresponding matrix elements. This scheme of topological confinement will be discussed in more detail in the forthcoming publication . It is worth to note that there are the values of the coupling constant e 2 = 2(| 2πk + θ |) −1 for which the background part W 0 [b] of the action (3.44) is compensated by the collective motion one W G .</p>

				<head n="4">Summary</head>

				<p>We have discussed the method of quantization of the Yang -Mills theory in which the nondynamical variables are eliminated by the explicit resolving of the classical</p>

				<figure>
					<head>Gauss constraint ∇ 2</head>

					<figDesc>(A)A 0 − ∇ i (A)∂ 0 A i = 0, and then quantum theory is built up for the action on the constraint shell. We take into account the zero modes of all operators in the constraint: – the condensate b(x) as a zero mode of the operator ∂ 0 ∂ 0 b(x) = 0, – the phase angle Φ(x) as a zero mode of the operator ∇ 2 (A)</figDesc>
					<trash>∇ 2 (A)Φ = 0.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This zero mode is associated with the collective coordinate which restores the gauge invariance of the theory, broken in any particular solution of this constraint. At this point the situation is quite similar to the case of semiclassical soliton quantization, based on the introduction of collective coordinates [21] for taking into account the breaking of rigid global symmetries (e.g., translation, rotation, etc.). The collective variable allows us to separate zero modes of the Faddeev -Popov determinant and to solve the problem of gaugeless version of Gribov&apos;s copies. There is a significant difference between the Yang -Mills theory with the collective variables and the conventional one. In particular, it has been shown that in the former there is a static stable solution that corresponds to the well -known</p>

				<p>Prasad -Sommerfield solution in the conventional Yang -Mills theory interacting with Higgs&apos; field. In the gaugeless reduced Yang -Mills the zero mode Φ(x) plays the role of the Higgs field .</p>

				<p>The collective variable associated with the phase angle Φ describes the dynamical realization of the homotopy group π 3 (SU (2)) = Z in the Minkowskian space.</p>

				<p>In contrast to the instanton version with integer winding number functional, in the dynamical realization the collective variable as winding number is continuous. Just the averaging over the continuous winding number leads to confinement of gauge invariant color fields configuration due to the phenomenon of the complete destructive interference.</p>
