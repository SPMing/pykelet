Rubiera August 2000 Chairman: J. Yelton Major Department: Physics</trash>

				<p>We report the first observation of exclusive decays of the type B → D * N ¯ N X, where N is a nucleon. Using a sample of 9.7 × 10 6 B ¯ B pairs collected with the CLEO detector operating at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we measure the branching fractions B (B 0 → D * − p¯ pπ + ) = (6.5</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The charge conjugate process is implied in the reconstruction of B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + . However, in the reconstruction of B 0 → D * − p ¯ n, only the mode with the antineutron is used in our measurement because neutrons do not have a distinctive annihilation signature.</p>

				<p>Antineutrons are identified by their annihilation in the CsI electromagnetic calorimeter. Since we are unable to isolate a sample of antineutrons in data, we use antiproton annihilation showers in a ¯ Λ → ¯ pπ + sample to define the antineutron selection criteria. We find a discrepancy for antiproton annihilation showers between the Monte Carlo and data, which we assume affects antineutrons as well.</p>

				<p>We increase the raw yield for B 0 → D * − p ¯ n by 21% to correct for this discrepancy.</p>

				<p>→ p ¯ n are eliminated from the analysis by rejecting events with 1.91 GeV &lt; M p+¯ n &lt; 2.04 GeV for a loss of 9% in the reconstruction efficiency. We fail to find evidence for the decay D + s → p ¯ n.</p>

				<p>We search for possible contributions to the resonant substructure of B</p>

				<p>p ¯ n, as well as a resonance of the virtual W decaying to p¯ pπ + . We also study the possible effect of feed-down ∆ baryon contributions to the background for both modes, as well as the B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + signal. No conclusive evidence is found for a measurable contribution from the aforementioned contributions to the resonant substructure.</p>

				<p>Antineutrons are used for the first time in the exclusive reconstruction of a B meson. By finding conclusive evidence for the existence of decay modes of the type B → DN ¯ N X, we challenge the assumption that the B → Baryons rate is dominated by decays to charmed baryons.</p>

				<p>The study of the elementary particles at a wide range of interaction energies has occupied scientists since the discovery of the electron in 1896 [1]. Particle physics has evolved from a field involved in the discovery of new particles to one devoted to their systematic study. A logical structure, currently explained by the Standard Model of elementary particles [2, 3, 4], has been unveiled.</p>

				<p>The Standard Model, however, offers an incomplete picture of some experimental high energy physics results. The results we describe are amongst these.</p>

				<p>Despite some weaknesses, the Standard Model has withstood intense experimental scrutiny, and while some of the equations are currently not calculable, evidence has not been found for physics beyond the Standard Model. Particles acquire their masses in the Standard Model via the Higgs mechanism, that requires the existence of a massive gauge boson, the Higgs boson, that has yet to be found.</p>

				<p>We first introduce particle physics phenomenology -particles and their decays, which is the information most often used by the practitioner of experimental high energy physics. A discussion of the current status of B physics phenomenology follows. Finally, we review B → Baryons previous to our results, concluding with an overview of our work and its significance.</p>

				<head n="2">1.1 Matter</head>

				<p>Matter is composed of three types of indivisible constituents: leptons, gauge bosons, and quarks. Leptons and gauge bosons are found individually in Nature . Quarks combine in two types of arrangements to form hadrons. The first arrangement is of the form quark-antiquark, and is called a meson. The second arrangement, three quarks, is called a baryon. Mesons and baryons, collectively known as hadrons, comprise all the known forms of matter consisting of quarks. Hadronic matter is said to be colorless. A color is assigned to each quark in a meson or a baryon. The three quarks in a baryon each have a different color−red, green, blue− and the combination of all three colors yields a colorless hadron. The quark and the antiquark in a meson form a color-anticolor pair (e.g. q blue ¯ q blue ).</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="1.1.1">Hadrons</head>

				<p>There are three families of quarks, each consisting of two types of quark: an up-type quark, with electromagnetic charges +2/3 that of the electron, or (+2/3) q e , and a down-type quark, with (-1/3) q e . Every type of quark is called a flavor of quark.</p>

				<p>The first and lightest family consists of the up (u) and down (d) quarks. The next family, with heavier quarks, is the charm (c) and strange (s) family. Even heavier still is the third family: the top (t) and bottom (b) quarks. All are shown in Table 1.1.</p>

				<p>For every matter constituent there is an anti-matter constituent with opposite electromagnetic charge and equal mass, as shown in Table 1.2.</p>

				<p>Quarks are not found individually in Nature. Their masses can be estimated by the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons that has been measured to date.</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Table 1.3 we show current best estimates of the lower and upper limits for quark masses. The estimated masses for quarks are useful in current Standard Model calculations. However, the quark mass estimates have large uncertainties, especially in the case of the up and down quarks. The values quoted in this Table and the next values quoted in this section are from the 1998 Review of particle physics [5]. The mass of the top quark m t = 173.8 ± 5.2 GeV.</p>

				<p>The leptons, the e, the µ, and the τ , are fundamental particles. Each can be produced with an accompanying neutrino, ν l , with l = e, µ, or τ . Neutrino physics in the near future will yield a better understanding than is currently available.</p>

				<p>Neutrinos have been thought to be massless and not to mix (that is, each neutrino flavor was thought only to interact with its lepton partner). The recent observation of neutrino mixing, however, implies that neutrinos have mass [6]. Unlike quarks, leptons are observed as single particles with well-measured masses. In Table 1.6 we show the current mass measurements. Large differences in masses are found between the electron, the muon, and the tau.</p>

				<head n="1.1.5">The CKM Matrix</head>

				<p>The interactions of quarks from different flavor families are suppressed with respect to those within the same family. In order to correct for this discrepancy, the characteristics of a given decay as prescribed by weak theory are adjusted using the flavor mixing 3 × 3 unitary and complex matrix V , the Cabibbo-Kobayashi- Maskawa matrix [5], which transforms the weak d, s, b quark states to the physically measured d ′ , s ′ , b ′ quark states, to arrive at a correct theoretical understanding of a weak decay for all quark flavors:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>V CKM =         V ud (0.9745 − 0.9760) V us (0.217 − 0.224) V ub (0.004 − 0.013) V cd (0.217 − 0.224) V cs (0.9737 − 0.9753) V cb (0.036 − 0.042) V td (0.004 − 0.013) V ts (0.035 − 0.042) V tb (0.9991 − 0.9994)         with         d ′ s ′ b ′         = V         d s b        </trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The diagonal elements of V are ≈ 1, implying that decays which involve these CKM matrix elements are Cabibbo-allowed, whereas all other decays, which involve off diagonal elements, are Cabibbo-suppressed. For example, a b → cW − , W − → ¯ cs decay has a much larger decay rate than a b → cW − , W − → ¯ cd decay.</p>

				<head n="1.1.6">Symmetries</head>

				<p>A particle and its antiparticle are said to be symmetric under CPT transformations , where C is charge conjugation, P is parity, and T is time reversal. The inversion of parity acts like a mirror in the inversion of space coordinates. CPT symmetry is valid for all forces.</p>

				<p>A subset of this symmetry is CP. The product of a charge conjugation and a parity inversion affect a particle the same as its antiparticle. When CP is violated, a particle will prefer a different subset of decays than its antiparticle. Such is the case for neutral kaons.The K 0 and ¯ K 0 states in weak theory are different from the physically observed strong states, the K S , or K-short and the K L , or K-long, each with its respective antiparticle. Short and long refer to the respective decay lifetimes. Charge symmetry is obeyed implicitly in neutral kaon decay, but parity is violated. CP violation is evident in the difference in decay rates of K S &apos;s and K L &apos;s to final states of two and three pions, the former being even under parity, and the latter odd under parity [7]. CP violation in B decays and will be the focus of many studies in the near future.</p>

The top quark decays well before the time required to form hadrons (baryons or mesons). Therefore, the bottom group of baryons (e.g. Λ b , with quark content bud) and mesons (e.g. B c , with quark content b¯ c) is the group of hadrons with the largest masses currently found in Nature.</p>

				<p>decays of baryons follow a similar pattern. These decays are referred to as semi-leptonic decays since the final products are a combination of a weak leptonic decay and quark hadronization.

				<head n="1.2.2">Strong Decays</head>

				<p>The weak decays of the heavy (charm and bottom) quarks in mesons and baryons often involve the secondary emission of strongly-interacting soft gluons.</p>

				<p>While we understand the weak component of these decays using the Standard Model, the strong component is not calculable.</p>

				<p>The strong interaction hadronization process is not well understood theoretically when soft, or low momentum, gluons mediate the decay. The Standard Model is based on perturbation expansions which rely on convergence. A process involving soft gluons yields equations that are no longer perturbatively convergent. This stumbling block has prevented us from understanding many details of unstable particle decay, particularly for the case of heavy hadrons, in which the large mass available in the decay implies a very large number of possible final decay products from an equally large number of soft gluons. The D * meson, for example, which we reconstruct in this analysis, is a spin 1 meson that decays via the strong interaction. Two possible Feynman diagrams for this decay are shown in Figures 1.3 and 1.4. Our ignorance about soft gluon strong interactions forbids us from knowing the proportion of the total decay rate due to any one diagram.</p>

				<head n="1.3.2">Heavy Quark Effective Theory</head>

				<p>The properties of the D and B mesons, which are composed of a heavy quark and a light anti-quark, have been described using heavy-quark symmetry [12, 13] by Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). In a meson, a quark and an antiquark are confined to a bound state in a cloud of virtual quarks and gluons which need to be incorporated into any calculation. In the case of a heavy meson, such as a B meson, the heavy quark has a substantially larger mass than the light antiquark. In HQET, the heavy quark is independent of the light anti-quark. HQET assumptions simplify the Standard Model equations, allowing, for instance, the comparison with theory of experimental values of V ub and V cb .</p>

				<p>The effective Lagrangian that is used to characterize B decays is given by [14, 15]:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>L ef f = −2 (2)G F J µ CC J † CC,µ + h.c., where G F , the Fermi constant, is 1.17 GeV −2 , and J µ CC is the charged weak current given by: J µ CC = (¯ ν e , ¯ ν µ , ¯ ν τ )γ µ         e L µ L τ L         + (¯ u L , ¯ c L , ¯ t L )γ µ V CKM         d L s L b L        </trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The assumption that the heavy quark mass m Q is effectively infinite is used to simplify the QCD Lagrangian. The heavy quark and the light quark are decoupled, and the effect of the cloud of virtual light quarks, light antiquarks, and gluons is assumed to be small enough to be ignored. The QCD Lagrangian, of which L ef f is a simplified version, is simplified to: L Q = ¯ Q(iγ µ D µ − m Q )Q where D µ is the QCD covariant derivative.</p>

				<p>In the limit m Q → ∞ the strong interactions of the heavy quark become independent of its mass and spin and the effective Lagrangian is further simplified to: L HQET = ¯ h v iv · Dh v where h v is the effective heavy quark field and v is the hadron&apos;s velocity, which is close to that of the heavy quark.</p>

				<p>In the calculation of HQET quantities, the strong interaction effects that are non-perturbative are grouped into a form factor that includes a dimensionless probability function, the Isgur-Wise function ξ(v · v ′ ) [16], where v and v ′ are respectively the initial and final velocities in a scattering or decay process. An example of the role this function plays is the elastic scattering of a B meson. The hadronic matrix element for this process is:</p>

In the next section we discuss semileptonic B decays, for which HQET has been successfully used to derive decay rates.</p>

				<head n="1.3.3">Semileptonic Decays to Mesons</head>

				<p>The combination of large branching fractions and high reconstruction efficiencies have allowed experiments such as CLEO to measure several semileptonic B decays with high accuracy [17]. This wealth of experimental results has allowed phenomenologists to compare theory and experiment. The decay kinematics of a specific B semileptonic decay dictate the type of form factor contributions to the decay rate. In the case of ¯ B → D * l¯ ν, for example, there are no 1 m Q corrections to the decay rate. This behavior, which is explained by Luke&apos;s theorem [18], implies that the HQET-derived decay rate for ¯ B → D * l¯ ν has low sensitivity to higher order perturbative corrections as well as non-preturbative effects.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="1.3.4">Hadronic Decays to Mesons</head>

				<p>Whereas HQET has been useful in describing semileptonic B decays, an equally accurate description of hadronic B decays using HQET has only recently begun to be pursued for two-body decays to mesons [19, 20, 21]. Whereas in semileptonic B decays one of the two currents in a matrix element is weak, and therefore calculable to all orders in perturbation theory, in the hadronic case we have matrix elements of four-quark operators with hadronic uncertainties due to the exchange of gluons and quarks.</p>

				<p>In energetic hadronic two-body B decays hadronization is assumed to take place after the quarks that form each of the two hadrons have traveled sufficiently long distances for there to have been no significant exchange of gluons or quarks between them. This decay characterisitic is referred to as factorization, in which the matrix elements of four-quark operators factorized to independent current elements for each hadron. By using the operator product expansion (OPE) [22, 23], the weak interaction effects are treated as separate from the long range strong interaction effects. The HQET effective weak hamiltonian for b → c, u transitions after this procedure is given by:</p>

The Λ c , Σ c and Ξ c charmed baryons have been inclusively measured in B decays [25, 26].

				<p>Based on our current knowledge of B → Baryons, there must be processes other than Λ c production that contribute to the B → Baryons rate. It is our goal to find evidence for B → Baryons decays which do not involve a Λ c . Dunietz [32] suggested that modes of the type B → DN ¯ NX, in which D represents any charmed meson, and N a proton or neutron, are likely to be sizeable. B → DN ¯ N X final states can arise either from the hadronization of the W boson into a baryonantibaryon pair, or from the production of a highly excited charmed baryon that decays strongly into a baryon plus a charmed meson. CLEO previously reported an inclusive upper limit for B(B → DN ¯ NX) at the 90% confidence level of &lt; 4.8 %[24]</p>

					<figDesc>The choice of these two modes is guided by the following criteria: 1. D * mesons have the lowest signal contamination among the D mesons. 2. Both decays can occur via external W decay. Although this characteristic is not a principle, to date only the b → c decay modes that have been measured share this characteristic. The reasons for the predominance of these decays are not known. 3.

However, in the reconstruction of B 0 → D * − p ¯ n, only the mode with the antineutron is used in our measurement because neutrons do not have the distinctive annihilation signature. These measurements invalidate the previous assumption that B → Baryons is dominated by Λ c decays, while establishing evidence for the existence of a new type of B decay mechanism with a sizeable decay rate. The thesis is divided as follows: In Chapter 2 we describe the CLEO detector. We place special emphasis on the electormagnetic calorimeter, which we use to select antineutron candidates.</trash>

The beams collide almost head-on, resulting in a center-of-mass total energy of ≈ 10.6 GeV. It is in the energy range near this value that the Υ resonances, with the quark content b ¯ b, are produced. As shown in Figure 2.1, the Υ(1S) to Υ(4S) resonances are found in the energy range 9.44 GeV to 10.62 GeV. The Υ(4S) is above the threshold for strong decay to B ¯ B pairs to take place. Close to 100% of the Υ(4S) decay rate is to nearly equal numbers of charged and neutral B ¯ B pairs.</p>

				<p>Data is taken at the Υ(4S) resonance (to be referred to as ON resonance) to study B decays. Because approximately 2/3 of the ON resonance data are composed of events in which the initial q ¯ q pair is not an Υ(4S), a sample of data is also taken 60 MeV below the resonance (to be referred to as OFF resonance) in order to subtract the non-Υ(4S), or continuum component of the ON resonance data. The e + e − annihilation at or near the Υ(4S) resonance yields a wide variety of possible final states, some which are shown in Table 2.1. The decay product of an e + e − annihilation is called an event. Because final states differ greatly in cross section (the frequency with which events of a given topology are produced) some event types are produced with high frequency, while other event types are produced with low frequency.

				<head n="2.2">Tracking System</head>

				<p>A charged particle traversing a magnetic field in the presence of charged wires in a chamber containing gas will ionize this gas as it loses energy. We measure the time at which this process takes place as well as the energy collected by each wire. These measurements allow us to know the position of the particle in time and the energy released at a number of points, or hits, along its trajectory. For a given momentum, the rate at which a particle loses energy along this trajectory, measured as dE/dx, is dependent on its mass, thus allowing us to separate protons, kaons, and pions. The TOF (Time-of-Flight) of a particle in a scintillating medium is also dependent on its mass and momentum. TOF measurements yield a second way to separate protons, kaons, and pions.</p>

				<head n="2.2.1">PTL Detector</head>

				<p>The PTL detector is an inner drift chamber composed of six layers of straw tubes. There are 64 axial wires for each layer, and there is a half cell stagger between sequential layers. The PTL detector does not measure the longitudinal, or z-axis, position of the particle. The PTL transverse position measurements are more precise than those from the drift chamber.</p>

			</div>

				<head n="2.2.2">SVX Detector</head>

				<p>In later running of CLEO II, the PTL drift chamber was replaced by a 3-layer SVX detector capable of longitudinal as well as axial measurements [35], each measurement taking place on the two sides of each of the silicon wafers. The radii of the SVX layers are 2.35 cm, 3.25 cm, and 4.75 cm, for layers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It is composed of 96 wafers arranged into 8 octants of 12 wafers each, with 26,208 data readout channels. The intrinsic resolution from e + e − → µ + µ − events at normal incidence is 29 µm.</p>

				<p>The improved measurement resolution of the SVX detector in comparison with the PTL detector allows for more accurate determination of the event vertex. This advantage is most useful to lifetime studies, yet it does not affect greatly the results presented here.</p>

				<head n="2.2.4">Momentum and Angular Resolution</head>

				<p>There are two factors that affect the track momentum resolution: 1. The error in the measurement of the track curvature due to the hit-level measurement error in drift distance. This resolution component is parametrized by a term linear in p t , the transverse momentum. 2. Multiple scattering at material boundaries which cause the track trajectory to deviate from a helix. This resolution component is parametrized by a constant term.</p>

We expect δφ and δθ to be higher for the tracks we use in our analysis since muons have a much lower probability of multiple scattering than do other charged particles. 2.2.5 dE/dx Measurements</trash>

					<figDesc>The degree of separation we are able to achieve is shown in Figure 2.4 for the CLEO II data. The 51 layers of the outer, or main, drift chamber−to be referred to as DR−are used to measure the specific ionization energy loss (dE/dx) of particles.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>A mixture of argon-ethane gas was used in the main drift chamber for the CLEO II data. This mixture was changed to helium-propane during data taking for CLEO II.5, which allowed for an improvement in the dE/dx resolution, resulting in better charged particle separation. In Figure 2.4 each of the particle bands has been plotted after a subtraction of some of the higher dE/dx data points in a given particle band. The main drift chamber has contiguous cells each with a sense wire surrounded by field wires, as shown in Figure 2.5. Overall, there are three field wires for every sense wire in the main drift chamber. A number of corrections are applied to optimize the resolution: 1. Dip angle saturation: tracks perpendicular to the sense wires have the highest density of ionization along the z direction. The amount of collected charge is reduced by electric shielding for these tracks. 2. Drift distance: varies depending on the field configuration of each cell. 3. (r, φ) entrance angle: its magnitude as well as its sign is field dependent. 4. Axial-stereo layer: cells for axial and stereo layers have a different field de- pendence.</p>

The choice of thalium doped CsI for the calorimeter crystals took into consideration factors such as cost, resistance to cracking, high density, and short radiation length (1.83 cm). Because the calorimeter is 16.4 radiation lengths deep, ≈ 1% of the energy of a 5 GeV electron leaks out of it. There are 6,144 barrel crystals and 828 crystals for each</p>

The electrons and positrons in Bhabba events deposit almost 100% of their energy in the calorimeter. Crystal noise, which is in the range of a few MeV, does not affect this sample appreciably. The set of constants obtained from the crystal-to-crystal calibration needs to be updated only every few months. The main change is the preponderance of a few crystals to become noisy. A clustering algorithm for CLEO should accomplish the following: 1. Match tracks to showers. 2. Allow π 0 reconstruction. 3. Allow separation of photons and K L &apos;s from antineutrons. There are two clustering packages in the CLEO II data: CCFC, and XBAL. Both accomplish these three requirements. Even though we use CCFC, using XBAL would have yielded results similar at the few % level. Our discussion of clustering is limited to CCFC. A discussion of clustering using XBAL would be similar to ours.</figDesc>

				<p>In order to separate shower clusters from noise, only cells with energy &gt; 10</p>

				<p>MeV are considered as candidates for the center of a shower. Only cells that are at most two cells away from a cell in the cluster are added to the cluster, which allows cells without an energy measurement to be located inside a cluster. The number of cells N that is considered a cluster is a function of the total energy of the cluster. For example, 4 cells correspond to a 25 MeV shower, 17 cells to a 4</p>

				<p>GeV shower.</p>

				<p>The position vector, which contains the directional cosines, is determined using a weighted sum of the energy measured with each cell, using the geometric center of each to define a centroid. Two corrections, one lateral, and another longitudinal , are applied to this position vector. These corrections account for calorimeter segmentation as well as depth into the CsI crystal of the shower center.</p>

				<head>CHAPTER 3 PARTICLE SELECTION</head>

				<p>In order to reconstruct B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + and B 0 → D * − p ¯ n we need to have low background samples of all the decay daughters. Protons, antiprotons and pions are selected as single tracks, the m D * -m D 0 distribution is used to select D * &apos;s, and shower selection criteria is used to select antineutrons. We select the B decay daughters from ON resonance hadronic events. The ON resonance candidates can be fully or partially reconstructed B mesons, or background candidates from ON resonance continuum events. The OFF resonance candidates can only be continuum events as the total event energy is below the energy threshold for B ¯ B production . We use the Mn fit histogram package [36], and its function fitting utility, MINUIT [37], both of which are widely used by experimental high energy physicists.</p>

				<p>To suppress the already small number of continuum background candidates in our reconstructions, we select events using the parameter R2GL [38]. R2GL is a measure of how the momentum is distributed for the event. A high value of R2GL corresponds to continuum events, in which the initial quarks hadronize to form a two-body decay. The B ¯ B momentum distributions are the result of two separate two-body or higher decays that can be most approximately described by a spherically symmetric momentum distribution, which tends to yield a low value of R2GL.</p>

				<head n="3.3">Track Selection</head>

				<p>A combination of measurements is used to select quality tracks that are most likely to be the particle type we need for a given reconstruction-pion, kaon, or proton. The tracks we use in our reconstruction are particles that are stable (in the case of protons), or decay outside our detector (in the case of kaons and pions).</p>

				<p>Therefore, a track is assumed to begin near the interaction point, which is within a solid volume defined by the uncertainty with which we can measure the beam spot. This volume is a few microns wide in x and y and a few hundred microns wide in z.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="3.3.1">Fitting Algorithm</head>

				<p>Tracks are fitted using DR hits by a Kalman algorithm that is based on the assumption that the track is a helix inside a vacuum. The change of trajectory due to material interaction is taken into consideration in the track fit. The fit is performed from both ends of the track. The inward fit begins a hit-to-hit swim, adding hits to form a track, analogous to the way beads are strung to form a necklace. Where there is more than one hit to a layer of the drift chamber, the hit with the better resolution is chosen. The outward fit begins at the outermost layer of the drift chamber, performing a hit swim into the drift chamber.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="3.3.2">Drift Chamber Track Variables</head>

				<head n="3.3.3">The TRKMNG Package</head>

				<p>A software package is used to reject duplicated tracks from curlers [39]. A curler is a low momentum track which is bent more than one revolution inside the drift chamber. A curler spirals inside the drift chamber as the momentum of the particle decreases. The tracking algorithm will often assign a track number in the list of tracks for each half-revolution. The TRKMNG package selects the half-revolution that is most likely the closest to where the track began to curl, rejecting all other half-revolutions. The variable used in the TRKMNG Package is tng(track) ≥ 0.</p>

				<p>All negative numbers of tng(track) are for the redundant half-revolutions.</p>

				<head n="3.4">Particle Separation</head>

				<p>By population size alone, all tracks are pions. The purpose of particle separation , or particle ID, is to separate tracks that are likely to be something other than a pion from the overwhelmingly more numerous pions. Protons are produced with a significantly reduced rate, therefore constituting a small background to all other charged particles. The predominant backgrounds to protons are kaons, pions, electrons and muons. For the case of kaons, pions represent the largest background . The kaon in ¯ D 0 →K + π − has more phase space available than the kaon in</p>

					<figDesc>&apos;s in this decay are soft, with momenta &lt; 500 MeV. The decay angle for π 0 → γγ is large enough at this momentum range for the individual γ&apos;s not to overlap. On average there are 7 π ± &apos;s in a B ¯ B event. The average number of π 0 &apos;s, as of yet unmeasured, should be near this number. Since shower multiplicity increases with decreasing shower energy, as π 0 momentum decreases, the combinatoric shower background increases. A minimum momentum of 100 MeV is required of our π 0 candidates to suppress this background. A shower is considered a γ if the ratio between the summed energy of a 3 by 3 grid of shower cells over the same are extended to a 5 by 5 grid of shower cells is almost 1. This ratio is referred to as E9OE25. Most photons have most of their energy concentrated within a 3 by 3 grid of shower cells. We require at least one of the γ&apos;s to be in the good barrel section of the calorimeter, which is defined as |cos(θ γ )| &lt; 0.71. When one of the γ&apos;s is not in the barrel, we require that it not be from the overlap region between the barrel and endcap sections of the calorimeter or near the beam pipe, both of which yield degraded shower energy measurements.

				<p>The KNLIB fitting package is a collection of kinematic routines used for track vertexing [41]. We use it to vertex D 0 &apos;s and D * &apos;s. D 0 &apos;s are vertexed using the KNLIB routine KNVTX3. A new invariant mass is calculated with this vertex, and only the D 0 mass range 1.70 to 2.03 GeV is allowed to pass on to D * reconstruction.</p>

				<p>To form a D * vertex, we use KNLIB routine KNBVXK which combines the D 0 decay products and the π s track to make a vertex-constrained mass from which m D * -m D 0 is calculated. We use KNBVXK with the flag IVOPT set to 1 for the π s i .e. the π s is constrained to pass through the vertex formed by the other particles, but not used to determine that vertex. The latter method offers a noticeable improvement over other options tested, including use of π s track when vertexing, as well as using the D 0 vertex instead of the individual D 0 tracks when vertexing the D * . We place a loose cut of χ 2 &lt; 100 on the D * vertex fit for all three modes.</p>

The best fits are obtained with non-zero ∆ M EAN &apos;s. ∆ M EAN is the difference between the mean value of each of the two Gaussians. We integrate the double Gaussian, keeping 95% of the signal symmetrically from the PDG mean. 5.

The double Gaussian fits yield better agreement than the single Gaussian fits. There is a significant drop in reconstruction efficiency for all three D 0 modes in the CLEO II.5 data.

				</figure>

				<p>We need to define a set of criteria which allows us to select antineutrons with high accuracy without incurring a large loss in efficiency. The following characteristics , some limiting, some exploitable, apply to antineutron showers in the CLEO II electromagnetic calorimeter: 1. The antineutron shower yields an incomplete measurement of its energy and an accurate measurement of its direction. We use the antineutron shower energy to select candidates, but cannot use this energy when reconstructing the B candidate. We can use the well-measured shower direction. 2. Antineutrons frequently annihilate with matter in the calorimeter. Since antineutron annihilation showers have distinctive characteristics that enable us to separate them from other showers, we use these characteristics to select them. 3. By baryon number conservation, if the event has an antineutron, it must have a corresponding baryon. In an exclusive reconstruction, as is ours, the selection of an proton increases the probability of there being an antineutron in the event substantially due to baryon number conservation. In addition, once we have selected a D * , only shower candidates within a narrow momentum cone can be selected in the event.</p>

				<p>We refer the reader to other studies of baryon-antibaryon annihilation [43, 44].</p>

				<p>We are limited by the absence of an independent antineutron sample that we can study to define our selection criteria. However, antiprotons also annihilate with nucleons in the calorimeter. Therefore, antiproton annihilation showers compose the shower sample in data and Monte Carlo which we use to define our antineutron selection criteria as well as to gauge how well the Monte Carlo models antineutron annihilation showers.</p>

				<head n="3.7.1">Shower Parameters</head>

				<p>We use the CCFC clustering package to select antineutron candidates. The CCFC shower package was not optimized to separate annihilation showers from other showers in the calorimeter. Nevertheless, we find that the parameters previously optimized to include photons, such as E9OE25, the list of nearby showers, and track-to-shower matching, are useful in excluding them as well.</p>

				<p>The shower parameters used are: 1. E9OE25 &lt; cut 1, a pre-determined value: E9OE25 has been defined in our discussion of π 0 &apos;s. It is very close to 1 for photons, and, we find, farthest from 1 for annihilation showers, overlapped π 0 &apos;s-which are not merged, but have the two photon showers very near each other, and K L &apos;s. An energy dependent cut, cut 1, on E9OE25, is applied to reject 99% of isolated photons. 2. NNESH: List of nearby showers (which does not include the shower to which the list belongs). The area encompassed increases with energy. It is in this list that we find showers near the antineutron that are most likely to be hadronic split-offs. We call the shower associated with the list the main shower, and sum the energy of it and all the others in NNESH, we call a group. In B 0 → D * − p ¯ n CLEO II signal MC, showers in the NNESH list are tagged to the parent shower in excess of 93 % of the time. 3. |(cos(θ)|: The calorimeter can be divided by polar angle θ into sections: good barrel, bad barrel, barrel/endcap overlap, bad endcap, good endcap, and near beampipe. We use the good barrel section throughout, which corresponds to |(cos(θ)| &lt; 0.71. 4. Match level: The track to shower match levels in CCFC&apos;s NTRSH array are: (a) Match level 1: shower center &lt; 8 cm from the track projection. (b) Match level 2: not level 1, but ≥ 1 member crystal (c) Match level 3: not level 1 nor level 2.</p>

				<p>We use match 3 showers for antineutron candidates and match 1 and 2 showers for antiprotons.</p>

				<p>Lacking a sample of antineutrons to study in data which is independent of the sample we will use to measure B 0 → D * − p ¯ n and B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + , we use antiproton annihilation showers which have been matched to a track. Antiprotons, like antineutrons, annihilate with matter in the calorimeter. The annihilation group of showers that results from this process has a distinctive signature: the antibaryon interaction is associated with a main shower, which has most of the energy of the annihilation, and the hadronic splitoffs from the interaction are associated with satellite showers near the point of interaction, each making a small contribution to the group energy.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Figure 3.8 we use the same selection criteria as was used for Figure 3.7 with the exception of a rejection cut, E9OE25 &lt; cut 1, to suppress non-annihilation showers. The antiproton annihilation showers are typically those with E main &gt; 300 MeV and in the track momentum range 500 MeV to 900 MeV. Note that for these showers there is only a loose correlation between the reconstructed energy of the shower and the momentum of the antiproton that produced it. We can identify an annihilation shower, but have a very poor measurement of the momentum of the particle that produced it.</p>

				<p>The horizontal line at shower energy 200 MeV, sloping upwards at PQCD 1</p>

				<p>GeV, corresponds to minimum ionizing protons and antiprotons. The rest of this Figure 3.7: E main vs. PQCD for protons and antiprotons in CLEO II line in the lower momentum range corresponds to minimum ionizing pions. In the case of protons, before an E9OE25 cut is applied, the diagonal line corresponds to protons captured in the calorimeter. 1.0 GeV momentum is the threshold for this capture. Neutrons, analogously to protons, do not annihilate, and, since we have neither momentum information nor distinguishable showers, the study of B decays with neutrons is beyond CLEO&apos;s capabilities.</p>

				<p>Using antiproton annihilation showers, we devise the antineutron selection criteria to be used when reconstructing B 0 → D * − p ¯ n , as shown in Table 3.8.</p>

				<p>Although this selection criteria allows a shower to have no nearby daughters, in which case E main = E group , the majority of antineutron showers have at least one Figure 3.8: E main vs. PQCD for protons and antiprotons in CLEO II nearby daughter in Monte Carlo, as well as in our exclusively reconstructed B 0 signal events.</p>

				<p>According to our generic Monte Carlo simulation, even before a proton requirement is applied 27.8% of the annihilation-like showers in a B ¯ B event are antineutrons . We next apply the proton requirement to a generic B ¯ B Monte Carlo sample.</p>

				<p>The above results are not surprising: use of baryon number conservation by selecting a proton increases the probability of an event having an antineutron from a few % to 50 %, while leaving all other annihilation like backgrounds at near the same level.

			</div>

				<head n="4.1">Monte Carlo Reliability</head>

				<p>The reconstruction process at CLEO, as well as at all other high energy detectors , involves a reconstruction efficiency ǫ Data . For any given B decay, only a fraction of the number present in the data can be partially or fully reconstructed.</p>

				<p>If x number of B decays in our data are B → Baryons decays, only ǫ Data × x are measured. In the case of B → pX, for example, there is a significant contamination due to protons from beam gas interactions at the low end of the momentum spectrum which limits B → pX to be carried out using antiprotons only, and then multiplying the result by 2.</p>

				<p>By tuning a wide range of parameters, the Monte Carlo simulation can be made to closely resemble the data, in which case the assumption ǫ Data ≈ ǫ M C is reasonable. ǫ M C is reliable because several processes which are measured at CLEO allow considerable ease of simulation as well as large samples which can be reliable 76 separated from backgrounds.

				<head n="4.2">Reconstruction Procedure</head>

				<p>B mesons are produced with ≈ 300 MeV momentum at CLEO, which implies that E beam is very close to E B . This momentum is small when compared with the B meson mass of 5.28 GeV. Since the beam energy at CLEO is measured with a 2 MeV resolution, we can constraint the mass of the B meson candidate to be equal to the beam energy E beam . We therefore use the beam contrained mass when</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>reconstructing B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + : M BC = E beam 2 − 3 i p i 2 where E beam is the beam energy, on average 5.29 GeV, and 3 i p i 2 is the sum of daughter momenta squared.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The energy difference between the beam energy and the energy of the reconstructed B candidate, defined by: ∆ E = E beam -E reconstructedB is centered at 0 and has a Gaussian width similar to the M BC Gaussian width, whereas background events are much more likely to form a random distribution in ∆ E . Selecting B candidates using ∆ E cuts based on the Monte Carlo is useful in separating signal from background. As modelled by our Monte Carlo ∆ E for B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + is centered near zero and has a Gaussian width σ &lt; 100 MeV, which allows us to separate the signal from backgrounds that differ by a miss-measured extra pion. The methodology we use in measuring B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + is analogous to that used in previous exclusive reconstructions at CLEO [45, 46].</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<head n="4.3">Monte Carlo Study</head>

				<p>In order to find the detector efficiency for the reconstruction of the modes we are searching for, we generate Monte Carlo in which one of the B mesons in the event is forced to decay to the mode we are reconstructing. We refer to this sample as signal Monte Carlo. In this signal Monte Carlo B mesons decay according to phase space.</p>

				<p>We also use a sample of generic Monte Carlo B ¯ B events on which we run the B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + analysis code. The generic sample is composed of the B decays that have previously been measured as well as randomnly generated events assuming inclusive momentum distributions. There are no B → [D]N ¯ N X modes in the generic Monte Carlo sample. We use the generic Monte Carlo sample to model our backgrounds due to modes of the D 0 we are not reconstructing.</p>

				<p>Applying the particle selection criteria outlined in Chapter 3 for the B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + decay daughters, we fit the ∆E distribution to a single Gaussian for signal and a 1st order Chebyshev polynomial for background. We show in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 the result of these fits.</p>

				<head n="4.5">Resonant Substructure</head>

				<p>In order to determine whether we are using the correct ǫ M C to measure B(B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + ), we need to know if we are measuring B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + or a mode with intermediate particles decaying to the same combination of decay daughters.</p>

				<p>We therefore search for possible contributions to the resonant substructure of B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + . Any measurable resonant substructure would have to be subtracted from the inclusive measurement of B(B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + ), and the ǫ M C would likewise have to be adjusted.</p>

				<head n="4.5.1">Two-body Decay and Possible Strong Resonances</head>

				<p>We search for two types of resonances: 1. A heavy charmed baryon decaying strongly to ¯ p + D * − . No significant peaking is observed. 2. A resonance of the virtual W decaying to p¯ pπ + , B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + being a two body decay. No significant peaking is observed.</p>

				<p>We study the M p+¯ p+π + spectrum in data to check if it is consistent with phase space or two-body decay. For the two-body sample we generate MC with a fictitious heavy particle that decays to p¯ pπ + for B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + . It has a mass of 2.6</p>

				<p>GeV and a width of 200 MeV.</p>

				<p>No conclusive evidence is found for a measurable contribution to B(B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + ) from these possible contributions.

				<p>As mentioned in Chapter 4, we have selected the B → [D]N ¯ N X modes which are expected to have the lowest backgrounds as well as the highest reconstruction efficiency. When reconstructing B 0 → D * − p ¯ n , however, we encounter a stumbling block not encountered in the reconstruction of B 0 → D * − p ¯ p π + by virtue of the former mode having an antineutron-or a neutron in the case of its charge conjugateas one of its decay daughters. Our inability to separate neutron showers from their backgrounds reduces the reconstruction efficiency for B 0 → D * − p ¯ n by 50%. The antineutron reconstruction efficiency, however, is sufficiently large (in the range of 30 to 40%). We do not have an accurate measurement of the antineutron energy, yet we do have a well measured direction of its shower, which we use to reconstruct B 0 → D * − p ¯ n . The reconstruction method we use is analogous to that used in an unpublished reconstruction of B → J/ΨK L by CLEO [47]. In Table 5.1 we outline our antineutron selection criteria which we derived in Chapter 3.</p>

				<p>Instead of M BC , we define m B 0 , in which we set ∆E = 0 and assign the missing energy to the antineutron using the directional cosines of its shower. Since the measured shower energy for an antineutron, even after summing the energy in the list of nearby showers, fails to match the total energy of the antineutron, we only use the electromagnetic shower energy as part of our selection criteria.</p>

				<p>The reconstruction steps for this mode are: 1. E ¯ n =E beam -E D * +p is assigned to the antineutron. This energy difference is the equivalent of setting ∆E = 0, or E beam = E reconstructedB . 2. 3-momentum magnitude of antineutron candidate p ¯ n =</p>

				<p>The Monte Carlo we use has not been optimized to model nucleon-antinucleon annihilation. We find a discrepancy between the reconstruction efficiency for data and Monte Carlo for antiprotons. We consider the discrepancy credible and change the antineutron efficiency using a Correction Factor. We assume that the Monte Carlo fails to model antineutrons by the same amount as it does for antiprotons, even though the quark content of antiprotons and antineutrons is different.</p>

					<figDesc>We define ǫ annihilation as the efficiency for an antibaryon shower to pass the annihilation shower cuts outlined in Table 3.8. This quantity will be different for antiprotons and antineutrons. In the former case we choose a sample which is inevitably biased by the momentum range in which we can separate antiprotons from other charged tracks. In the latter case we use a sample which has shower backgrounds.</figDesc>

				<p>This work comprises the second successful exclusive reconstruction of B →</p>

				<p>Baryons modes, after the exclusive reconstructions of B + → ¯ Λ c pπ + and B 0 → ¯ Λ c pπ + π − carried out by CLEO in 1997 [29]. In Table 6.1 we summarize all the exclusive B → Baryons measurements to date. We rank the modes from largest to smallest branching fraction central value. The first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The Λ c modes have a third uncertainty, which is systematic and is due to the error in the determination of B(Λ + c → pK − π + ).</p>

					<figDesc>As shown in Table 6.1, the size of the branching fractions we are measuring in this work are of the same order of magnitude as those previously measured in decay modes including a Λ c . We are unable to extrapolate the exclusive results to compare the relative magnitude of the inclusive modes with or without a Λ c .</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>For instance, the available phase space for the production of more light mesons is larger in the case of modes with a Λ c than in the case without, which may cause the B → Λ c X inclusive rate to be larger than the B → [D]N ¯ N X inclusive rate. However, we think it reasonable to assume that the measurements we have at our disposal to date are representative of the inclusive modes. We infer that B → [D]N ¯ N X modes contribute significantly to the total B →</p>

					<trash>Baryons decay rate. 6.1 B → Baryons phenomenology</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The B → Baryons theoretical models attempted to date [48, 49] rely on the assumption that the B meson decays to two decay daughters, which is the twobody assumption. Unlike two-body B meson modes, most B → Baryons modes, including all four that have been measured to date, have at least three decay daughters. Most B → Baryons modes also have a varied resonant substructure.</p>

				<p>The assumption that the hadronization process takes place at a late stage in the decay, which allows for a substantial simplification of the equations due to the suppressed dependence on the exchange of gluons and light quarks, is justified in hard two-body decays. However, in many-body decays there can be re-scattering of the hadronizing quarks and multiple exchanges of soft gluons and virtual quarks.</p>

				<p>Notwithstanding the calculational difficulties of many-body B → Baryons decays such as the ones we measure here, progress continues to be made using HQET to explain B meson decay. The focus has been on decays for which HQET can be used to extract the most information, and which can be used to search for CP violation [14, 15]. Future attempts to theoretically explain B →</p>

					<figDesc>The ability to reconstruct antineutron modes should allow for the reconstruction of modes of type B → (Λ c , Σ c )¯ nX. Modes of type B → (Λ c * , Σ c * )¯ pX, and B → Ξ c ¯ Λ c , which have low reconstruction efficiencies in CLEO II/II.5, are also worth pursuing. B → Baryons for b → sg, and b → u modes will also be of interest and likely within range. If previous measurements of the meson modes are used as a guide,</figDesc>

					<figDesc>Semileptonic b → c B → Baryons decays, such as B + → Λ c − pl + ν l , with l = e, µ, due to the low reconstruction efficiency at CLEO for low momentum leptons, have not been measured. The substantially larger dataset expected in CLEO III may compensate for the low reconstruction efficiency. A mode such as B + → ¯ ppl + ν l should be feasible. This latter mode can be used as an auxiliary in the measurement of |V ub |.</figDesc>
