				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>This paper investigates a mapping class group action on a certain Poisson algebra and on the representation spaces of the associated quantum algebra. This Poisson algebra, in the following referred to as flower algebra, plays an important role in the combinatorial description of the phase space of Chern-Simons theory with semidirect product gauge groups of the form G ⋉ g * , where G is a Lie group, g * the dual of its Lie algebra and G acts on g * in the coadjoint representation. Its classical structure and quantisation were studied in an earlier paper [23].</p>

				<p>Although mapping class groups and Chern-Simons gauge theories are research topics in their own right, our interest in them is motivated by their relevance to physics. Chern- Simons gauge theory with gauge group G ⋉ g * occurs in the Chern-Simons formulation of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant [25], where, depending on the signature of the spacetime, the gauge group is the three dimensional Poincaré or Euclidean group. For spacetimes of topology R × S, where S is an oriented surface of arbitrary genus, possibly with punctures and boundary components, large diffeomorphisms of the surface S give rise to Poisson symmetries or canonical transformations on the phase space [22]. There is evidence suggesting that these symmetries play an important role in the physical interpretation of the theory, in particular for the dynamics of gravitationally interacting particles [12, 8].</p>

				<p>The flower algebra emerges in a description of the moduli space of flat connections on a genus g surface S g,n with n punctures, discovered by Fock and Rosly [14] and developed further by Alekseev, Grosse and Schomerus [3, 4, 5]. In this description, the moduli space is given as a quotient of the space of holonomies associated to a set of n + 2g generators of the surface&apos;s fundamental group equipped with a certain Poisson structure. In our case, these holonomies are elements of G ⋉ g * , and one obtains a Poisson structure on the manifold (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g . The flower algebra is the algebra of a particular class of functions on (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g with this Poisson bracket. In [23], we investigated the classical properties of this Poisson algebra and constructed the corresponding quantum algebra and its irreducible Hilbert space representations.</p>

				<p>In this paper, we show that the mapping class group Map(S g,n \D) of the surface S g,n with a disc D removed acts on the flower algebra and determine the associated quantum action.</p>

				<p>We prove that the mapping class group action on the flower algebra is a Poisson action and show that the action of Dehn twists around embedded curves on the surface S g,n \D can be expressed in terms of a G-action that is infinitesimally generated via the Poisson bracket. For the case where the exponential map exp : g → G is surjective, we give explicit Hamiltonians whose flow by one unit is equal to the action of Dehn twists. These flows are special examples of the Hamiltonian &quot; twist flows &quot; studied by Goldman in [16], but the particular Hamiltonians we consider and their relation with Dehn twists appear to be new.</p>

				<p>We then demonstrate how these classical features are mirrored by corresponding structures in the quantum theory. We show that elements of the mapping class group act as algebra automorphisms on the quantised flower algebra and implement this action on its representation spaces. This allows us to relate the quantum action of the mapping class group to different representations of the quantum double D(G) of the group G. We find a canonical way of associating a representation of the quantum double D(G) to each embedded curve, such that the action of the corresponding Dehn twist is given by the ribbon element of D(G). We find an implementation of the exchange of punctures on the surface S g,n \D in terms of the action of the universal R-matrix in the tensor product of two representations of D(G), familiar from the theory of quantum groups.</p>

				<p>The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 gives a summary of our results in [23] required for the understanding of this article, which is necessarily rather condensed. In Sect. 3 we discuss the mapping class group action on the classical flower algebra and express the action of Dehn twists in terms of infinitesimally generated group actions as outlined above. Sect. 4 investigates the corresponding quantum action and relates it to representations of the quantum double D(G), followed by a brief outlook in Sect. 5. The appendix lists a set of generators of the mapping class group and their actions on the fundamental group π 1 (S g,n \D).</p>

				<p>We consider groups G⋉g * which are the semidirect product of a finite-dimensional, simply connected and connected Lie group G and the dual g * of its Lie algebra g = Lie G, viewed as an abelian group. All Lie algebras are vector spaces over R unless stated otherwise, and Einstein summation convention is used throughout the paper. Following the conventions of [20], we define Ad * (g) to be the algebraic dual of Ad(g), i. e.</p>

Writing elements of G ⋉ g * as (u, a) with u ∈ G and a ∈ g * , we have the group multiplication law (u 1 , a 1 ) · (u 2 , a 2 ) = (u 1 · u 2 , a 1 + Ad * (u −1 1 )a 2 ).

				</figure>

				<p>The flower algebra plays an important role in the description of the phase space of Chern- Simons theory with semidirect product gauge groups of type G ⋉ g * . Mathematically, this phase space is the moduli space of flat G ⋉ g * -connections on the surface S g,n , and it can be described as a quotient of the space of holonomies holonomies associated to a set of generators of the surface&apos;s fundamental group. Fock and Rosly [14] and Alekseev, Grosse and Schomerus [3, 4, 5] defined a Poisson structure on the space of holonomies, which, via Poisson reduction, gives rise to the canonical Poisson structure on the moduli space [15, 6]. For Chern-Simons theory with compact, semisimple gauge groups, this Poisson structure on the space of holonomies was investigated by Alekseev, Grosse and Schomerus [3, 4, 5] and quantised via their formalism of combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons gauge theories. The case of (non-compact and non-semisimple) semidirect product gauge groups of type G⋉g * was studied in [23], where we discussed the properties of this Poisson structure and developed a quantisation procedure.</p>

				<p>In order to define the flower algebra for Chern-Simons theory with gauge group G ⋉ g * on a punctured surface, we need a set of generators of the surface&apos;s fundamental group. Both the fundamental group π 1 (S g,n ) of a genus g surface S g,n with n punctures and the fundamental group of the associated surface S g,n \D with a disc D removed is generated by the equivalence classes loops m i , i = 1, . . . , n, around the punctures and two curves a j , b j , j = 1, . . . , g, for each handle, shown in Fig. 1. In the case of the surface S g,n \D with a disc removed they generate the fundamental group freely, whereas for the surface S g,n they are subject to the relation [b g , a −1 g ] · . . . · [b 1 , a −1 1 ] · m n · . . . · m 1 = 1, with [b i , a</p>

				<p>Whereas the holonomies A j = Hol(a j ), B j = Hol(b j ) associated to each handle are general elements of the group G ⋉ g * , the holonomies M i = Hol(m i ) around the punctures lie in fixed G ⋉ g * -conjugacy classes</p>

				<p>Note that this definition does not restrict the holonomies M i associated to the punctures to fixed G⋉g * -conjugacy classes C µ i s i . Instead, these conjugacy classes arise as the symplectic leaves of the Poisson structure (2.10) on (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g . Furthermore, we showed in [23] by extending the work of Alekseev and Malkin [2] to groups of type G ⋉ g * that the Poisson structure on the symplectic leaves is given by a symplectic potential Θ on (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g .</p>

				<p>This potential can be expressed in terms of the holonomies as follows</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Theorem 2.2 (Symplectic leaves and decoupling) The symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g with bracket (2.10) are of the form C µ 1 s 1 × . . . × C µnsn × T * (G) 2g , where C µ i s i denote G ⋉ g * -conjugacy classes as in (2.7). Let ω F denote the symplectic form on these symplectic leaves, define a map β : G n+2g → G n+2g β : (v M 1 , . . . , v Mn , u A 1 , . . . , u Bg ) →(v M 1 g µ 1 v −1 M 1 , . . . , v Mn g µn v −1 Mn , u A 1 , . . . , u Bg ) (2.11) =: (β M 1 (v M 1 , . . . , , u Bg ), . . . , β Bg (v M 1 , . . . , u Bg )) and extend it trivially to a map τ : (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g → (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g via τ :(v M 1 , j M 1 , . . . , v Mn , j Mn , u A 1 , j A 1 , . . . , u Bg , j Bg ) → (2.12) (β M 1 (v M 1 , . . . , u Bg ), j M 1 , . . . , β Bg (v M 1 , . . . , u Bg ), j Bg ). Then, the pull-back τ * ω F of ω F with τ coincides with the exterior derivative of the symplectic potential Θ = n i=1 d(u M i−1 · · · u M 1 )(u M i−1 · · · u M 1 ) −1 − dv M i v −1 M i , j M i a P a (2.13) + g i=1 d(u K i−1 · · · u M 1 )(u K i−1 · · · u M 1 ) −1 , j A i a P a − d(u −1 A i u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 )(u −1 A i u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 ) −1 , j A i a P a + g i=1 d(u −1 A i u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 )(u −1 A i u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 ) −1 , j B i a P a − d(u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 )(u −1 B i u A i u K i−1 · · · u M 1 ) −1 , j B i a P a , where u K i = [u B i , u −1 A i ] = u B i u −1 A i u −1 B i u A i .

				<p>[23], we made use of this link between the flower algebra Poisson structure (2.10) and the symplectic potential Θ (2.13) to construct the corresponding quantum algebra and to investigate its representation theory. We obtained the following theorem</p>

				<p>We found in [23] that the representation theory of this algebra is best investigated in the framework of representation theory of transformation group algebras. As the discussion is quite technical, we summarise only the main result and refer the reader to [23] for further details and some technical assumptions on the group G. Further information about transformation group algebras can be found in [18], which gives a treatment closely related to our situation.</p>

				<p>As a diffeomorphism invariant theory, Chern-Simons theory on R × S g,n is in particular invariant under orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of S g,n which are not connected to the identity. The equivalence classes of such diffeomorphisms constitute the surface&apos;s mapping class group Map(S g,n ) [10]. Therefore, one would expect the mapping class group to act via Poisson isormophisms on the phase space of Chern-Simons theory, the moduli space of flat connections. The moduli space is obtained from the set of holonomies around the curves in Fig. 1 by imposing the relation (2.6) and dividing by conjugation. In the flower algebra, by contrast, the relation (2.6) is not imposed and therefore there is no group action of Map(S g,n ) on the flower algebra. We shall now show that, instead, there is a a group action of the mapping class group Map(S g,n \D) on the flower algebra, and that this action is Poisson.</p>

				<p>The mapping class group Map(S g,n \D) is the group of equivalence classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of S g,n \D which fix the punctures as a set and the boundary of the disc D pointwise; diffeomorphisms are equivalent if they differ by one which is isotopic to the identity. It contains elements that leave the punctures invariant as well as elements that exchange different punctures. The former, by definition, form the pure mapping class group PMap(S g,n \D) related to the mapping class group by the short exact sequence 1 →</p>

				<p>where i is the canonical embedding and π : Map(S g,n \D) → S n the projection onto the symmetric group that assigns to each element of the mapping class group the associated permutation of the punctures. As explained in [9, 10], the pure mapping class group PMap(S g,n \D) is generated by Dehn twists around a set of embedded curves, and a set of generators of the full mapping class group Map(S g,n ) can be obtained by supplementing this set with n − 1 elements which get mapped to the elementary transpositions via π. A set of generators of the pure and full mapping class group and their action on the fundamental group is given in in the appendix.</p>

				<p>The action of the mapping class group on the flower algebra arises in the following way. Elements λ ∈ Map(S g,n \D) act as automorphisms on the fundamental group π 1 (S g,n \D) and give rise to transformations of the holonomies along the generating curves m i , a j , b j , thus inducing a map (</p>

The push-forward with Λ defines a map Λ * : C ∞ ((G ⋉ g * ) n+2g ) → C ∞ ((G ⋉ g * ) n+2g ), which</trash>

(3.6) This allows us to lift the action Λ G ∈ Diff(G n+2g ) of elements λ ∈ Map(S g,n \D) to an actioñ Λ G ∈ Diff(G n+2g ) related to Λ G via (3.6). We can extend Λ G to a diffeomorphism Λ on (G ⋉ g * ) n+2g by taking its action on (g * ) n+2g to be the one defined by Λ, which yields a mapping class group action λ ∈ Map(S g,n \D) → ˜ Λ ∈ Diff((G ⋉ g * ) n+2g ) satisfying (3.3).</trash>

Parametrising the holonomy of the curve γ as Hol(γ) = (u γ , −Ad * (u −1 γ )j γ ) and expressing it as a product of the holonomies M i , A j , B j , we can introduce coordinate maps j γ a analogous to (2.8) j γ a ∈ C ∞ ((G ⋉ g * ) n+2g ) : (M 1 , . . . , M n , A 1 , . . . , B g ) → j γ a , a = 1, . . . , dim G.

				<p>Also, these G-actions should act on the group elements associated to the punctures by conjugation and left-multiplication, respectively, such that for each g ∈ G ρ γ (g), ˜ ρ γ (g) ∈ Diff(G n+2g ) are related by (3.5). If such G-actions exist, they are uniquely defined by (3.9), (3.10), since every element of the group G can be written as a product of elements in the image of the exponential map. Remarkably, it is possible to define such G-actions ρ γ , ˜ ρ γ for each embedded curve γ on S g,n \D, and to relate them to the actions Γ G , ˜ Γ G of the Dehn twist around γ.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Theorem 3.2 (Action of the Dehn twists on G n+2g ) For any embedded curve γ on the surface S g,n \D, Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10) define associated G-actions ρ γ , ˜ ρ γ : G → Diff(G n+2g ) related by (3.5), which conjugate and, respectively, left-multiply the group elements associated to the punctures. In terms of these group actions, the actions Γ G , ˜ Γ G ∈ Diff(G n+2g ) of the Dehn twist around γ on G n+2g can be expressed as Γ G = ˜ ρ γ (P −1 γ • β) Γ G = ρ γ (P −1 γ ), (3.11) where P ±1 γ : G n+2g → G, P ±1 γ : (u M 1 , . . . , u Bg ) → u ±1 γ maps to the (inverse of ) the Gcomponent of Hol(γ) = (u γ , −Ad * (u −1 γ )j γ ) expressed as a product in the G-components u M 1 , . . . , u Mn , u A 1 , . . . , u Bg .

				<p>Because of identity (3.6) and the commutative diagram (3.3), it is sufficient to prove the existence of such a G-action for the modified Poisson bracket { , } Θ and the actioñ ρ γ . 1. As a first step, we show how a G-actioñ ρ γ associated to an embedded curve γ that satisfies (3.10) and (3.11) gives rise to a corresponding group actioñ ρ ξ for all curves ξ that can be obtained from γ via the action of Map(S g,n \D).

					<trash>Using (3.2) and the definition (3.5) of the lifts, we deduce that the associated actions Γ G , ˜ Ξ G on G n+2g satisfy Ξ G = ˜ Λ −1 G • Γ G • Λ G . On the other hand, the invariance of the symplectic potential Θ (2.13) under Λ implies {j ξ a , F } Θ = {j γ a , F • Λ −1 G } Θ • Λ G ∀F ∈ C ∞ (G n+2g ), (3.12) since j ξ a = a j γ • Λ, and this allows us to define a G-actioñ ρ ξ : G → Diff(G n+2g ) via ˜ ρ ξ (g) := ˜ Λ −1 G • ρ γ (g) • Λ G ∀g ∈ G.

				<p>Using the invariance of the Poisson bracket under the mapping class group and the corresponding identity for γ, we see immediately that ρ ξ satisfies (3.10). Furthermore, since Λ G acts on the group elements associated to the punctures by left-multiplication and permutation , we see that ρ ξ acts on these elements by left-multiplication if the same is true for ρ γ .

				<p>We therefore only need to prove (3.11) for a set of curves containing one representative for each orbit of the Map(S g,n \D)-action on π 1 (S g,n \D). Such a set of curves can be constructed using results from geometric topology [17]. It has been shown, see for example Lemma 2.3.A. in [17], that the equivalence classes of all non-separating curves γ on the surface S g,n \D, i.e. curves γ such that (S g,n \D) \ γ is connected, are in the same orbit under the action of the mapping class group. This is a consequence of the classification of two-dimensional surfaces via the Euler characteristic. We can apply the same argument to separating curves if we keep in mind that, unlike the handles, the punctures of our surface S g,n \D can be distinguished via the conjugacy classes assigned to them. This allows us to conclude that any two separating curves γ, γ ′ on S g,n \D such that the two components of (S g,n \D) \ γ and (S g,n \D) \ γ ′ contain the same number of handles and the same sets of punctures lie in the same orbit under the action of the mapping class group. It is therefore sufficient to prove (3.11) for one non-separating curve, for example any of the curves in (A.1) except κ ν,µ , and the separating curves γ i 1 ...irj 1 ...js pictured in Fig. 2</p>

				<p>) allow us to identify the former with a basis of the space of vector fields Vec(G n+2g ). From the first set of brackets in (2.10) it is then clear that the commutator of two vector fields agrees with the Poisson bracket of the associated elements in g n+2g ⊗ C ∞ (G n+2g ).</p>

				<p>As the flower algebra is multiplicatively generated by the coordinate functions j X a and functions in C ∞ (G n+2g ), this defines the mapping class group action on the flower algebra with bracket { , } Θ uniquely, and we see that it is given by the push-forward with ρ γ (P −1 γ • β). Since Γ and Γ are related by the commutative diagram (3.3) and ρ γ , ˜ ρ γ by (3.6), the mapping class group action on the flower algebra with bracket { , } is then given by push-forward with ρ γ (P −1 γ ). Recalling from Lemma 3.3 that the push-forwards with ρ γ (g) and ρ γ (g) define a Poisson action of the group G on the flower algebra with bracket { , } and { , } Θ , we obtain the following theorem.</p>

				<head n="4">The quantum action of the mapping class group</head>

				<p>In this section we investigate the action of the mapping class group on the quantised flower algebra and its representation spaces defined in Def. 2.3, Def. 2.4. For the case of Chern- Simons theory with compact, semisimple gauge groups the corresponding quantum action of the mapping class group has been studied by Alekseev and Schomerus [5], who claim that elements of the mapping class group act as algebra automorphism on the quantum algebra constructed via their formalism of combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory 3 . Furthermore, they relate this quantum action of the mapping class group to an action of a quantum group associated to the gauge group of the underlying Chern-Simons theory. In terms of this quantum group action, Dehn twists around embedded curves are given by the action of the ribbon element and the exchange of punctures is implemented via the universal R-matrix.</p>

				<p>We generalise and prove these results for semidirect product gauge groups of type G ⋉ g * .</p>

				<p>Using the fact that elements of the mapping class group act as Poisson isomorphisms on the classical flower algebra and the rather close relation between classical and quantised flower algebra, we prove that the mapping class group acts on the quantised flower algebra via algebra isomorphisms. We show that this mapping class group action on the quantised flower algebra can be implemented as an action on its representation spaces. Finally, we relate the mapping class group action to representations of a quantum group, which in our case is the quantum double D(G) of the group G.</p>

				<p>In the proof of Theorem 4.1. in [23], we demonstrated that any Poisson isomorphism of the flower algebra that maps the subspace g n+2g ⊗ C ∞ (G n+2g ) ⊕ C ∞ (G n+2g ) to itself gives rise to an algebra isomorphism of the quantised flower algebra (2.15).

				<p>) in the classical and quantised flower algebra, the quantum action on this subspace agrees with the classical action. Both the generators (A.4)-(A.10) of the pure mapping class group PMap(S g,n \D) and the generators (A.11) satisfy the condition above, so that the classical action of the mapping class group gives rise to a mapping class group action as algebra automorphisms of the quantised flower algebra. The results in Sect. 3 then allow us to implement this action on the representation spaces in Theorem 2.4. The key observation is that the states ψ ∈ V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn in the Hilbert spaces defined in Def. 2.4 are vector-valued functions on G n+2g satisfying an equivariance condition. Each component of ψ may thus be viewed as an element of the flower algebra with bracket { , } Θ . This allows us to define a representation of Map(S g,n \D) on the Hilbert spaces V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn by extending its action on the flower algebra componentwise to ψ ∈ V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn .</p>

				<p>which together with (4.4) proves the claim.</p>

				<p>We would now like to relate this action of the mapping class group on the Hilbert spaces V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn to different representations of a quantum group associated to the gauge group G ⋉ g * , generalising the corresponding result for compact, semisimple gauge groups obtained by Alekseev and Schomerus [5].

				<p>The quantum group relevant to our formulation is the quantum double D(G) of the group G. Using the definition given in [23], we can identify the quantum double as a vector space with the space of continuous functions on G × G with compact support: D(G) = C 0 (G × G, C). In order to exhibit the structure of D(G) as a ribbon-Hopf*-algebra , it is necessary to introduce Dirac delta functions which are not strictly in C 0 (G×G, C) but can be included by simply adjoining them. Thus we define multiplication •, identity 1, co-multiplication ∆, co-unit ǫ, antipode S and involution * via</p>

The universal R-matrix is then given by R(v 1 , u 1 ; v 2 , u 2 ) = δ e (v 1 )δ e (u 1 v −1 2 ) (4.7) and the central ribbon element c by c(v, u) = δ v (u). (4.8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We start by considering Dehn twists around embedded curves γ. In order to relate the action of these Dehn twists to the action of the ribbon element in representations of D(G), we need to find a way of associating such representations of D(G) to each of the curves γ. In view of the classical results in Sect. 3, one could expect these representations to involve the G-actioñ ρ γ and the map P γ : G n+2g → G. To pursue this intuition further, we note that, given an action of the group G on a manifold M together with map φ : M → G satisfying a certain compatibility condition, there is a canonical way of constructing representations of the quantum double D(G) on the space L 2 (M):</p>

				<figure>

					<figDesc>where dz is the Haar measure on G.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>Proof: That (4.10) defines a unitary representation of D(G) can be shown by direct calculation using the definition (4.6) of the quantum double D(G) and the compatibility condition (4.9).</p>

				<p>In our situation, we have M = G n+2g and consider the G-action ρ = ˜ ρ γ and the map φ = P −1 γ • β. We need to show that they satisfy (4.9). For the set of curves (A.1) in the appendix and the separating curves (3.15), this follows directly from identity (3.6) and expressions (3.16)-(3.22) and (3.25) for the G-actions. Identity (3.13) then allows us to generalise this result to all embedded curves on S g,n \D as follows. If ρ γ and P −1 γ • β satisfy (4.9) for an embedded curve γ and ξ is obtained from γ via the action of an element λ ∈ Map(S g,n \D) of the mapping class group, we have</p>

				<p>By Lemma 4.2, the G-actioñ ρ γ and the map P −1 γ • β then define a unitary representation of the quantum double D(G) on the Hilbert spaces V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn . Using expression (4.8) for the ribbon element, we see that its representation on the space V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn agrees with the action of the corresponding Dehn twist:</p>

				<head n="5">Concluding remarks</head>

				<p>In this paper we constructed a Poisson action of the mapping class group Map(S g,n \D) on the flower algebra and on the representation spaces of the associated quantum algebra. We related the classical action of Dehn twists to an infinitesimally generated G-action and, in the case where the exponential map is surjective, to Hamiltonian flows of certain conjugation invariant functions on G ⋉ g * . In the quantum theory, we showed how the mapping class group representation can be expressed in terms of the ribbon element and universal R-matrix of the quantum double D(G). Our results were derived for any connected, simply-connected and unimodular finite-dimensional Lie group G, but the assumptions of connectedness and unimodularity can be dropped at the expense of mild technical complications.</p>

				<p>We feel that the mathematical structure of the flower algebra makes it an object of investigation in its own right. However, it attracted our attention because of its relevance to physics, more precisely, its role in the description of the phase space of (2+1)-dimensional gravity in the Chern-Simons formulation. The phase space of Chern-Simons theory with gauge group G ⋉ g * , the moduli space of flat G ⋉ g * -connections, can be obtained from our set of holonomies M 1 , . . . , M n , A 1 , B 1 , . . . A g , B g by imposing the condition (2.6) and dividing by the G ⋉ g * -action which simultaneously conjugates all holonomies. Formal arguments, based on the analogy with the discussion in [5], suggest that the Poisson action of Map(S g,n \D) on the flower algebra descends to a symplectic action of Map(S g,n ) on the moduli space. A mathematically rigorous implementation of these arguments for the non-compact groups G ⋉ g * considered here would be interesting, particularly for the physically relevant cases where G ⋉ g * is the universal cover of the three-dimensional Euclidean or Poincaré group.</p>

				<p>In the quantum theory, the classical conjugation symmetry is replaced by an action of the quantum double D(G) on the Hilbert spaces V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn , see [22], in particular Eq. (4.27). The constraint (2.6) is then implemented on these Hilbert spaces by imposing invariance under the action of the quantum double. The action of Map(S g,n \D) on V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn derived in Sect. 4 of the present paper commutes with this action of the quantum double. Formally, one obtains an action of the mapping class group Map(S g,n ) on the invariant states in V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn , but there are again technical difficulties related to the non-compactness of G ⋉ g * : the states which are invariant under the D(G)-action are singular and not proper elements of V µ 1 s 1 ...µnsn . For the case of Chern-Simons theory with the non-compact but semisimple gauge group SL(2, C), a mathematically rigorous way of defining invariant states has been derived in [11]. It would be interesting to see if a similar method can be applied to our situation and to investigate the resulting mapping class group action on the reduced Hilbert space, again with particular attention to the three-dimensional Euclidean or Poincaré group.</p>

				<p>A Dehn twist around an embedded curve γ can be defined by embedding a small annulus around the curve and twisting its ends by an angle of 2π as shown in Fig. 4. It induces an outer automorphism of the fundamental group, affecting only those elements for which all representing curves intersect with γ. If we choose a representing curve that has the smallest possible number of intersections with γ for each of the generators m i , a j , b j of the fundamental group and determine their transformations by drawing the images of these curves as indicated in Fig. 4, we obtain explicit formulae for the action of the pure mapping class group on these generators.

				<p>A set of generators of the full mapping class group of the surface S g,n \D is obtained by supplementing this set of generators with the generators σ i , i = 1, . . . , n of the braid group. The action of these generators on the loops m i around the punctures is shown in Fig. 5. They leave invariant all generators of the fundamental group except m i and m i+1 , on which they act according to σ i :m i → m i+1</p>

				<head>A The generators of the mapping class group</head>

				<p>For the convenience of the reader we give a set of generators of the mapping class groups Map(S g,n ) and Map(S g,n \D) with explicit formulae for their actions on a set of generators of the fundamental groups π 1 (S g,n ) and π 1 (S g,n \D). Some of the contents of this appendix are taken from our discussion in [22].</p>

				<p>The pure mapping class group PMap(S g,n \D) of the punctured surface S g,n \D is the subgroup of Map(S g,n \D) which leaves each puncture fixed. A set of generators and defining relations has been derived by Birman [9, 10] but for us the set of generators used by Schomerus and Alekseev [5] is more convenient, which was first given in [24], see also [21]. Note that this set also generates PMap(S g,n ), with additional relations.</p>

				<p>The generating set consists of Dehn twists around the curves a i , δ i , α i , ǫ i , κ ν,µ , κ ν,n+2i−1 and κ ν,n+2i pictured in Fig. 3</p>
