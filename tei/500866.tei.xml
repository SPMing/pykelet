				<p>We derive the full Kaluza–Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS 5 ×T 11 with T 11 = SU (2) × SU (2) U (1). From the knowledge of the spectrum and general multiplet shortening conditions, we make a refined test of the AdS/CF T correspondence, by comparison between various shortenings of SU (2, 2|1) super-multiplets on AdS 5 and different families of boundary operators with protected dimensions. Additional towers of long multiplets with rational dimensions, that are not protected by supersymmetry, are also predicted from the supergravity analysis.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>One of the most fascinating properties of the AdS/CF T correspondence [1, 2, 3] is the deep relation between supergravity and gauge theory dynamics, at least in the regime where the supergravity approximation (small space–time curvature) is a reliable description of a more fundamental theory such as string or M theory [4, 5].</p>

				<p>Although many tests have been performed in the case of maximal supersymmetry, relating for instance, the dynamics of N coincident D3 branes (for large N) and type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS 5 × S 5 [4], much less is known on the dual theories for a lower number of supersymmetries [6], where the candidate models exhibit a far richer structure since they contain a variety of matter multiplets with additional symmetries other than the original R-symmetry dictated by the supersymmetry algebra [7]. A particularly interesting class of models are obtained by assuming that S 5 is replaced by a five–dimensional coset manifold X 5 = G/H with some Killing spinors. As shown in [8] there is a unique such manifold X 5 = T pq = SU(2) × SU(2) U(1) with p = q = 1, where p and q define the embedding of the H = U(1) group into the two SU(2) groups . The supergravity theory on AdS 5 × T 11 is an N = 2 supergravity theory with a matter gauge group G = SU(2) × SU(2). The corresponding four dimensional conformal field theory must then be [9] an N = 1 Yang–Mills theory with a flavour symmetry G such that an accurate test of the AdS/CF T correspondence could be made using the knowledge of the entire spectrum of the supergravity side of this theory. The conformal field theory description of IIB on AdS 5 × T 11 was constructed by Klebanov and Witten [9] and it was the first example of a conformal theory describing branes at conifold singularities. The same theory was later re–obtained by Morrison and Plesser [10] by adopting a general method of studying branes at singularities [11]. Infact, under certain conditions, a conical singularity in a Calabi–Yau space of complex dimension n can be described by a cone over an Einstein manifold X 2n−1 . In the case of X 5 = T 11 such construction gives rise to a conformal field theory with &quot; singleton &quot; [12] degrees of freedom A and B each a doublet of the factor groups SU(2) × SU(2) and with conformal anomalous dimension ∆ A,B = 3/4. Moreover the gauge group G is SU(N) × SU(N) and the two singleton (chiral) multiplets are respectively in the (N, N) and (N, N) of G. An infinite set of chiral operators of this theory which are the analogue of the Kaluza– Klein (KK) excitations of the N = 4 Yang–Mills theory with SU(N) gauge group is given by Tr(AB) k with R–charge k and in the (</p>

				</figure>

				<p>of this infinite family of chiral operators (massive N = 2 hypermultiplets in the supergravity language ) has been confirmed by Gubser [13] by a study of the eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian when performing harmonic analysis of IIB supergravity on AdS 5 ×T 11 .</p>

				<p>Moreover the matching of gravitational and R-symmetry anomalies in the two theories have been also proved in ref. [13]. This paper analyses the complete spectrum of the KK states on AdS 5 × T 11 and infers its multiplet structure as done in previous investigations for maximal supersymmetry.</p>

				<p>In that case the KK spectrum, analysed in terms of AdS representations in [14, 15], was interpreted in terms of N = 1 conformal superfields in [3] and in terms of the N = 4 one in [16] and [17]. The multiplet shortening conditions [18] can be inferred from the knowledge of all the mass matrices in the KK spectrum [19, 20]. In the case of the SU(2, 2|1) superalgebra, the shortening is proven to correspond to three types of shortening of the appropriate representations, as discussed in [21] and [22]: massless AdS multiplets, short AdS multiplets and semi–long AdS multiplets. These multiplets, in the conformal field theory language, correspond to respectively conserved, chiral and semi– conserved superfields which have all protected dimensions and which therefore correspond to very particular shortening conditions in the KK context.</p>

				<p>We show a full and detailed correspondence between all the CFT operators and the KK modes for the conformal operators of preserved scaling dimension. We also show that there exist other operators related to long multiplets but having non–renormalised conformal dimension. Interestingly enough, these operators seem to be the lowest dimensional ones for a given structure appearing in the supersymmetric Born–Infeld action of the D3–brane on AdS 5 × T 11 [23, 24, 25, 26].</p>

				<p>The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 the harmonic analysis of IIB supergravity on AdS 5 × T 11 is performed and the complete mass spectrum of the theory is exhibited. In sec. 3 properties of N = 1 four–dimensional supersymmetric field theories are recalled, in particular the superfield realisation of different short and long superconformal multiplets of the SU(2, 2|1) superalgebra. In sec. 4 a comparison of superfields of protected dimensions and states in the KK spectrum is made using the formulae giving the mass–conformal dimension relations as predicted by the AdS/CF T correspondence.</p>

				<p>In this section we give a summary of the derivation of the full mass spectrum of Type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS 5 × T 11 obtained by KK harmonic expansion on T 11 . Since our main goal here is the comparison of the mass spectrum with the composite operators of the CFT at the boundary of AdS 5 , we just sketch the general procedure and postpone a detailed derivation of our results to a forthcoming pubblication [27]. Partial results were obtained in [13, 28] using different methods.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>2.1 T 11 geometry Let us start with a short discussion of the T 11 geometry 5 . We consider two copies of SU(2) with generators T A , ˆ T A , (A = 1 . . . 3): [T A , T B ] = ǫ AB C T C , [ ˆ T A , ˆ T B ] = ǫ AB C ˆ T C . (2.1) We decompose the Lie algebra G of SU(2) × SU(2) with respect to the diagonal generator T H ≡ T 3 + ˆ T 3 , (2.2) as G = H + K, (2.3)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the sub–algebra H is made of the single generator T H and the coset algebra K contains the generators T i (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>i = 1, 2), ˆ T s (s = 1, 2), and T 5 = T 3 − ˆ T 3 . (2.4) In terms of this new basis the commutation relations are [T i , T j ] = 1 2 ǫ ij (T H + T 5 ), [ ˆ T s , ˆ T t ] = 1 2 ǫ st (T H − T 5 ), [T 5 , T i ] = [T H , T i ] = ǫ i j T j , [T 5 , ˆ T s ] = [T H , ˆ T s ] = ǫ s t ˆ T t , (2.5) [T i , ˆ T s ] = [T 5 , T H ] = 0. We introduce the coset representative L of SU(2) × SU(2) U H (1) , U H (1) being the diagonal subgroup of G generated by T H L(y i , y s , y 5 ) = exp T i y i · exp T s y s · exp T 5 y 5 , (2.6) and construct the left invariant form on the coset L −1 dL = ω i T i + ω s ˆ T s + ω 5 T 5 + ω H T H , (2.7) where the one–forms {ω i , ω s , ω 5 , ω H } satisfy the Maurer–Cartan equations dω Λ + 1 2 C Λ ΣΠ ω Σ ω Π = 0, Λ, Π, Σ ≡ {i, s, 5, H}. (2.8) The one–forms ω K ≡ {ω i , ω s , ω 5</trash>

				<p>} are K–valued and can be identified with the five vielbeins of G/H = T 11 , while ω H is H–valued and is called the H–connection of the coset manifold.</p>

				<p>It is convenient to rescale the ω K and define as vielbeins V</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>a ≡ (V i , V s , V 5 ): V i = a ω i , V s = b ω s , V 5 = c ω 5 , (2.9)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where a, b, c are real rescaling factors which will be determined by requiring that T 11 is an Einstein space [29, 30]. Once we have the vielbeins, we may construct the Riemann connection one–form B ab ≡ −B ba (a, b = i, s, 5), imposing the torsion–free condition</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>dV a − B ab V b = 0. (2.10) By comparison with the M.C.E.&apos;s (2.8), one finds B ij = −ǫ ij ω + c − a 2 4c V 5 , B 5i = a 2 4c ǫ ij V j , B st = −ǫ st ω − c − b 2 4c V 5 , B 5s = − b 2 4c ǫ st V t . B is = 0. (2.11) Consequently, the curvature two–form, defined as R ab ≡ dB ab − B a c B cb , (2.12) turns out to be R ij = a 2 − 3 16 a 4 c 2 V i V j + a 2 b 2 16c 2 ǫ ij ǫ st V s V t , R st = b 2 − 3 16 b 4 c 2 V s V t + a 2 b 2 16c 2 ǫ st ǫ ij V i V j , R is = a 2 b 2 16c 2 ǫ ij ǫ st V j V t , (2.13) R i5 = a 4 16c 2 V i V 5 , R s5 = a 4 16c 2 V s V 5 . The Ricci tensors are now easily computed. We find R i k = 1 2 a 2 − a 4 16c 2 δ i k , R s t = 1 2 b 2 − b 4 16c 2 δ s t , R 5 5 = a 4 8c 2 . (2.14) In order to have an Einstein space with Ricci tensor R a b = 2 e 2 δ a b , (2.15) we must have a 2 = b 2 = 6e 2 , and c 2 = 9 4 e 2 . (2.16) 2.2 Harmonic calculus</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>An essential tool for the computation of the Laplace–Beltrami invariant operators on T 11 is the evaluation of the covariant derivative D ≡ (D i , D s , D 5 ). Starting from the definition</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>D = d + B ab T ab ≡ d + B, (2.17) where T ab are the SO(5) generators written as matrices: (T ab ) cd = −δ cd ab , setting B = ω H + M, one can write D = D H + M, (2.18) where the H–covariant derivative is defined by D H = d + ω H (2.19) and the matrix of one–forms M can be computed from (2.11) M ij = − c − a 2 4c V 5 ǫ ij , M 5i = a 2 4c ǫ ij V j , M st = c − a 2 4c V 5 ǫ st , M 5s = − a 2 4c ǫ st V t , (2.20) M is = 0.</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The usefulness of the decomposition (2.18), (2.19), (2.20) lies in the fact that the action of D H on the basic harmonic represented by the T 11 coset representative L −1 can be computed algebraically. Indeed one has quite generally [30, 31] D H = −r(a)T a V a ≡ −a(T i V i + ˆ T s V s ) − cT 5 V 5 , (2.21) where r(i) = r(s) = a, r(5) = c are the rescalings and T a are the coset generators of T 11 .</p>

				<p>In summary, the covariant derivative on the basic harmonic L −1 can be written as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>follows DL −1 = (−r(a)T a V a + M ab T ab )L −1 , (2.22) or, in components, using (2.20), D i L −1 = −aT i − a 2 2c ǫ i j T 5j L −1 , D s L −1 = −aT s + a 2 2c ǫ s t T 5t L −1 , (2.23) D 5 L −1 = −cT 5 − 2 c − a 2 4c (T 12 − T 34 ) L −1 .</trash>

				<p>In a KK compactification, after the linearisation of the equations of motion of the field fluctuations, one is left with a differential equation on the ten–dimensional fields φ [Λ] [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] (x, y) (2 [Λ] x + [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] y )φ [Λ]</p>

				<p>AdS space and y is the kinetic operator for a field of spin [λ 1 , λ 2 ] in the internal space T 11 . (In the following we omit the index [Λ] on the fields).</p>

				<p>Expanding φ [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] (x, y) in the harmonics of T 11 transforming irreducibly under the isometry group of T 11 , one is reduced to the problem of computing the action of y on the harmonics, whose eigenvalues define the AdS mass. y is a Laplace–Beltrami operator on T 11 and it is constructed, for every representation [λ 1 , λ 2 ], in terms of the covariant derivative on G/H. Since the covariant derivative acts algebraically on the basic vector or spinor harmonic L −1 (in terms of which any harmonic can be constructed), the problem of the mass spectrum computation is reduced, via (2.22)–(2.23) to a purely algebraic problem. The explicit evaluation of the linearised equation (2.24) for the five–dimensional case has been given in [32] and we will adopt the same notations therein to denote the five– dimensional space–time fields appearing in the harmonic expansion. Note that (2.24) has been evaluated in [32] around the background solution presented in [8]:</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where the field F abcde and F mnpqr is the projection on T 11 and AdS 5 of the ten–dimensional five–form F defined as F = dA 4 , A 4 being the real self–dual four–form of type IIB supergravity. The other fields of type IIB supergravity are: the metric G M N (x, y) with internal and space–time components g αβ (y), g µν (x) whose Ricci tensors in this background are given in (2.25) and the complex 0–form and 2–form B and A M N (the fermionic fields ψ M and χ are obviously zero in the background (2.25)).</p>

				<head n="2.3">Harmonic expansion</head>

				<p>The harmonics on the coset space T 11 are labelled by two kinds of indices, the first labelling the particular representation of the isometry group SU(2) × SU(2) × U R (1) and the other referring to the representation of the subgroup H ≡ U H (1). The harmonic is thus denoted by Y</p>

				<p>(y) where j, l are the spin quantum numbers of the two SU(2) in a given representation, q is the U H (1) charge and r denotes the U R (1) quantum number associated to the generator T 5 orthogonal to T H . We can identify r as the R–symmetry quantum number [13, 28]. Now we observe that U H (1) is necessarily a subgroup of SO(5), the tangent group of T 11 . The embedding formula of U H (1) in a given representation of SO(5) labelled by indices Λ, Σ, is given by [30, 31] (T H )</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Λ Σ = C H ab (T ab ) Λ Σ , (2.26) where the structure constants C H ab are derived from the algebra (2.5) and T ab are the SO(5) generators. In the vector representation of SO(5) we find (T H ) ab = C Hab =    ǫ ij ǫ st 0    , (2.27) while for the spinor representation we get (T H ) = C H ab (T ab ) = − 1 4 C H ab (γ ab ) = − 1 2 (γ 12 + γ 34 ) = i      0 0 1 -1      , (2.28) where γ are the SO(5) gamma matrices. The above results imply that an SO(5) field φ [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] (x, y) can be splitted into the direct sum of U H (1) one–dimensional fragments labelled by the U H (1) charge q. From (2.27) and (2.28) it follows that the five–dimensional and four–dimensional SO(5) representations break under U H (1) as 5 → 1 ⊕ −1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ −1 ⊕ 0 [λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [1, 0], 4 → 1 ⊕ −1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 [λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [1/2, 1/2]. (2.29) From (2.29</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) we easily find the analogous breaking law for antisymmetric tensors ([λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [1, 1]), symmetric traceless tensors ([λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [2, 0]) and spin tensors ([λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [3/2, 1/2]) by taking suitable combinations:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>10 → ±1 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ ±2 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 [λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [1, 1], 16 → ±2 ⊕ ±2 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 [λ 1 , λ 2 ] = 3 2 , 1 2 , 14 → ±2 ⊕ ±2 ⊕ ±2 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ ±1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 [λ 1 , λ 2 ] = [2, 0]. (2.30)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Actually it is often more convenient to write down the harmonic expansion in terms of the SO(5) harmonics Y (j,l) [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] whose fragments are the Y (j,l,r) (q) introduced before. The generic field φ [λ 1 ,λ 2 ] (x, y) can be expanded in these harmonics as follows</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>φ ab... (x, y) = (ν) (m) φ (ν)(m) (x)Y (ν)(m) ab... (y), (2.31)</trash>

				<p>where a, b, . . . are SO(5) tensor (or spinor) indices of the representation [λ 1 , λ 2 ], (ν) is a shorthand notation for (j, l, r) and m labels the representation space of (j, l, r). In our case m coincides with the labelling of the U H (1) fragments. It is well known [30, 31] that the irrepses of SU(2) ×SU(2) appearing in the expansion (2.31) are only those which contain, when reduced with respect to U H (1), a charge q also appearing in the decomposition of [λ 1 , λ 2 ] under U H (1). It is easy to see which are the constraints on j, l, r selecting the allowed representations (ν) appearing in (2.31). We write a generic representation of SU</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(2) × SU(2) in the Young tableaux formalism: (j, l) ≡ . . . 2j ⊗ . . . 2l . (2.32) A particular component of (2.32) can be written as 1 . . . 1 m 1 2 . . . 2 m 2 ⊗ 1 . . . 1 n 1 2 . . . 2 n 2 (2.33) and we have 2j = m 1 + m 2 2j 3 = m 2 − m 1 , 2l = n 1 + n 2 2l 3 = n 2 − n 1 . (2.34) Furthermore (recalling the definitions (2.2)–(2.4)) we get T H Y (j,l,r) (q) = i q Y (j,l,r) (q) ≡ i (j 3 + l 3 ) Y (j,l,r) (q) , T 5 Y (j,l,r) (q) = i r Y (j,l,r) (q) ≡ i (j 3 − l 3 ) Y (j,l,r) (q) . (2.35) Hence 2j 3 = q + r ≡ m 2 − m 1 , 2l 3 = q − r ≡ n 2 − n 1 . (2.36)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Now we observe that as long as m 2 − m 1 and n 2 − n 1 are even or odd, the same is true for m 1 + m 2 and n 1 + n 2 . Therefore the parity of 2j and 2l is the same as that of 2j 3 and 2l 3 and since 2j 3 + 2l 3 = 2q can be even or odd, the same is true for 2j + 2l. It follows that j and l must either be both integers or both half–integers. This means that the q value of any U H (1) fragment of the SO(5) fields is always contained in any SO(5)–harmonic in the irrep (j, l) provided that j and l are both integers or half–integers. Since q + r and q − r are related to the third component of the &quot; angular momentum &quot; of the two SU(2) factors, one also has the conditions |q + r| ≤ 2j and |q −r| ≤ 2l. The two above conditions select the harmonics appearing in the expansion.</p>

				<p>In order to be specific it is now convenient to list all the five–dimensional space– time fields appearing in the harmonic expansion together with the corresponding ten– dimensional fields, with AdS 5 indices and/or internal indices, following the notations of [32] .

				<p>We give as a further example the action of the D / operator on the spinor representation of SO(5).</p>

				</figure>

				<p>When substituting the values of c and a in the matrix (2.50) we note that (2.16) defines them only up to a sign. The right choice is dictated by supersymmetry. Indeed, the existence of a complex Killing spinor η(y) generating N = 2 supersymmetry in AdS 5 implies that it must have the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>η =      k l 0 0      , k, l ∈ C (2.51) since, being an SU(2) × SU(2) singlet, it must satisfy T H η = 0 (see (2.28)). At this point the Killing equation D / η = 5 2 eη can be computed from (2.50) observing that on an SU(2) × SU(2) singlet the T a generators have a null action and thus, using (2.51), D / η =    a 2 4c + c σ 3 0 0 0    η = 5 2 e η. (2.52) This gives the correct value only if we choose l = 0 and c = − 3 2 e, (2.53) while the sign of a = ± √ 6 e is unessential. Recalling the meaning of c as the rescaling of the vielbein V 5 , we conclude that T 11 admits a Killing spinor, leading to N = 2 supersymmetry on AdS 5 , only for one orientation of T 11 . To compute the mass matrix, we write (2.50) as an explicit 4 × 4 matrix D / = e             −i 3 2 T 5 + 5 2 0 √ 6 ˆ T + √ 6T − 0 −i 3 2 T 5 − 5 2 √ 6T + − √ 6 ˆ T − − √ 6 ˆ T − − √ 6T − 3 2 iT 5 0 − √ 6T + √ 6 ˆ T + 0 3 2 iT 5             , (2.54) where we have set T ± ≡ T 1 ± iT 2 , ˆ T ± ≡ ˆ T 1 ± i ˆ T 2 .

				<p>Since the harmonics are really defined up to a constant, the operatorial matrix (2.54) can be replaced by a numerical one, simply obtained by substituting in each entry the values of the T –operators on the harmonics. By diagonalization of this matrix one gets the eigenvalues which are related to the fermion masses by numerical shifts. Analogous procedure can be used for all the other invariant operators. In general the matrices can become very large depending on the number of U H (1) fragments in the decomposition of [λ 1 , λ 2 ]. Leaving further explanations and all the details to the forthcoming paper [27], we now quote the results for the mass spectrum.</p>

				<p>However, we know a priori how many states we obtain in these two cases, and by a counting argument we can circumvent the problem of the explicit computation of the eigenvalues of their mass matrices. For the vector–spinors we have in principle a matrix of rank 20, that becomes 16 × 16 due to the irreducibility condition, and further gets to 12 × 12, once the transversality condition D a Ξ a = 0 is imposed. In this way we are left with 12 non–trivial (non longitudinal) eigenvalues and thus we expect 12 ψ (T ) spinors. In an analogous way, the traceless symmetric tensor Y</p>

				<p>SU(2, 2|1), the remaining degrees of freedom of ψ (T ) and φ are uniquely assigned to the supermultiplets for their completion.</p>

				<p>In tables 2–10 we have arranged our results in SU(2, 2|1) supermultiplets by an exaustion principle, starting from the highest spin of the supermultiplet. Each state of such multiplets is labelled by the SU(2, 2) quantum numbers (E 0 , s 1 , s 2 ) other than the internal symmetry attributes (j, l, r). As explained in section 3, E 0 , the AdS energy, is identified with the conformal dimension ∆. Taking into account the E 0 value of each state and its R–symmetry, we are able to fit unambiguously every mass at the proper place. For this purpose it is essential to use the relations between the conformal weights ∆ and the masses given by</p>

				<p>We have found nine families of supermultiplets: one graviton multiplet, four gravitino multiplets and four vector multiplets which are reported in tables 2–10. These are organised as follows.</p>

				<p>In the first column we give the (s 1 , s 2 ) spin quantum numbers of the state.</p>

				<p>In the second column we give the E 0 value of the state, where, according to the standard nomenclature, the value of E 0 is referred to as the E 0 of the multiplet and belongs to a vector field, a spin 1/2 field or to a scalar field for the graviton, gravitino and vector multiplets respectively. The other states have an E 0 value shifted in a range of ±2 (in 1/2 steps) with respect to the E 0 of the multiplet.</p>

				<p>In the third column we write the R–symmetry of the state where the value r is assigned to the highest spin state (r = r h.s. ), the other states having R–symmetry shifted in a range of ±2 (in integer steps).</p>

				<p>In the fourth column we give the right association of that particular SU(2, 2|1) state to the field obtained from the KK spectrum, according to the notations explained above.</p>

				<p>In the fifth column we give the mass of the state 7 in terms of the ubiquitous expression H 0 , where H 0 is evaluated at a value r corresponding to that R–symmetry of the multiplet defined as the R–symmetry of the highest spin r = r h.s. . We note that in all the formulae giving the mass spectrum (2.55)–(2.63), the R–symmetry r refers to the particular state we are considering. There, H 0 appears to have dependence on the r of the state which is different for different states. However, when arranging the states in supermultiplets of SU(2, 2|1), it is convenient to express the r of the state in terms of the R–symmetry of the supermultiplet r = r h.s. , defined as the R–symmetry of the highest spin. In this case, all the masses can be expressed in terms of an H 0 which has the same dependence on r = r h.s. for all the members of the multiplet. For the graviton multiplet and the first two families of vector multiplets all the masses are written in terms of H 0 ≡ H 0 (r); for the (left) gravitino multiplets all the masses are given in terms of H ± 0 ≡ H 0 (j, l, r ± 1) and for the last two families of vectors all the masses are given in terms of H ±± 0 ≡ H 0 (j, l, r ± 2). Indeed, if we compute the conformal weight ∆ of the state from the mass values, it turns out to be expressed in terms of H 0 , H</p>

					<trash>± 0 , H ±± 0 can be computed from (2.64</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) and we have given for each multiplet the conformal weight of the lowest state labelled by E 0 in terms of H 0 . The multiplets of Tables 2–10 are long multiplets of SU(2, 2|1) when the SU(2)×SU(2) quantum numbers j, l and the R–symmetry values are generic. However, it is well known from group theory [5, 22] that shortening of the multiplets can occur in correspondence with particular values of the SU(2, 2|1) quantum numbers giving rise to chiral (•), semi– long (⋆) or massless (⋄) multiplets. The above symbols have been used in the colums at the left of the tables to denote the surviving states in the shortened multiplets. In particular, the absence of these symbols in table 4 means that no shortening of any kind can occur for the gravitino multiplet II. Notice that shortenings are indicated only for positive values of the (shifted) R–symmetry r, namely when r satisfies the following inequalities (see section 4)</p>

				<p>In fact, these shortened multiplets are the most interesting in light of the correspondence with the CFT at the boundary.

				<p>It is crucial in our discussion to classify states corresponding to short multiplets because in this case the conformal dimension ∆ is protected and it allows a stringent test between the supergravity theory and the conformal field theory realisation. Here, protected means that ∆ is related to the R–charge which is quantised in terms of the isometry generator of U R (1). However, we note that unlike the N = 4 theory [24, 36], operators with protected dimensions have conformal dimension different from their free–field value. N = 1 superfields with protected and unprotected dimensions have been discussed by many authors [3, 5, 22, 37]. We would like to remind here just their field theory realisation, which will become especially important in comparing conformal operators with the particular model described by the IIB theory compactified on AdS 5 × T 11 .</p>

				<p>A generic conformal primary superfield is classified by an SL(2, C) (s 1 , s 2 ) representation , a dimension E 0 and an R–symmetry charge r. These are the quantum numbers of the ϑ = 0 component of the superfield.

				</figure>

				<p>In the AdS/CF T correspondence all these superfields correspond to KK states with multiplet shortening and typically they occur when there is a lowering in the rank of the mass matrix and rational values of E 0 are obtained. Conserved current multiplets correspond to massless fields in AdS 5 . They can only occur for fields whose mass is protected by a symmetry (such as gauge fields) and there is only a finite number of them corresponding to the gauge fields of the SU(2, 2|1) × SU(2) × SU(2) algebra and possibly Betti multiplets [38, 39]. While the massless vectors of the isometry group correspond to the U R (1) and flavour symmetry of the boundary gauge theory, the Betti multiplet, as recently shown by Klebanov and Witten [33], corresponds to the U b (1) baryonic current multiplet of the boundary CFT. There are also two complex moduli related to B and A ab wrapped on a 2–cycle of T 11 [9], giving two hypermultiplets with E 0 = 3 and r = 2.</p>

				<p>Massive KK states with arbitrary irrational value of E 0 correspond to generic conformal field operators with anomalous dimension.

However we will see that a peculiar phenomenon of N = 1 which can be learned from the AdS/CF T correspondence is that there exist also infinite towers of long multiplets with rational dimensions which in principle are not expected to have protected dimensions . A typical tower which is not expected to have protected dimension is the massive tower Q k = T</p>

The reason is that such superfield correspond to non–unitary modules.</p>

				<head n="4">AdS/CFT correspondence</head>

				<p>In section 2 and 3 we have described the KK spectrum with its multiplet structure and the CFT operators with protected dimensions. We would like now to present the multiplet shortening conditions and analyse the correspondence of these states with the boundary field theory operators shown in the last section. This is an important non–trivial check for the AdS/CF T correspondence. On the other hand, supergravity seems to suggest additional dynamical inputs to the extent that it predicts that certain towers of long multiplets have rational dimensions, suggesting the presence of some hidden symmetry. This latter may perhaps be explained in the context of Born–Infeld theory which relates D–brane dynamics to AdS supergravity in the large N limit. From the point of view of the SU(2, 2|1) multiplet structure, the shortening conditions correspond to saturation of some of the inequalities describing the unitarity bounds [22]. These become relations between E 0 and the other SU(2, 2|1) quantum numbers.</p>

				<p>In the KK context, we do not know a priori the multiplet structure of the KK states and the shortening conditions merely derive from the disappearance of some harmonics in the field expansion. This reduces the rank of the mass matrices and thus some of the states drop from the multiplet. The relevant fact is that these shortening conditions must be in one to one correspondence with those deriving from the SU(2, 2|1) group theoretical analysis. As discussed in the previous section, the shortening conditions can be read as the following relations on the SU(2, 2|1) quantum numbers already given in section (</p>

				</figure>

				<p>This means that the corresponding conformal dimension must have a rational value. As it can easily be seen from the mass spectrum presented in section two, this implies that only for specific G quantum numbers we can retrieve such short multiplets. Actually, a rational scaling dimension can be found only if H 0 (j, l, r) + 4 is a perfect square of a rational number. Two possible sets of values for which such a condition is satisfied are:</p>

				<p><formula>j = l = r 2 = k 2 (4.4) j = l − 1 = r 2 = k 2 or l = j − 1 = r 2 = k 2 (4.5)</formula></p>

				<p>We will also examine briefly the case</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>j = l = r − 2 2 r ≥ 2, (4.6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which for most multiplets leads to a violation of inequality (3.2), but in one case gives a consistent shortening of the vector multiplet III. We will show that these three cases are the relevant ones. Indeed, in the first case H 0 (j, l, r) = 9 4 r 2 +6|r| and thus H 0 (j, l,</p>

				<p><formula>r)+4 = 3 r 2 + 2 2</formula></p>

				<p>, in the second H 0 (j, l, r) = 9 4 r 2 + 12|r| + 12 and thus H 0 (j, l,</p>

				<p><formula>r) + 4 = 3 r 2 + 4 2</formula></p>

				<p>, while in the third case we have H 0 (j, l, r) = 9 4 r 2 −6r and thus H 0 (j, l,</p>

				<p><formula>r)+4 = 3 r 2 − 2 2 .</formula></p>

				<p>Of course there are other possible solutions, but we will see that only those presented above correspond to multiplet shortening.</p>

				<p>Looking at the tables 2–10 we see that for the graviton and type I and II vector multiplets (V.M.) E 0 is given in terms of H 0 (j, l, r) while for gravitino multiplet of type I, IV and II, III E 0 is given in terms of H ∓ 0 ≡ H 0 (j, l, r ∓ 1) respectively. Analogously, for the type III and IV V.M., E 0 is given in terms of H ±± 0 ≡ H 0 (j, l, r ± 2) respectively. As a consequence the conditions for rational values of E 0 (protected dimensions) are different for different multiplets. Let us examine the conditions (4.4),(4.5) and (4.6) separately.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>Using (4.1)–(4.3) we see that under condition (4.4) we obtain: • a chiral tensor multiplet from type I L.H. gravitino (4.15) (or an antichiral one from type III R.H. gravitino); • one hypermultiplet (for both signs of r) from type I V.M (4.19), and another hypermultiplet from type IV V.M. (4.22) (or from type III V.M if r &lt; −2) ; • a semilong graviton multiplet from (4.14) (for both signs of r); two semilong gravitino from type III and IV (or from type I if r &lt; 1 and type II if r &lt; −1 respectively), and IV R.H. gravitino multiplets from the two equations (4.17) and (4.18).</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>• For k = 0 (G–singlet), we also obtain from (4.14) a short massless graviton multiplet with E 0 = 3, r = 0. In this case only four states survive: the massless graviton, two massless gravitini (with r = ±1 depending on the chirality), and one massless vector. This latter, being an SU(2) × SU(2) × U R (1) singlet, must be identified with the R–symmetry Killing vector.</p>

				<p>Note that (4.16), (4.20) and (4.21) do not correspond to any shortening condition, yet we have a rational value of E 0 belonging to a long multiplet. It is now easy to find the correspondence between the supermultiplets obeying condition (4.7)–(4.13) and the primary conformal superfields on the CFT side discussed in the previous section. Given the values of E 0 and k (or r) we have immediately that the two hypermultiplets from (4.19) and (4.22) are in correspondence with the chiral superfields S k and Φ k (3.19) and (3.21); the tensor multiplet from (4.15) corresponds to the chiral superfield T k of (3.20); the semilong graviton multiplet from (4.14), associated with the semi–conserved superfield J k α ˙ α of (3.24) (in particular the massless graviton multiplet (k = 0 in (4.14)) corresponds to the conserved superfield J 0 α ˙ α ); finally, the two semilong gravitino multiplets from (4.17) and (4.18) can be put in correspondence with the semi–conserved superfields L</p>

				<p>We note that the type I vector series in Table 7 for j = l = r = 0, see (4.19), degenerates into the identity representation, since E 0 = 0. However, as follows from the same table, another unitary representation, a massless vector multiplet, appears in the spectrum. Indeed, for j = l = r = 0, the multiplet bosonic mass squared eigenvalues are m</p>

If we choose the E 0 = 0 branch, the other modes (scalars with E 0 = 1, 2 and vector with E 0 = 1) are gauge modes and decouple from the physical Hilbert space, thus the multiplet is a gauge module [44]. If we choose the E 0 = 4 branch, we get a unitary representation with a scalar with E 0 = 2 and a vector with E 0 = 3 as physical states, while the other modes (scalars with E 0 = 3, 4) decouple from the physical Hilbert space. This massless vector multiplet is the so called Betti multiplet of KK supergravity, related to the fact that a (p+1)–form (in this case p = 3) couples to a p–brane wrapped on a non–trivial p–cycle which in this case is related to b 3 = 1, the third Betti number of T 11 [33, 45]. The general occurrence of such Betti multiplets in the KK context was widely discussed in [38]. In the case of AdS 4 ×M 111 , such a multiplet is related to b 2 = 1 [39, 46], corresponding to the M–theory three–form with one component on AdS 4 and two components on M 111 and it was found in the KK context in [20]. Incidentally, in the language of [47], the Betti massless vector (D(3, 1/2, 1/2) ) is a zero center module 11 of the conformal group SU(2, 2), since all the Casimir vanish C I = C II = C III = 0 as is the case for the identity D(0, 0, 0),the gauge module D(1, 1/2, 1/2), the massless scalars D(4, 0, 0) appearing in the hypermultiplet S k for k = 0 (3.19) and the spin one singleton</p>

				<p>Beside shortened multiplets, there are CFT superconformal operators with rational dimensions that are associated with the long multiplets of (4.16),(4.20) and (4.21). Indeed we may construct the following superfields 12 all in the (</p>

				<p>where we have limited ourselves to the positive branch of the expressions in the absolute values appearing in (4.28)–(4.33).

Furthermore we have long multiplets from (4.34), (4.36), (4.37), (4.38), (4.40),(4.41) corresponding respectively to the following superconformal fields with rational dimensions C k = T r Ae V ¯ Ae −V J α ˙ α (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 5, r = k, (4.43) D k = T r W α e V ¯ W 2 e −V Ae V ¯ Ae −V (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 13 2 , r = k − 1, (4.44) E k = T r W 2 e V ¯ W 2 e −V Ae V ¯ Ae −V (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 8, r = k, (4.45) F k = T r e V ¯ W 2 e −V Ae V ¯ Ae −V (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 5, r = k − 2, (4.46) G k = T r e V ¯ W ˙ α e −V Ae V ¯ Ae −V (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 7 2 , r = k − 1, (4.47) H k = T r e V ¯ W ˙ α e −V W 2 Ae V ¯ Ae −V (AB) k , E 0 = 3 2 k + 13 2 , r = k + 1.

				</figure>

				<p>Inspection of the above list shows that these families are the lowest dimensional operators of a given structure, with building blocks given by W α , A, ¯ A, B and ¯ B. It should also be stressed that, although these operators have given quantum numbers of SU(2) × SU(2), and of SU(2, 2|1) E 0 , s 1 , s 2 , r, we have not discussed the most general form of these operators due to further mixing in terms of the constituent singleton fields W α , A, B. For instance, we have not written terms involving D α A or D α B, which certainly occur in the completion of some of the above operators (For example the ones including J</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Finally, we analyse the (4.6) condition. In this case the only multiplet which does not violate the (3.2) inequality is the type III vector multiplet, for which we get E 0 = 3 2 r + 2. This apparently could be interpreted as shortening to a semilong vector multiplet. However, the states of such multiplet do not appear in the KK expansion, while the states which are complementary to them form a chiral hypermultiplet which is allowed by the KK analisys 13 . Its lowest state is the φ field with E</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(s) 0 = E 0 + 1 = 3 2 r (s</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) , which is indeed the group theoretical condition for the shortening to a chiral multiplet of the type given in (3.19). The k = 0 (r s = 2) chiral multiplet has as last component a complex massless scalar related to the A ab 2–form wrapped on the non–trivial 2–cycle of T 11 , giving a second complex modulus other than the dilaton B for type IIB on AdS 5 × T 11 . Note that there is another massless scalar in the serie S k (3.19)for k = 2. This corresponds to the spin j = l = 1 in the harmonic expansion in the internal metric h ab .</p>

				<p>We would also like to remark that there are many more operators in the gauge theory which do not correspond to any supergravity KK mode, even though these multiplets may have spin less than two. A typical example is the Konishi (massive vector) superfield [50]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>K = T r(Ae V ¯ Ae −V ) + T r(Be V ¯ Be −V ) (4.49)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>with r = 0 and in the G–singlet j = l = 0. This superfield has anomalous dimension [42]. However, inspection of the supergravity spectrum, shows that the multiplets with j = l = r = 0 must have rational dimension and indeed they were identified with Q k=0 in (3.46) with E 0 = 6 and the Betti multiplet U in (4.23) with E 0 = 2. This state of affair is resolved by the fact that K is expected to have a divergent dimension ∆ in the large N–limit, as presumably happens in the N = 4 theory so that it should correspond to a string state. The Konishi multiplet [50] is a long multiplet whose ¯ D 2 is a chiral superfield which is a linear combination of the superpotential W = ǫ ij ǫ kl T r(A i B k A j B l ) and T r(W α W α ).</p>

				<p>This implies that neither W nor T r(W α W α ) are chiral primaries but rather a combination orthogonal to ¯ D ¯ DK. It is the latter superfield which appears in the supergravity spectrum and coincides with the chiral dilaton multiplet Φ k with k = 0. This is an example of operator mixing alluded before. Finally we observe that the knowledge of the flavour and R–symmetry anomalies in the gauge theory allow one to completely fix the low energy effective action of Type IIB supergravity on AdS 5 × T 11 at least in the sector of the massless vector multiplets [5]. In fact this relies on the computation of the bulk Chern–Simons term of the several gauge factors involved [51]</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Because of the AdS/CF T correspondence, the gauge variation of such Chern–Simons terms must precisely match, at least in leading order in N, the current anomalies of the boundary gauge theory [3, 5, 52, 13, 53]. Moreover the mixed gravitational gauge</p>

					<figDesc>(where Λ here runs only over the U(1) factors of the bulk gauge fields) should be non– leading since they are related to string corrections in the AdS/CF T correspondence [53]</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>. Because of the particular matter content of the model [9], all coefficients are in principle proportional to N 2 and thus leading in the AdS/CF T duality.</p>

				<p>So it is crucial that c Λ = 0, i.e. that U R (1), U b (1) are traceless[13]. The only non– vanishing d ΛΣ∆ coefficients are d rAA = d rBB , d bAA = −d bBB , d rrr , d rbb (4.52) and thus they determine (up to two derivatives) the low energy effective action.</p>

				<p>Consider AdS 5 × T 11 . We call M, N the curved ten–dimensional indices, µ, ν/m, n the curved/flat AdS 5 ones and αβ/a, b the curved/flat T 11 ones. In the four dimensional CFT α, . . . and ˙ α, . . . are spinorial indices. Our ten–dimensional metric is the mostly minus η = {+ − . . . −}, so that the internal space has a negative definite metric. For ease of construction, we have also used a negative metric to raise and lower the SU(2) × SU(2) Lie–algebra indices. Furthermore, for the SU(2) algebras we have defined ǫ 123 = ǫ 12 = 1.</p>

			<note place="foot" n="13"> Physically, the exclusion of the semilong multiplet can also be seen by the fact that it would contain an additional massless vector for j = l = r = 0 which do not correspond to any symmetry besides the isometry and barion symmetry.</note>
