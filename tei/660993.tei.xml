				<p>PACS numbers: 11.30.Hv; 12.60.Jv; 14.60.Fg. [ December 23, 2013 and hep-ph/0410044 ] I. INTRODUCTION</p>

				<p>Lepton flavor violation (LFV) for charged leptons is clear evidence to indicate physics beyond the standard model. A type of models based on supersymmetry (SUSY) naturally induces LFV couplings at loop levels due to the slepton mixing [1, 2]. The predicted branching ratios of LFV processes in SUSY models are only a few orders of magnitude smaller than the present experimental limits, and therefore they could be reached by future experiments. Various LFV processes can be experimentally searched. For the electron-muon sector, rare muon decay processes such as µ → eγ and µ → eee as well as µ − e conversion in a muonic atom have been studied and will be further examined by forthcoming experiments [3].</p>

				<p>In SUSY models, there are two types of LFV couplings: namely those mediated by the neutral gauge bosons and those by the neutral Higgs bosons. In particular , the Higgs-mediated LFV couplings attract much interest recently, because their contributions do not decouple even if the soft SUSY breaking scale is as large as O(1) TeV [4, 5, 6, 7]. It is in contrast to the case of the gauge boson mediation. Since the Higgs-mediated LFV couplings are proportional to the mass of the relevant charged leptons, the tau-associated processes are useful to study them. In recent years, the LFV couplings associated with a tau lepton have been measured at B factories [8, 9, 10] by searches for rare tau decays, such as τ → µγ, τ → 3µ, τ → µππ, τ → µη, etc. Direct searches for the Higgs LFV coupling via decays of the Higgs bosons (Φ 0 ), Φ 0 → τ ± µ ∓ , have been proposed by several authors, either at CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [11] or at a Linear Collider (LC) [12].</p>

				<p>In this letter, we would like to discuss an alternative approach of searching for the LFV couplings associated with a tau lepton by a µN → τ X reaction at the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) region with high-intensity and high-energy muon beams. Here, N is a target nucleon, and X represents all final state particles. Recently, Sher and Turan have discussed this process in a model independent approach [13]. Instead, we here study this process in the framework of SUSY, and evaluate the cross section under the current experimental constraints from the other LFV limits.</p>

				<p>The µ − τ transition processes have been estimated by the effective LFV couplings. The upper limits on the four-Fermi LFV couplings have been studied without assuming specific theoretical models in Ref. [14]. When the scalar LFV coupling is independent of the other types of couplings, its experimental constraint only comes from the process in which a tau decays into a muon and a pion pair (τ → µππ). The total cross section of the process µN → τ X mediated by the scalar LFV coupling could then be as large as 0.5 fb at muon energy (E µ ) of 50 GeV [13]. For this case, with 10 20 muons per year on a O(10 2 ) g/cm 2 target mass, about 10 6 of the µN → τ X events can be produced, or no observation of the µN → τ X signal would improve the limits by six orders of magnitude [13]. However, in SUSY models, the effective scalar coupling which is mediated by the CP-even Higgs bosons (h 0 and H 0 ) is correlated with the pseudo-scalar coupling which is mediated by the CPodd Higgs boson (A 0 ). Therefore, the constraint on the pseudo-scalar coupling from the τ → µη result [8] must be applied to the scalar coupling [15]. Consequently, the predicted µN → τ X cross section would become smaller than that in Ref. [13].</p>

				<p>The µN → τ X cross section is known to increase as E µ becomes high. When E µ is high enough, for instance more than several GeV, the DIS reaction dominates . Therefore, we calculate the µN → τ X cross section at the DIS region by using the realistic parton distribution function (PDF), and in particular estimate the contributions from different quarks separately. In SUSY models, the contributions from the down-type quarks are important for the Higgs-mediated LFV interaction for the region of large tan β, where tan β is the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values. Since the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs bosons with quarks are proportional to the mass of the associated quarks, the contribution of the dquark is not large, although its PDF contribution is large. For E µ of a few GeV, the contribuion from the s-quark sub-process, µs → τ s, dominates. We find that at energies higher than about 50 GeV, the contribution from the b-quarks arising from the gluon splitting becomes important . Therefore, at E µ = 100 GeV the cross section of µN → τ X can be one order of magnitude greater than that at E µ = 50 GeV. This paper is organized as follows. In the following section, we describe the LFV interaction in the minimum supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), and calculate the maximally allowed µN → τ X cross sections at the DIS region with experimental constraints. In the subsequent section, the µN → τ X phenomenology, in particular that for the signal and background, is discussed.</p>

In the following, the cross section of the µN → τ X reaction is calculated separately for the cases of the Higgs boson mediation and the gauge boson mediation, since the SUSY parameter regions where each of them is enhanced are different.</p>

				<p>First, let us start with the Higgs boson mediation. It is known that this type of effect does not decouple even in the large m SUSY limit, where m SUSY is a typical scale of the soft SUSY breaking [4, 5, 6]. The contribution of the Higgs boson mediation to the differential cross section</p>

				<p>R ) can be selectively studied by using purely left-handed (right-handed) incident muons. In SUSY models such as the MSSM with heavy right-handed neutrinos, LFV is radiatively induced due to the left-handed slepton mixing, which only affects C hH L and C A L . Therefore, in the following , we focus only on those C hH L and C A L couplings 1 . The magnitudes of the effective couplings are constrained by the current experimental results of searches for LFV processes of tau decays. In the case that all the effective couplings are independent, the constraints for the vector, axial-vector, scalar, and pseudo-scalar couplings are given in Ref. [14]. In the MSSM, however, the couplings are related each other. In particular, in the decoupling region (m A 150 GeV), the scalar coupling C hH L is nearly equal to the pseudo-scalar coupling C A L , since m H ≃ m A and sin(α − β) ≃ −1, where α is the mixing angle for the CP-even Higgs bosons. Therefore , both couplings are determined by the one that is more constrained, namely the pseudo-scalar coupling. It is constrained by the τ → µη decay (Br(τ → µη) &lt; 3.4 × 10 −7 ) [8].

				<p>, the contribution from the tensor interaction is found to be smaller than that from the Higgs boson mediation by about five orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the vector and axialvector interactions are suppressed at the same level as the pseudo-scalar interaction [14]. Therefore, their contributions can be as large as those for the Higgs boson mediation , if E µ is less than than 50 GeV [13]. For instance, the cross section from the vector (or axial vector) interaction can be of the order of 10 −4 fb for E µ = 50 GeV. At higher energies, the cross section for the gauge boson mediation are much smaller than those for the Higgs boson mediation because of no enhancement by the b-quark sub-process. It is concluded that the DIS process µN → τ X can be more useful to search the Higgs mediated LFV interaction in the MSSM for higher energy muon beams.</p>

				<p>III. THE µN → τ X PHENOMENOLOGY With the intensity of 10 20 muons per year and the target mass of 100 g/cm 2 , about 10 4 (10 2 ) events could be expected for σ(µN → τ X) = 10 −3 (10 −5 ) fb, which corresponds to E µ = 300 (50) GeV from Fig. 1. This would provide good potential to improve the sensitivity by four (two) orders of magnitude from the present limit from τ → µη decay, respectively. Such a muon intensity could be available at a future muon collider (MC) [18] and a neutrino factory (NF) [19]. We have studied the signal events of the µN → τ X reaction . In the Higgs boson mediated interaction, the tau leptons in the µN → τ X reaction are emitted at a relatively large angle with respect to the beam direction.</p>

It is assumed that the initial muons are purely left-handed.</p>

				<p>It is in contrast to the gauge mediated interaction where the tau leptons are forward-peaked. The differential cross section is given as a function of the tau energy (E τ ) and the tau emitted angle (θ) from the beam direction by</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Fig. 2, the E τ dependence in the differential cross section is shown for each θ at E µ =50 GeV and E µ =100 GeV. For E µ = 50 GeV, there are two peaks for each emission angle θ of the tau leptons. The peak at lower E τ for each curve corresponds to the contribution from the s-quark sub-process, and the other does to the b-quark contribution . The tau leptons from the b-quark sub-process are emitted with larger emission angles with relatively low energies, while those from the s-quark contribution carry higher energies with smaller emission angles. For E µ = 100 GeV, the contribution from the b-quark subprocess is dominant. The tau leptons are emitted with large angles around θ = 0.16.</p>

				<p>To identify the tau lepton from the µN → τ X reaction , direct measurement of tau lepton tracks (such as by emulsions) might not be possible at such a high beam rate. Instead, the identification might be possible by tagging the tau decay products and observing their decay kinematics. Among various decay modes, one might consider leptonic decays of the tau leptons as discussed in Ref. [20]. Another candidate could be to detect a hadron from the two-body tau decays. The branching ratios, such as τ → ν τ π, ν τ ρ and ν τ a 1 , are about 0.3 in total. In SUSY models with left-handed slepton mixing , the τ − (τ + ) produced through the Higgs-mediated interaction is only right-handed (left-handed) for an incident left-handed µ − beam (right-handed µ + beam). The hadrons from the right-handed τ − decay (left-handed τ + decay) tend to be emitted in the direction of the parent tau lepton, and therefore be rather energetic [21]. At the same time, the neutrino from the tau decay would carry a part of the energy of the tau lepton, resulting in missing energy. Therefore, the signature of the events could be a hard hadron from decay of the tau lepton produced at a relatively large angle from the beam direction (namely a hadron with large transverse momentum p T ) and some missing energy. Those hadrons from the tau decay should be discriminated from the hadrons from the target nucleons which have mostly soft energies. Discrimination of pions from muons could be the most critical issue, since a muon from the DIS process µN → µX would mimic the signal if it is misidentified as a pion. Therefore, they should be rejected with high efficiency . The rate of the DIS process µN → µX is very high, of the order of O(1) µb in total. Since the muon from µN → µX is very forward peaked, elimination of forward-going particles would give rejection in addition to the particle identification with a cost of the signal acceptance . The rejection of muons and the acceptance of hadrons from the tau leptons in µN → τ X might be optimized in consideration of the aimed signal sensitivity.</p>

				<p>In either case, realistic Monte Carlo studies should be necessary 2 .</p>

				<p>It should be noted that in the models where the scalar and pseudo-scalar couplings are independent, such as in the two Higgs doublet model, the experimental constraints become rather weak, in contrast to the MSSM models which we have so far discussed. The cross sections allowed could become larger by about O(10 5 ), yielding σ(µN → τ X) ∼ O(10) fb at the muon energy of O(100) GeV [13]. At present, the muon beam line at CERN can provide a muon beam with energy up to 190 GeV and 10 14 muons per year [23]. By using this, for instance, we could expect about O(10 2 ) events from Fig.1, or improve the effective scalar coupling by about O(10 2 ).</p>

				<p>If incident muons are polarized, T-odd correlations between the muon spin and the tau momentum and spin polarization vectors can be examined in the µN → τ X reaction . The T-odd correlation would give opportunity to study CP violation in SUSY. They will be studied in our coming publications.</p>

				<p>IV. PROBING e − τ TRANSITION VIA eN → τ X REACTION We would like to comment on another LFV search for e − τ transition through eN → τ X with a high energy electron (or positron) beam. In the MSSM, similar to the ¯ τ R µ L Φ 0 coupling, the ¯ τ R e L Φ 0 coupling is proportional to the tau lepton mass, where Φ 0 could be either h 0 , H 0 or A 0 , and l R and l L (l=e, µ, τ ) are the corresponding right-handed and left-handed leptons, respectively. The coupling of ¯ τ R e L Φ 0 could be as large as that of ¯ τ R µ L Φ 0 , when the slepton mixing betweeñ τ L and e L is similar to that betweeñ τ L and µ L . Therefore, our discussions on the µN → τ X DIS reaction can be directly applied to the case of eN → τ X reaction. Experimental constraints on the effective form factors for e − τ transition are given by τ → eη and τ → eππ decays at the B factories [24] and the e − τ searches at HERA [25]. The strongest bound on the pseudo-scalar coupling for the e − τ transition comes from the τ → eη result, which is similar to the bound on the µ−τ transition from the τ → µη result. For the scalar coupling, the results of the ep → τ X search at HERA give stronger bounds than the τ → eππ result. In the MSSM, therefore, the maximally-allowed cross section for eN → τ X is in the same order of magnitude as that for µN → τ X for the same incident beam energy. At a future electron-positron LC with the CM energy of 500 GeV and the luminosity of 10 34 cm −2 s −1 , 10 22 electrons (or positrons) with the energy 250 GeV would be available per year. Assuming that they could be bombarded on a fixed target with the mass 10 g/cm 2 , we could expect about 10 4−5 of eN → τ X events for σ(eN → τ X) ∼ 10 −3 fb. Therefore, significant improvement , by several orders of magnitude, on the e − τ coupling can be expected over the present limits. Experimental issues in the eN → τ X search, such as background rejections, would be very different from the µN → τ X case. Further studies will appear in our future publications. Combining both the e − τ searches at a LC and the µ − τ searches at a MC and a NF, we could study the slepton mixing and SUSY breaking in more details.</p>

				<head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head>

				<p>We have calculated the cross sections for µN → τ X at the DIS region in the MSSM separately for the Higgs boson mediation and the gauge boson mediation. We have found that this process can be useful to search for the Higgs-boson mediated LFV coupling. In the MSSM, the Higgs boson mediation is constrained from the τ → µη result, so that the cross section is at most 10 −5 fb at the incident muon energy E µ of 50 GeV. If E µ is higher than 50 GeV, contributions from the sea b-quarks become more significant, and thereby the cross section is drastically enhanced. For E µ = 300 GeV, for instance, the cross section can be as large as 10 −3 fb. Experimental issues on the tau identification and background rejection have been briefly examined. We also studied the eN → τ X transition to search for the possible e − τ transition at a future LC, and expect significant improvements . Once high-intensity and high-energy muon and electron beams are available, there would be better opportunity to improve the limit on the LFV couplings for the Higgs boson mediation by a few orders of magnitude. Searches for the µN → τ X and eN → τ X reactions would be competitive to studies of rare tau decays at planned future super B factories.</p>
