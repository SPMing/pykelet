				<p>A generalization of the limiting procedure of Penrose, which allows non-zero cosmological constants and takes into account metrics that contain homogeneous functions of degree zero, is presented. It is shown that any spacetime which admits a spacelike conformal Killing vector has a limit which is conformal to plane waves. If the spacetime is an Einstein space, its limit exists only if the cosmological constant is negative or zero. When the conformal Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal, the limits of Einstein spacetimes are certain AdS plane waves. In this case the nonlinear version of the Randall-Sundrum zero mode is obtained as the limit of the brane world scenarios.</p>

				<p>The plane wave spacetimes are known to posssess various remarkable properties in the context of both classical and quantum gravity. One of these is that any spacetime has a plane wave as its Penrose limit [1]. In a well defined sense plane waves play, around null geodesics, a role that is similiar to the role of the tangent spaces about the points of a manifold. This universal propery of the plane waves can be seen by first choosing, on an arbitrary Lorentzian manifold, a suitable coordinate gauge in a neighborhood of a null geodesic congruence. If the neighborhood chosen in this manner is then blown up uniformly by rescaling the appropriate coordinates, a plane wave spacetime results as the limiting manifold. Since the Einstein-Hilbert action transforms homogeneously under the constant rescalings of the metric, the field equations are preserved during the process. The limits of the vacuum solutions therefore turn out to be the vacuum plane waves. The same argument applies to all spacetime dimensions and extends to Einstein-Maxwell fields. Moreover, in the context of the D=10 string theories, the limiting procedure commutes with T-duality and the scaling rules that are employed stem from the scaling propery of the D=11 supergravity action [2]. Recent discussions of the role of the Penrose limit in the maximally supersymmetric solutions, the worldvolume dynamics and the AdS/CFT correspondence can be found in [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10].</p>

				<p>In its present form the limiting procedure, however, cannot accomodate a non-zero cosmological constant and does not take into account the possibility of dealing with metrics that are homogeneous functions of degree zero in the coordinates. The purpose of this paper is to furnish a generalization of the Penrose limit which covers such a situation. We shall consider spacetimes which admit conformal Killing vectors and possess non-zero cosmological constants. It will be seen that a generalization of the Penrose limit exists if the conformal Killing vector is spacelike and the cosmological constant is negative. Such spacetimes will have limits that are conformal to the plane waves. If the conformal Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal and the spacetime is an Einstein space with a negative cosmological constant, its limit is an anti-de Sitter (AdS) plane wave [11], [12], [13]. From this special case it follows that the relevant brane world scenarios have the nonlinear version of the Randall-Sundrum zero mode[14],[13] as a Penrose limit. Consider a D-dimensional (D ≥ 4) spacetime M D which admits a conformal Killing vector K M : L K g M N = 2Φg M N , (1) where g M N is the metric, Φ is a scalar field on M D and L is the Lie derivative . Then one can always find another metric ¯ g M N on a manifold ¯ M D which is conformal to g M N :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>g M N = W −2 ¯ g M N , (2) for which K M is a Killing vector: L K ¯ g M N = 0. Using on ¯ M D and M D the same coordinate patch X M = (x µ , Z) where µ = 0, . . . , D − 2 and K M = δ M Z , the standard Kaluza-Klein decomposition of ¯ g M N gives ds 2 = W −2 (x α , Z)[¯ g µν (x α )dx µ dx ν − λ 2 (dZ + A µ (x α )dx µ ) 2 ], (3) provided that K M is spacelike: ¯ g M N K M K N = −λ 2 (x α</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>). Since the null geodesics are preserved under conformal transformations, we can choose in a conjugate point-free portion of a null geodesic congruence, either on ¯ M D or M D , the Penrose coordinates[15]:</p>

				<p><formula>x µ = {Y + , Y − , Y j } where j = 1, . . . , D − 3.</formula></p>

				<p>In this coordinate system each null geodesic will be given by Y + = const., Y j = const., Z = const. with Y + labelling the different geodesics and Y − is an affine parameter along the geodesics. In this chart the line element ds n</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>2 = ¯ g µν dx µ dx ν with n = D − 1 becomes ds n 2 = 2dY + [dY − + αdY + + β k dY k ] − C jk dY j dY k , (4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the metric functions α, β k , C jk depend in general on all the coordinates x µ and C jk is a (n − 2) × (n − 2) positive definite symmetric matrix. Moreover, if we let A µ dx µ = A + dY + + A − dY − + A j dY j , the Kaluza-Klein gauge field A µ obeys the gauge condition:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>A − = 0. (5) Suppose now the conformal factor W is decomposed as W (X K ) = B M (X K )X M /l + w(X K ), (6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where l is a real parameter and B M (X K ) and w(X K ) are arbitrary. In the above coordinate gauge the function w will be chosen so that B M obeys B − = 0, (7) in accordance with the gauge condition (5). After choosing the gauges in this manner let us rescale the coordinates by introducing</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>{U, V, X j , ˆ Z} which satisfies Y − = U, Y + = Ω 2 V, Y j = ΩX j , Z = Ω ˆ Z, (8) together with l = Ω ˆ l , (9)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where Ω &gt; 0 is a real number. When these rescalings are taken into account in (3), one gets a two-parameter family of metrics g M N (Ω, l ) and it is useful to view these as metrics on a two-parameter family of spacetimes M D (Ω, l ). This allows one to generalize the discussion given in [16] and interpret the limit in a coordinate independent manner by regarding Ω and l as scalar fields on an associated (D + 2) -dimensional manifold possessing a degenerate metric and boundary. One boundary of the (D + 2) -dimensional manifold is located at Ω = 0 and this will be the limit of interest. Before approaching this boundary let us introduce on M D (Ω, l ) new metrics that are distinguished by hats and are related to the old ones by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ g M N (Ω, ˆ l ) = Ω −2 g M N (Ω, l ). (10) Allowing now Ω → 0, the rescaled line element (3) becomes in the limit: dˆ2 d¯ s 2 , (11) where d¯ s 2 = 2dUdV − C jk (U)dX j dX k − λ 2 (U)(d ˆ Z + A j (U)dX j ) 2 , (12) is the standart plane wave metric, expressed in Rosen coordinates, and assuming that B M (X L ) and w(X L ) contain no piece which is a homogeneous function of degree zero in Y j , Z and l prior to the limit, one gets W 0 = B(U) ˆ Z/ ˆ l + B j (U)X j / ˆ l + w(U), (13) with B(U) = K M B M . Notice that (12) is also obtained by assuming that ¯ g M N is not a homogeneous function of degree zero in Y j , Z and l . Provided B(U) = 0</trash>

					<figDesc>, it is possible to set B(U) = 1 in (11) by redefining the coordinate U and the metric functions B j , w, C jk and λ. From now on we shall assume that B(U) = 0 in the limit and set B(U) = 1.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>It will be convenient to display the limiting metric also in the harmonic coordinates {u, v, x j , z} which covers the whole of the plane wave manifold. The transformation between these two coordinates is well-known[2] and (11) can be cast into the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>dî 2 [z/λ + b k (u)x k + lc(u)] 2 [2dudv − h ij (u)x i x j du 2 − δ ij dx i dx j − (dz − γdu) 2 ], (14) where b k (u), c(u</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>) and h ij (u) are arbitrary functions of u and δ ij is the Kronecker delta. We have dropped the hats on the parameter l for notational convenience. The function γ depends linearly on all the transverse coordinates x j , z and encodes all the information about the conformal Killing vector K</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M = λ(u)δ M z : γ = λ ˙ ω j x j + ˙ λz/λ. (15)</trash>

					<figDesc>Here ω j (u) characterizes the twist of K M ; the conformal Killing vector will be hypersurface orthogonal if ˙ ω j = 0. A dot over a quantity denotes differentiation with respect to u. We have thus seen that any spacetime which admits a spacelike conformal Killing vector has a limit which is conformal to plane waves. The precise from of the conformal factor that one gets depends, of course, on the homogeneity assumptions about B M (X L ) and w(X L ), and (13) turns out to be suitable for Einstein spaces. Let us consider on M D the Einstein-Hilbert action</figDesc>
					<trash>S EH = − 1 2κ 2 D d D X √ −g(R − 2Λ), (16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where κ D is the gravitational constant, g is the determinant of g M N , R is the curvature scalar and Λ is the cosmological constant. When Λ is parametrized as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Λ = −n(n − 1) 2l 2 , (17)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>so that Λ ≤ 0 and the metric, the cosmological constant and the coordinates are rescaled according to (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>8)-(10), the Einstein-Hilbert action transforms as ˆ S EH = (κ 2 D /ˆ κ 2 D )Ω (2−2D) S EH . (18)</trash>

					<figDesc>Here we have taken into account a possible rescaling of the gravitational coupling constant κ D by introducing κ D and assumed that the limits of integrations are independent of Ω. It can be deduced from (18) that if one starts with a metric g M N which is a solution of the Einstein equations G M N = −Λg M N , (19) where Λ is given by (17), then its limit will be again a solution of the same set of equations with Λ ≤ 0. Provided that Λ = 0, (19) imposes the following conditions on the metric functions of (14):</figDesc>
					<trash>λ −2 + b j b j = 1, (20) ¨ c = 0, (21) 2 ˙ b j = − ˙ ω j , (22) ¨ b j = h jk b k , (23) and h jj = − ¨ λ/λ − λ 2 ˙ ω j ˙ ω j /2, (24)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the repeated indices are summed with δ ij . When l → ∞, the cosmological constant vanishes and the original Penrose limits of the vacuum solutions are regained. In this case the function c(u) just represents the conformal invariance of the family of vacuum plane waves and after setting c = 1, field equations reduce only to (24). On the other hand, if l = ∞ and one specializes to D = 4, one finds that the Weyl tensor of (14) vanishes when (20) -(24) are imposed. Consequently, (14) is just the AdS metric expressed in a curvilinear coordinate system if D = 4. This is not suprising because, the only Λ &lt; 0 spacetime which admits a proper conformal Killing vector in D = 4 is the AdS spacetime [17]. This means that AdS spacetime is closed under the above limit and not much is really gained over the Penrose limit in D = 4. The procedure becomes more interesting if D &gt; 4 in which case a large class of Einstein spaces admits conformal Killing vectors. Under rather mild assumptions one can show that D &gt; 4, Λ = 0 Einstein manifolds which admit conformal Killing vectors must have locally the warped product structure: M D = M d × f N D−d , (25) where M d is a d-dimensional space of constant sectional curvature k and N D−d is an Einstein manifold [18]. Let ¯ x a and y Γ be the coordinates and g ab and g ΠΓ be the metrics on M d and N D−d respectively. In this coordinate system, which is not adapted to K M , the line element (3) can be written as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ds 2 = g ab (¯ x c )d¯ x a d¯ x b + f 2 (¯ x c )g ΠΓ (y Θ )dy Π dy Γ , (26)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where the gradient of the warp function f is a closed conformal vector field on M d satis- fying kf 2 − g ab ∇ a f ∇ b f = m, (27) and k = −1/l 2 . The Ricci tensor of N D−d satisfies R ΠΓ = m(n − d)g ΠΓ , where m is a constant but M d will be an Einstein space if and only if it is conformally flat [18]. The metrics on the limits of these warped product manifolds are given by (14) and governed by (20) -(24). The existence of a conformal Killing vector on M D as well as the hypersurface orthogonality of K M are both hereditary properties in the sense of [16]. If K M is assumed to be hypersurface orthogonal, (22) requires that ˙ b j (u) = 0 and (23) reduces to h jk (u)b k = 0. (28)</p>

				<p>Whenever h jk is an invertible matrix, it follows that b j = 0 and λ 2 = 1. In such cases c(u) can be set equal to zero by redefining the coordinates z and v provided l = ∞.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Under these assumptions (14) becomes ds 2 = l 2 z 2 [2dudv − h ij (u)x i x j du 2 − δ ij dx i dx j − dz 2 ]. (29) The only implication of (19) is now h jj (u) = 0, (30)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>and one gets precisely the nonlinear version of the Randall-Sundrum zero mode which was discussed in [13]. It is therefore clear that any Einstein space M D having the metric</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ds 2 = l 2 Z 2 [¯ g µν (x α )dx µ dx ν − dZ 2 ], (31)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where ¯ g µν is Ricci-flat, will have a limit that is given by (29) and (30). Such metrics have been considered in the brane world scenarios where a domain wall Σ, located at Z = l , splits M D into two regions M ± D . In such frameworks the above discussion needs to be refined in two respects. First of all, since the normal derivatives of g M N may suffer discontinuities on Σ, one should now either assume that (1) holds in the bulk outside Σ or treat Φ as a distribution. Secondly, one should see whether the total action [19] S = S EH + S GH + S DW , (32) also transforms homogenously under the rescalings (8)-(10) that are needed in the limit. The last two terms of (32) are due to the presence of Σ in M D . Let n M be the unit normal to Σ and g M N = q M N − n M n N so that q M N is the induced metric on Σ. The Gibbons-Hawking term is</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S GH = 1 κ 2 D Σ± d n X √ −qK, (33)</trash>

					<figDesc>where K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature: K = q M N K M N , K M N = q</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p><formula>P M q Q N ∇ P n Q .</formula></p>

				<p>The last term of (32) is the action for the matter on the domain wall and for our purposes it will be sufficient to take S DW = T</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Σ d n X √ −q, (34)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where T is the tension of Σ. When Σ is initially located at Z = l , the Einstein-Hilbert action for each of M</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>± D will be S EH = − 1 2κ 2 D d n X ∞ l dZ √ −g (R − 2Λ), (35)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>and after choosing the appropriately directed unit normals on the two sides of Σ, the standard tuning argument [20]</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>gives</figDesc>
					<trash>K = −n l , T initial = 2(n − 1) κ 2 D l , κ 2 n = n − 2 2l κ 2 D , (36)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where κ n is the n-dimensional effective gravitational constant. After the rescalings (8) and (9), Σ(Ω) is positioned at Z = ˆ l on M</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>± D (Ω, ˆ l ) and consequently, S EH involves the integrations S EH = − Ω D 2κ 2 D d n X r ∞ ˆ l d ˆ Z √ −g (R − 2Λ), (37)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where X r stands for the rescaled coordinates. The extrinsic curvature is now K(Ω) = −n/Ω ˆ l . If one then performs the conformal transformation (10), S EH picks up another Ω (D−2) factor and K also transforms: K(Ω) → ΩK(Ω). Therefore, ˆ K = −n/ ˆ l . Since S GH and S DW both involve (D − 1)-dimensional volume elements, the endpoint of (8) -(10) is a homogeneous transformation of the total action:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S = Ω (2D−2) ˆ S(κ D , ˆ g M N , ˆ l ), (38)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which means that the cosmological constant and the tension can be tuned on each of M D (Ω, ˆ l ), including the boundary Ω → 0, and one finds</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ˆ K = −n l , T = 2(n − 1) κ 2 D ˆ l , ˆ κ 2 n = n − 2 2 ˆ l κ 2 D . (39)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>One may therefore conclude that the Randall-Sundrum zero mode is indeed the Penrose limit of any brane world scenario which is based on (31) and (32). Notice that in the limiting spacetimê κ n = Ωκ n , T = ΩT initial , (40) and one is dealing with the large tension and large κ n limit of the original domain wall while keeping κ D fixed. Finally, let us note that the above discussion cannot be carried over directly to Einstein spaces which have Λ &gt; 0. This is because, although the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian still transforms homogeneously under (9) and (10) when the sign of Λ is changed in (17), the above gauge choice is no longer available. If one demands to include the de Sitter (dS) space in the limits of such spacetimes, the conformal factor W (X L ) must depend linearly on a homogeneous time coordinate: X 0 = (Y + +Y − )/l , but then (7) will not be a suitable gauge choice. Therefore, the procedure breaks down when Λ &gt; 0 and it is not possible to obtain an analog of the AdS plane waves in a dS space by the same analysis. This is consistent with the D = 4 result that the only Einstein spaces that are properly conformal to non-flat pp-waves are the Siklos solutions [11].</p>
