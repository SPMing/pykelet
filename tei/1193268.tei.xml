				<p>Draft version March 26, 2013 ABSTRACT We study the three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics of the post-core-bounce phase of the collapse of a 27-M star and pay special attention to the development of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and neutrino-driven convection. To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic simulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number exchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-M progenitor was studied in 2D by B. Müller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who observed strong growth of the SASI while neutrinodriven convection was suppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from numerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant instability and leads to large-scale nonoscillatory deformations of the shock front. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for large-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low−-mode SASI oscillations are present in our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing neutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with simpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection is started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it is the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical seed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational wave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D general-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the postbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to determine the primary hydrodynamic instability.</p>

				<head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>Baade &amp; Zwicky (1934) inaugurated core-collapse supernova theory with their seminal prediction that &quot; a super-nova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star. &quot; The very basics of this theory, summarized authoritatively by Bethe (1990), were confirmed by the observation of neutrinos from SN 1987A (Hirata et al. 1987; Bionta et al. 1987): The electron-degenerate core of a massive star (with mass M ∼ 8 − 130 M at zero-age main sequence [ZAMS]), once having reached its effective Chandrasekhar mass, becomes radially unstable. Collapse ensues and, once fully dynamic , separates the core into the homologous, subsonically contracting inner core and the outer core, which is supersonically infalling. When the inner core reaches nuclear density, the nuclear force, which is repulsive at short distances, leads to a stiffening of the nuclear equation of state (EOS).</p>

				<p>matically increased pressure support stabilizes the inner core , which overshoots its new equilibrium , then rebounds into the still infalling outer core . This core bounce launches a hydro - dynamic shock wave , which , endowed with the kinetic energy of the inner core , plows into the outer core . Its progression is , however , soon muffled by energy losses to the dissociation of heavy nuclei and to electron capture neutrinos that are cre - ated and stream out from now optically - thin regions behind the shock. The hydrodynamic shock thus succumbs to the ex - treme ram pressure of the outer core and turns into a stalled accretion shock . In the commonly accepted picture of the neu - trino mechanism ( Wilson 1985 ; Bethe &amp; Wilson 1985 ; Bethe 1990 ; Janka et al . 2007 ) , the shock is revived by the deposi - tion of neutrino energy in a layer of net neutrino heating ( the gain layer ) below the shock . In an alternative scenario , re - quiring very rapid progenitor rotation and efficient magnetic field amplification , a magnetorotational explosion may occur ( e . g . , Burrows et al . 2007b and references therein ) . In order to leave behind a slowly cooling neutron star and not a black hole , shock revival must occur within a few hundred millisec - onds of bounce ( O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott 2011 ; Ugliano et al . 2012 ) .</p>

				<p>While the general picture of core - collapse supernova theory may be well established , details of the explosion mechanism , its dependence on precollapse conditions and input physics , and its neutrino and gravitational wave signals 12 remain to be determined by detailed first - principles numerical simulations .</p>

				<p>In the case of the neutrino mechanism , modern spherically - symmetric ( 1D ) simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport have shown that neutrino heating alone fails to drive an explosion in all but the lowest - mass massive stars ( Liebendörfer et al . 2001 ; Rampp &amp; Janka 2002 ; Thompson et al . 2003 ; Sumiyoshi et al . 2005 ; Kitaura et al . 2006 ; Hüde - pohl et al . 2010 ; Burrows et al . 2007a ) . Spherical symme - try , however , is a poor approximation to the situation after core bounce , even if the initial conditions are nearly spheri - cally symmetric . The weakening shock leaves behind a nega - tive entropy gradient , which is expected to lead to convective instability within milliseconds after bounce ( prompt convec - tion ) . Somewhat later , neutrino heating establishes a negative entropy gradient in the gain region , leading to neutrino - driven convection . Strong deleptonization near the neutrinosphere ( where the neutrino optical depth τ ν ∼ 1 ; located at the edge of the protoneutron star at ∼ 10 11 − 10 12 g cm −3 ) establishes a negative lepton gradient , driving protoneutron star convec - tion .</p>

				<p>The first full axisymmetric ( 2D ) simulations ( Herant et al . 1994 ; Burrows et al . 1995 ; Janka &amp; Müller 1995 , 1996 ; Fryer &amp; Heger 2000 ) showed that 2D neutrino - driven convection could increase the efficacy of the neutrino mechanism by in - creasing the residence time of accreted material in the region of net neutrino heating and leading to high - entropy turbulent flow that aids shock expansion .</p>

				<p>A new instability , the standing accretion shock instability ( SASI ) , was discovered by Blondin et al . ( 2003 ) , who car - ried out idealized 2D simulations of an accretion shock using an analytic EOS , neutrino cooling , but no neutrino heating .</p>

				<p>In 2D , the SASI leads to large scale , low - order ( in terms of spherical harmonics , = {1 , 2} ) deformations of the shock front that vary in time in a predominantly = 1 sloshing - type motion up and down the symmetry axis . These aspher - ical motions lead to larger average shock radii , increase the dwell time of material in the gain region , may lead to sec - ondary shocks , and are thus generally aiding the explosion mechanism ( Ohnishi et al . 2006 ; Scheck et al . 2006 ; Mur - phy &amp; Burrows 2008 ; Ott et al . 2008 ; Marek &amp; Janka 2009 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b ) . In 3D , nonaxisymmetric modes ( m = {− , . . . , 0 , . . . , } ) are excited as well , leading to more complex dynamics and smaller saturation amplitudes for in - dividual modes ( Iwakami et al . 2008 ) .</p>

				<p>In some 3D simula - tions , in particular in those that include some initial rotation , a strong spiral mode ( = 1 , m = ±1 ) , capable of redistribut - ing angular momentum , has been observed ( Blondin &amp; Mez - zacappa 2007 ; Iwakami et al . 2008 , 2009 ; Fernández 2010 ; Wongwathanarat et al . 2010 ; Rantsiou et al . 2011 ) . Perturbation theory and carefully controlled numerical ex - periments suggest that the SASI is driven by an advective - acoustic cycle in which entropy and vorticity perturbations are advected from the shock front to the edge of the protoneutron star . There they trigger the emission of acoustic perturbations that travel upstream in the subsonic flow of the postshock re - gion and amplify perturbations in the shock front , thus creat - ing a feedback cycle that injects power preferentially into low - order modes ( see Foglizzo 2002 ; Foglizzo et al . 2006 , 2007 ; Ohnishi et al . 2006 ; Yamasaki &amp; Yamada 2007 ; Fernández &amp; Thompson 2009b , a ; Scheck et al . 2008 ; Guilet &amp; Foglizzo 2012 and references therein ) . The saturation of the SASI has been proposed to occur via parasitic Rayleigh - Taylor and / or Kelvin - Helmholtz instabilities that operate on the entropy gra - dients and vorticity generated by the SASI ( Guilet et al . 2010 ) .</p>

				<p>In a real core - collapse supernova , neutrino - driven convec - tion and SASI overlap in space and may grow at the same time . In the linear regime , in which seed perturbations are minute , they can be clearly separated : SASI &apos; s fastest growing mode is = 1 , while convective eddies will grow with hori - zontal wavelengths a few times of the entropy scale height , giving ∼ 7 − 8 in the postbounce supernova context ( based on estimates of Foglizzo et al . 2006 ; Herant et al . 1992 ; see also Chandrasekhar 1961 ) . In convection , however , all modes are unstable and will eventually grow to nonlinear amplitudes if convection is able to develop at all . How convection and SASI interact in the nonlinear regime , which of them becomes the dominant instability , how this may depend on the dimensionality ( 2D vs . 3D ) , and the ram - ifications of all this for the explosion mechanism are open questions that are currently under much debate . Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) argued , based on linear theory , that in the absence of large ( i . e . , nonlinear ) perturbations the devel - opment of neutrino - driven convection may be suppressed if slowly developing eddies are advected out of the convectively unstable region before they can grow significantly . In this sce - nario , SASI would be the primary instability . This was also found in the idealized simulations of Ohnishi et al . ( 2006 ) , who studied the 2D evolution of an artificially set up accre - tion shock with a constant accretion rate and analytic neu - trino cooling , heating , and deleptonization functions . Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) performed 2D energy - averaged ( gray ) neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics postbounce simulations of a 15 - M progenitor star in a carefully controlled setting to study the development of the SASI . They , too , confirmed the result of Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) and showed that if sufficiently large ( 1% ) perturbations from sphericity are present in the up - stream flow , neutrino - driven convection becomes the primary and dominant instability . If linearly - growing convection is suppressed by high ad - vection velocities in the gain region , then one would ex - pect a dependence of the relative importance of SASI and convection on the postbounce accretion rate and , hence , on the progenitor star . This was convincingly confirmed by the recent work of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , who carried out full first - principles 2D general - relativistic ( GR ) multi - energy radiation - hydrodynamics postbounce simulations of a 8 . 1 - M low - metallicity star with a small core and low postbounce accretion rate and of a 27 - M star of solar metallicity with a large core and high accretion rate . In agreement with the pre - diction of Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) , they found strong convec - tion and absent SASI in the 8 . 1 - M star and strong SASI and nearly absent convection in the 27 - M progenitor . In both cases , explosions developed within ∼200 ms of bounce .</p>

				<p>In a different line of research targeted at understanding the dependence of the neutrino mechanism on dimensionality , Nordhaus et al . ( 2010 ) carried out 1D , 2D , and 3D Newto - nian collapse simulations of a 15 - M progenitor . They used the simple analytic heating and cooling prescription intro - duced by Murphy &amp; Burrows ( 2008 ) ( hereafter the MB08 &quot; light - bulb &quot; scheme ) on the basis of the work of Janka ( 2001 ) . Their 3D simulations did not show a dominant = 1 oscilla - tory SASI mode observed in 2D ( Scheck et al . 2006 ; Ohnishi et al . 2006 ; Murphy &amp; Burrows 2008 ) . Using the critical luminosity vs . accretion rate approach of Burrows &amp; Goshy ( 1993 ) , they reported that in 3D explosions could be obtained at ∼15−25% and ∼40−50% lower neutrino luminosities than in 2D and 1D , respectively .</p>

				<head>The Nordhaus et al . ( 2010 )</head>

				<p>3D vs . 2D result was not con - firmed by Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) . These authors performed New - tonian simulations with neutrino approximations very similar to the MB08 light bulb , but used a different 3D hydrodynam - ics code . They did not find clear evidence that 3D effects facilitate the development of an explosion to a greater degree than the non - radial motions due to SASI and convection in 2D . However , in agreement with Nordhaus et al . ( 2010 ) , they did not find large - scale oscillatory low - order modes in their 3D simulations . They hypothesized that this may be less of a 3D effect than an effect of the rather simple treatment of neutrino heating and cooling by Nordhaus et al . ( 2010 ) . The arguably greatest limitation of the MB08 light - bulb scheme is its inability to track the contraction of the protoneutron star , leading to too low advection velocities in the gain region , thus artificially favoring neutrino - driven convection over the SASI . The results of Takiwaki et al . ( 2012 ) , whose Newtonian 3D simulations used a multi - energy approximate neutrino trans - port scheme , appear supportive of this assertion . However , these simulations were carried out with very low resolution and the low - order modes appear to be clearly oscillatory only at early times .</p>

				<p>Using the same MB08 light - bulb approximation for neutri - nos and an updated version of the Nordhaus et al . ( 2010 ) code , Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) , Murphy et al . ( 2012 ) , and Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) performed and analyzed another set of 2D and 3D sim - ulations to investigate the roles of SASI and convection in the postbounce evolution of a 15 - M progenitor . Compar - ing 2D and 3D results for the evolution of low - order fluid mode amplitudes , Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) showed that at the same MB08 driving luminosity , oscillatory mode amplitudes are much smaller in 3D than in 2D . In models that develop an explosion a non - oscillatory = 1 dipole asphericity grows already in the early postbounce evolution . Furthermore , they showed that the oscillatory = 1 modes observed in 2D – and generally associated with the SASI – occur even in the case of a high light - bulb driving luminosity , in which neutrino - driven convection is the dominant instability . They argued that in successful explosions by the neutrino mechanism , neutrino - driven convection should be the dominant instability . How - ever , for the reasons put forth by Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) and B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) and discussed in the above , the predic - tive power of these light - bulb simulations may be limited .</p>

				<p>Ultimately , high - resolution 3D energy - dependent GR neu - trino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations will be needed for final answers regarding the explosion mechanisms and the role of the various instabilities involved . Such simulations are computationally extremely challenging and current attempts are forced to use low spatial resolution ( Takiwaki et al . 2012 ; Kuroda et al . 2012 ) , the gray approximation ( Wongwathanarat et al . 2010 ; E . Müller et al . 2012 ; Kuroda et al . 2012 ) , and / or employ an artificial inner boundary , cutting out the protoneu - tron star core ( Wongwathanarat et al . 2010 ; E . Müller et al . 2012 ) .</p>

				<p>In this paper , we present results from 3D hydrodynamic postbounce supernova calculations that attempt to strike a bal - ance between the computationally cheap , but possibly too simplistic light - bulb approximation and true 3D radiation - hydrodynamics simulations , which cannot yet be performed without at least partially debilitating limitations . Our simu - lations use the Zelmani core collapse simulation package ( Ott et al . 2012 ) and are fully general relativistic . We make no symmetry assumptions and use no artificial inner bound - ary . We employ a novel computational setup with a multi - block approach that provides curvilinear grid blocks to track the collapse of the outer core and Cartesian adaptive - mesh re - finement ( AMR ) grids covering the central region , including the protoneutron star and the entire shock . We treat neutri - nos in the postbounce phase with an energy - averaged three - species neutrino leakage scheme with neutrino heating . The only free parameter of this scheme is a scaling factor in the charged - current energy deposition rate . As we shall demon - strate , the leakage scheme captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling , neutrino heating , and lepton number ex - change .</p>

				<p>We apply Zelmani to the collapse and postbounce evolu - tion of the 27 - M progenitor star that was considered by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) and shown to be highly susceptible to the SASI in their fully self - consistent 2D GR simulations . B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) find a SASI - aided explosion that devel - ops within ∼150 − 200 ms after bounce , making this progeni - tor ideal for studying the SASI in computationally expensive high - resolution 3D simulations . We carry out four simula - tions of the 27 - M progenitor , varying the strength of neu - trino heating . We evolve these four models from the onset of collapse to ∼150 − 190 ms after bounce at an effective angular resolution of 0 . 85 • at a radius of 100 km . The linear resolution at this radius is ∼1 . 5 km . The maximum resolution covering the protoneutron star core is ∼370 m .</p>

				<p>We find that neutrino - driven convection is able to grow from the numerical seed perturbations imposed by our Carte - sian AMR approach . It becomes the dominant instability in the postbounce dynamics of all of our models . In the case of strong neutrino heating , convection , which is initially man - ifest as small - scale cells of rising hotter and sinking cooler material , develops into large blobs of high entropy mate - rial . These push out the shock and lead to large - scale non - oscillatory shock deformations . We also observe growth of oscillatory low - ( , m ) deformations associated with the SASI . However , these saturate at small amplitudes that decrease fur - ther with increasing strength of neutrino heating and vigor of convection . The SASI remains sub - dominant at all times in our simulations . Our results suggest that if neutrino - driven convection is able to grow in 3D – which will generally de - pend on the postbounce accretion rate and on the seed pertur - bations present in the flow ( Scheck et al . 2008 ) – it will dom - inate the postbounce flow . This is consistent with the results obtained by Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) with the simpler light - bulb approach . We extract the gravitational wave signals generated by accelerated quadrupole mass motions in our models and find that the strongest component of the signal comes from the initial burst of convection , which grows on the negative entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock .</p>

				<p>This paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 we de - scribe Zelmani and give details on grid setup , EOS , the leakage / heating scheme , and the progenitor model . In Sec - tion 3 we present the results of our simulations . First , in §3 . 1 , we give an overview of the overall postbounce evolution of our models . We then discuss in detail the postbounce config - urations resulting from our leakage / heating scheme ( §3 . 2 ) , the development of neutrino - driven convection and SASI ( §3 . 3 ) , various criteria for neutrino - driven explosions ( §3 . 4 ) , and the gravitational wave signals extracted from our models ( §3 . 5 ) . We summarize our findings and conclude in Section 4 .</p>

				<head n="2">. METHODS AND INITIAL CONDITIONS</head>

				<p>We carry out our 3D GR simulations with the Zelmani core collapse simulation package . Zelmani is based on the open - source Einstein Toolkit 13 ( Löffler et al . 2012 ) , for numerical relativity and relativistic computational astro - physics . It builds upon the Carpet AMR driver ( Schnet - ter et al . 2004 ) and the Llama multi - block system ( Poll - ney et al . 2011 ; Reisswig et al . 2013 ) within the Cactus Computational Toolkit ( Goodale et al . 2003 ) .</p>

				<head n="2">. 1 . Spacetime Evolution and Hydrodynamics</head>

				<p>We evolve the full Einstein equations without approxima - tions in a 3 + 1 decomposition as a Cauchy initial boundary value problem ( see , e . g . , Baumgarte &amp; Shapiro 2010 ) , us - ing the conformal - traceless BSSN formulation ( Baumgarte &amp; Shapiro 1999 ; Shibata &amp; Nakamura 1995 ) . A 1 + log slicing condition ( Alcubierre et al . 2000 ) controls the evolution of the lapse function α , and a modified Γ - driver condition ( Al - cubierre et al . 2003 ) is used for the evolution of the coordinate shift vector β i . The BSSN equations and the gauge conditions are implemented in the module CTGamma using fourth - order accurate finite differencing . Implementation details are given in Pollney et al . ( 2011 ) and Reisswig et al . ( 2013 ) . We note that in its present form , our evolution system is limited to 3D simulations . An extension to 2D along the lines of Baumgarte et al . ( 2013 ) may be possible in future work .</p>

				<p>We use a flux - conservative formulation of the GR Euler equations , implemented in the GR hydrodynamics module GRHydro , which is part of the Einstein Toolkit ( Löf - fler et al . 2012 ) . GRHydro is an enhanced derivative of the Whisky ( Baiotti et al . 2005 ) and GR - Astro / MAHC ( Font et al . 2000 ) codes . It is based on a finite - volume high - resolution shock - capturing scheme and works with general finite - temperature microphysical EOS . We employ the en - hanced piecewise - parabolic method for reconstruction of state variables at cell interfaces ( McCorquodale &amp; Colella 2011 ; Reisswig et al . 2013 ) and subsequently solve approximate Riemann problems to compute intercell fluxes with the HLLE solver ( Einfeldt 1988 ) . Details are given in Reisswig et al . ( 2013 ) . Both spacetime evolution and GR hydrodynamics are dis - cretized in a semi - discrete fashion and coupled with the Method of Lines ( Hyman 1976 ) using a multi - rate Runge - Kutta integrator ( Reisswig et al . 2013 ) , providing fourth - order and second - order accuracy in time for spacetime and GR hy - drodynamics , respectively . The time step is limited by the speed of light and we use a constant Courant - Friedrichs - Lewy factor of 0 . 4 .</p>

				<p>We employ the multi - block infrastructure Llama ( Pollney et al . 2011 ; Reisswig et al . 2013 ) , which allows us to cover the computational domain using a set of overlapping curvi - linear grid blocks that are logically Cartesian but physically 13 http : / / www . einsteintoolkit . org</p>

				<p>Schematic view of a slice through our 3D multiblock grid . Six physically curvilinear ( four are shown ) , logically Cartesian inflated - cube grids with constant angular , varying radial resolution surround a central Cartesian region with five AMR levels ( not all shown ) . The third finest level is adjusted to always encompass the entire postshock region . curvilinear ( so - called &quot; inflated cubes &quot; ) , adapted to the overall spherical topology of the collapse problem . We employ a set of such curvilinear blocks to track the collapse of the outer core , while the interior domain containing the protoneutron star , the postshock region , and the shock itself is covered by an adaptively refined Cartesian mesh ( see Fig . 1 for a schematic view ) .</p>

				<p>The spherical inflated - cube multi - block system discretizes one spherical shell via six angular grid blocks designed such that one angular coordinate direction always coincides at inter - block boundaries . This allows us to use efficient fourth - order one - dimensional interpolation to update ghost zone information between neighboring blocks ( Thornburg 2004 ) . Furthermore , this particular multi - block system of - fers an almost uniform distribution of points across the sphere ( i . e . without clustering of points at the poles ) , thus avoiding distortions and pathologies associated with standard spherical - polar grids .</p>

				<p>The adaptively refined central Cartesian block is based on cell - centered and flux - conservative mesh - refinement tech - niques , provided by the open - source AMR driver Carpet ( Schnetter et al . 2004 ; Reisswig et al . 2013 ) . AMR is imple - mented with subcycling in time , following the approach of Berger &amp; Oliger ( 1984 ) . We make use of refluxing , which correctly adjusts fluxes at mesh refinement boundaries after the AMR restriction operation ( Reisswig et al . 2013 ) . This ensures that mass , momentum , and energy fluxes are ex - actly conserved , even in the presence of strong shocks and other discontinuities . To update zones at AMR boundaries and to initialize new grid points after regridding , we make use of fourth - order prolongation for the spacetime curvature variables , and second - order essentially non - oscillatory pro - longation for the matter variables . As detailed in Reisswig et al . ( 2013 ) , spacetime variables are restricted from fine onto coarse grids using a third - order polynomial , while matter vari - ables are restricted via cell averaging .</p>

				<p>All simulations are carried out with the same general grid setup . In the central region , we use five nested Cartesian grids with a factor of 2 in resolution between each of them .</p>

				<p>The finest grid has a linear cell size dx = 0 . 37 km and ex - tends out to 17 . 7 km . The second finest grid has a cell size of dx = 0 . 74 km and extends to 59 km , while the third grid has dx = 1 . 48 km and is set up to adaptively track the shock , en - suring that shock itself and the turbulent flow in the gain layer behind the shock are always resolved with no worse resolution than dx = 1 . 48 km . For a shock radius of 100 km , this cor - responds to an effective angular resolution dx / R of ∼0 . 85 • .</p>

				<p>There are two additional coarser grids with dx = 2 . 95 km and dx = 5 . 9 km in the Cartesian region , which extends to 532 km , where it overlaps with the outer spherical cube grid . The lat - ter &apos; s radial cell size dr at its inner boundary is the same as the dx of the coarsest Cartesian grid it overlaps with . dr is held constant out to a radius of ∼3000 km and then smoothly reduced to dr = 189 km at the outer boundary at ∼15000 km . Each of the six cubed - sphere blocks has 31 angular zones each in angle σ and ρ . This corresponds to an effective cell size of ∼2 . 9 • .</p>

				<p>We start our simulations at the onset of collapse with only the coarsest of the Cartesian AMR grids active and progres - sively activate the finer grids when the central density in the collapsing core reaches 3 .</p>

				<p>We employ a tabulated version of the finite - temperature nu - clear EOS by Lattimer &amp; Swesty ( 1991 ) . This EOS is based on the compressible liquid - drop model with a nuclear sym - metry energy of 29 . 3 MeV . We use its variant with a nuclear compression modulus K 0 of 220 MeV , since it yields a cold neutron star mass - radius relationship in agreement with cur - rent observational and theoretical constraints ( e . g . , Demorest et al . 2010 ; Hebeler et al . 2010 ; Steiner et al . 2010 ) .</p>

				<p>We employ the Lattimer - Swesty EOS at densities above 10 8 g cm −3 , where T 0 . 5 MeV at all times in the core col - lapse context and nuclear statistical equilibrium ( NSE ) holds .</p>

				<p>At lower densities , we employ the Timmes EOS ( Timmes &amp; Arnett 1999 ) and assume that the matter is an ideal gas com - posed of electrons , positrons , photons , neutrons , protons , al - pha particles , and heavy nuclei with the average A and Z given by the Lattimer - Swesty EOS at the transition density . This is an approximation and may lead to slightly incorrect pres - sures in non - NSE regions that result in changes in the col - lapse times for the silicon and carbon / oxygen shells . Ideally , a fully consistent treatment with multiple advected chemical species , a nuclear reaction network and transition in and out of NSE with a NSE network as proposed by Buras et al . ( 2006b ) should be implemented . This , however , is beyond the scope of the present study .</p>

				<head n="2">. 4 . Neutrino Treatment</head>

				<p>We employ the approximate neutrino treatment of the open - source code GR1D ( O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott 2010 ) , which was adapted to 3D and implemented in the module ZelmaniLeak by Ott et al . ( 2012 ) . The source code is avail - able from http : / / www . stellarcollapse . org .</p>

				<p>Before core bounce , the primary neutrino emission process is electron capture on free and bound protons , leading to a reduction of the electron fraction Y e in the collapsing core .</p>

				<p>We include this effect and associated changes of the specific entropy in the approximate way proposed by Liebendörfer ( 2005 ) . He showed , on the basis of 1D Boltzmann neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations , that Y e in the collapse phase can be well parameterized as a function of rest - mass density ρ . This parameterization shows only small variations with progenitor star and nuclear EOS . We employ an ana - lytic Y e ( ρ ) fit to the results of 1D radiation - hydrodynamics collapse simulations of a 20 - M solar - metallicity progenitor star of Woosley et al . ( 2002 ) obtained with the code and mi - crophysics of Buras et al . ( 2006b ) . The same Y e ( ρ ) profile was used in Ott et al . ( 2007a , b ) and Ott et al . ( 2012 ) . In the late collapse phase , when neutrinos begin to be trapped in the inner core , and throughout the postbounce phase , momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter be - comes non - negligible . The effect of this &quot; neutrino stress &quot; is naturally captured by the coupling of radiation and matter in full neutrino transport calculations ( see , e . g . , B . Müller et al . 2010 ) . In our approximate treatment , we must include it ex - plicitly . We assume that neutrino stress is relevant only above a fiducial trapping density of 2 × 10 12 g cm −3 and approximate the stress as the gradient of the neutrino Fermi pressure . The stress is then included as a source term in the GR hydro - dynamics equations at each time - integration substep and the neutrino Fermi pressure is included in the stress - energy tensor ( see Ott et al . 2007b and O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott 2010 for details ) .</p>

				<p>After core bounce , which we define as the time at which the specific entropy at the edge of the inner core reaches 3 k B baryon −1 , signaling shock formation , the simple Y e ( ρ ) ap - proximation breaks down and fails to even qualitatively cap - ture the effects of neutrino processes occurring in the post - bounce phase . Dissociation of iron - group nuclei by the shock provides a sea of free protons for electrons to capture on , lead - ing to the neutronization burst of electron neutrinos ( ν e ) and a steep drop of Y e in the region just outside the nascent pro - toneutron star . High temperatures and low Y e in the lower postshock region allow for the appearance of positrons that capture on neutrons , leading to the emission of electron an - tineutrinos ( ¯ ν e ) . High temperatures in the protoneutron star core lead to neutral - current pair emission of neutrinos of all species .</p>

				<p>In order to capture the aforementioned processes and their effects in terms of cooling , heating , and deleptonization in the region behind the shock , we switch to the neutrino leakage scheme of O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott ( 2010 ) ( based on the work of Rosswog et al . 2003 and Ruffert et al . 1996 ) at bounce . We consider three neutrino species , ν e , ¯ ν e , and ν x = {ν µ , ¯ ν µ , ν τ , ¯ ν τ } , where we lump the heavy - lepton neu - trinos together , since they participate only in neutral current processes and have very similar cross sections in the core - collapse supernova environment .</p>

				<p>The leakage scheme provides approximate energy and number emission and absorption rates based on local thermo - dynamics and the optical depth in the postshock region . Neu - trino absorption and emission are ignored outside the shock . The optical depth requires a non - local calculation , which we</p>

We then interpolate tri - linearly in ( r , θ , ϕ ) to obtain the optical depth at the centers of Cartesian grid cells . Ideally , an optical depth calculation should be carried out into all directions from any given cell and the minimum value should be used as the optical depth of that cell ( see , e . g . , Ruffert et al . 1996 ) . However , for situa - tions that are spherical at zeroth order , like the one considered here , the computationally much cheaper ray - by - ray approach should be sufficient . In our simulations , we employ 37 rays in θ , covering [ 0 , π ] , and 75 rays in ϕ , covering [ 0 , 2π ] . Each ray has 800 equidistant points to ∼ 600 km and 200 logarith - mically spaced points covering ∼ 600 − 3000 km .</p>

				<p>Using the estimate of the optical depth τ νi , we compute diffu - sive emission rates Q diff νi and R diff νi and obtain the final energy and number loss predicted by the leakage scheme by interpo - lating between free emission and diffusive emission rates ,</p>

				<p>−1 , where µ νi , NS is the chemical potential of neutrino species ν i at its neutrino sphere . The factor F −1 νi is the mean inverse flux factor , which depends on details of the neutrino radiation field . We parameterize it as a function of optical depth τ νi based on the angle - dependent ra - diation fields of the neutrino transport calculations of Ott et al . ( 2008 ) and set F −1 νi = 4 . 275τ νi + 1 . 15 . While the true mean inverse flux factor will asymptote to 1 at infinity , this simple fit leads to values in the postshock region ( we include heating only there ) in agreement with Ott et al . ( 2008 ) . Finally , the factor e −2τν i is applied to strongly suppress heating at opti - cal depth above unity . The leakage scheme implementation in Zelmani varies slightly from the original implementa - tion in O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott ( 2010 , 2011 ) . In O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott ( 2010 , 2011 ) , leakage was calculated only inside the shock to avoid unnecessary calculations outside of the shock where lit - tle cooling or heating occurred . To facilitate easy implemen - tation in Zelmani , where the angle - dependent shock radius is evaluated only infrequently , we have removed the explicit dependence on the shock radius and have replaced it with a condition on the mass fraction of heavy nuclei : we only cal - culate the heating and cooling terms where the heavy nuclei mass fraction is smaller than 0 . 5 or the density is higher than 10 13 g cm −3 .</p>

				<p>We obtain the neutrinosphere locations and the thermody - namic conditions for Eq . ( 3 ) from the rays used for the optical depth calculations . We also solve full leakage problems in - cluding heating along the rays to obtain an estimate for the incident luminosity L νi needed by Eq . ( 2 ) . The estimates for L νi and 2 νi are then interpolated between rays for the local leakage calculations in Cartesian grid cells .</p>

				<p>All of the above leakage calculations are carried out operator - split after the fully coupled spacetime / hydro update and are first order in time . We find this to be sufficiently ac - curate and stable , due to the small time step imposed by the light travel time through the smallest cell . The energy and lep - ton number updates are applied to the fluid rest - frame quan - tities and we ignore velocity dependence or other relativistic effects in consideration of the overall very approximate nature of the leakage scheme . The computationally most expensive aspect of the leakage scheme is the interpolation of density , temperature , and electron fraction onto the rays . This inter - polation is executed at every time step in the highly dynamic early postbounce phase . We later switch to carrying out this interpolation only every 16 fine grid time steps ( correspond - ing to every ∼ 8 × 10 −6 s ) while continuing to evaluate the local expressions at every time step .</p>

( 2002 ) than the work of O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott ( 2011 ) . However , they also predict that this particular presupernova model is a progenitor of a successful neutrino - driven core - collapse supernova .</p>

				<p>Using the spherically - symmetric GR1D code of O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott ( 2010 , 2011 ) and modifying its leakage scheme to be identical to what we use in Zelmani , we find that f heat = 1 . 18 is the critical value of the scaling factor in Eq . ( 2 ) to drive an explosion that sets in at late times after multiple cycles of radial shock oscillations . f heat = 1 . 28 is required to drive an explosion without shock oscillations that sets in at ∼150 ms after bounce .</p>

				<p>We map model s27 to our 3D grid under the assumption that the 1D profile data represent cell averages and use the radii of cell centers for interpolation .

				<head n="3">. 1 . Overall Postbounce Evolution</head>

				<p>We simulate core collapse and bounce of the 27 - M pro - genitor in full 3D with adaptive mesh refinement , adding re - finement levels as the collapse towards a protoneutron star proceeds ( see §2 . 2 ) . Core bounce , defined as the time when the entropy at the edge of the inner core reaches 3 k B baryon −1 , occurs at ∼299 ms . At bounce , we switch from the Y e ( ρ ) pa - rameterization of Liebendörfer ( 2005 ) to the leakage / heating scheme described in §2 . 4 . This scheme includes a scaling factor f heat in the neutrino energy deposition rate ( Eq . 2 ) . We carry out four long - term postbounce simulations , choos - ing f heat = {1 . 00 , 1 . 05 , 1 . 10 , 1 . 15} to study the influence of changes in the heating rate on the postbounce evolution . All models are labeled according to their value of f heat . For exam - ple , s27 f heat 1 . 00 is the model with f heat = 1 . 00 . All models are evolved to 150 ms after bounce and for as long as our com - puter time allocations allow at a cost of ∼ 25 , 000 CPU hours per millisecond of physical postbounce time ( see Table 1 ) .</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The neutrino luminosity emitted from the protoneutron star core and provided by accretion is identical in all models . Hence , as shown in the top panels of Fig . 3 , there is a mono - tonic increase with f heat in the net neutrino heating rate Q net and in the heating efficiency η = Q net ( L νe + L ¯ νe ) −1 , where we use the angle - averaged luminosities at the base of the gain layer . Varying f heat by a moderate 15% from 1 . 00 to 1 . 15 re - sults in ∼100% more total net heating , since the increase in the local energy deposition rate results in an expanded gain layer with more mass that is able to absorb net neutrino en - ergy ( cf . bottom panel of Fig . 3 ) .</p>

				<p>The quantitative differences in neutrino energy deposition translate to qualitative differences in the shock evolution . In model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , which has the least heating , shock stag - nation turns into recession and the average shock radius de - creases to ∼70 km at the end of the simulation . The situa - tion is very different in models s27 f heat 1 . 10 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 , which both show expanding average shock radii , surpassing 300 km at the end of their simulations and trending towards explosion . Model s27 f heat 1 . 05 is somewhere in between , but has a slowly , but steadily increasing average shock radius that reaches ∼190 km at the end of the simulation .</p>

Bottom panel : Mass in the gain layer ( left or - dinate ) and density - weighted average specific entropy in the gain layer ( right ordinate ) . Heating rate , efficiency , and mass in the gain layer all increase monotonically with increasing heating scaling factor f heat . Interestingly , the specific entropy average s gain in the gain layer does not exhibit such a de - pendence on f heat and the s gain curves of all models are nearly identical until 100 ms after bounce , at which point the overall hydrodynamic evolutions have diverged . tities show an initial local maximum at ∼8 ms after bounce , which is due to an initial transient large = 4 deformation of the shock front caused by the Cartesian grid employed in our simulations . We will discuss this further in §3 . 3 . In the first 40 ms after bounce , all models show very similar small de - viations of the shock from spherical symmetry . Differences between models begin to be apparent at the same time their average shock radii begin to diverge . Models s27 f heat 1 . 10 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 exhibit very large asymmetries with σ shock ∼ 30 km and almost a factor of two in radius between maximum and minimum shock radius at the end of their simulations ( see Table 1 for final minimum , maximum , and average shock radii for all models ) . Model s27 f heat 1 . 05 also shows growing asymmetry with increasing postbounce time , similar to the models with f heat = 1 . 10 and 1 . 15 , but , at least in σ shock , a peri - odicity is visible , which is lacking completely or is occurring at a much smaller level in the two models with larger f heat . In model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , which does not show a positive trend in its shock radius , the deviations of the shock from sphericity remain small and maximum and minimum shock radius dif - fer , on average , by ∼20% and this average difference does not grow until the end of the simulation . There is , however , clear oscillatory behavior ( with a short period of ∼15 ms ) in this model &apos; s shock radius variations , which may be indicative of SASI activity . We shall investigate this further in §3 . 3 .</p>

				<head>In Fig . 4</head>

				<p>, we present volume renderings of the specific en - tropy at ∼150 ms after bounce for all four models . The render - ings are all plotted at the same scale to emphasize the differ - ences in shock radius and 3D geometry between the models . The color map and rendering opacity are chosen to emphasize ( i ) regions with specific entropy of ∼4 . 3 k B baryon −1 ( cyan ) , ( ii ) regions with a representative &quot; intermediate &quot; specific en - tropy of ∼16 k B baryon −1 ( yellow ) , and , ( iii ) regions with a representative &quot; high &quot; specific entropy of ∼20 k B baryon −1 ( red ) . Red and yellow thus mark gas in the high - entropy gain layer , while cyan indicates the shock front and an iso - entropy surface at the edge of the protoneutron star . While the shock appears nearly spherical in model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , it is clearly deformed in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 , and strongly so in models s27 f heat 1 . 10 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 . One also notes that in the latter two models the highest - entropy gas is concentrated in the re - gion of greatest expansion while it is more evenly spread out in the other models . The shock deformation in these models is clearly dominated by low - modes , but there is still much smaller - scale structure in the form of protrusions caused by rising hot gas bubbles that push out the shock front at local scales . The overall morphology of the expanding shock fronts seen in these models is similar to what was found by Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) in exploding 3D Newtonian light - bulb models of a 15 - M progenitor , but their shock fronts appear to have less small - scale structure than ours ( cf . their Fig . 20 ) . Figure 5 depicts colormaps of 2D x − z slices of the specific entropy in models s27 f heat 1 . 00 , s27 f heat 1 . 05 , and s27 f heat 1 . 15 at 80 , 115 , and 154 ms after bounce . Model s27 f heat 1 . 10 is not shown , but is overall very similar to model s27 f heat 1 . 15 . The evolution towards large shock radii , large - scale shock de - formation , and peak specific entropies of 20 k B is obvious in the slices belonging to models s27 f heat 1 . 05 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 . In the latter , at 154 ms , one notes a large high entropy area subtending an angle of ∼30 • and ranging from the gain ra - dius out to the shock , which has the overall greatest radii in this region . This is consistent with the volumetric view of this model at approximately the same time , shown in Fig . 4 . In the bottom panel of Fig . 3 , we plot the density - weighted average of the specific entropy in the gain layer s gain ( dashed lines ; right ordinate ) . While the heating rates differ strongly between the models , their s gain remain very similar until ∼100 ms after bounce and s gain ∼ 12 k B baryon −1 . The top row of Fig . 5 shows that the peak entropy reached in the gain layer is very comparable among the three displayed models at 80 ms after bounce . At 115 ms and , in particular , at 154 ms , the situation is different . The models with increasing shock radii and shock deformations develop large regions with spe - cific entropies in excess of 20 k B baryon −1 and large spatial variations . In model s27 f heat 1 . 15 , at 154 ms after bounce , the expanding deformed shock has already swept up cold gas that now moves through the gain layer , leading to a decreasing s gain in this model . This is consistent with the decrease in s gain seen at the onset of explosion in the 3D and 2D simula - tions of Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) and Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) . At the same postbounce time , the shock in model s27 f heat 1 . 00 has receded to ∼90 km and the distribution of specific entropy be - hind it is much more uniform than in the other models . Its average entropy continues to increase despite the decrease in net heating ( cf . top panel of Fig . 3 ) . This is due to the combined effect of smaller shock radii and small deforma - tion of the shock front . The average specific entropy in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 also grows , since its net heating rate continues Figure 4 . 3D Volume renderings of the specific entropy at ∼150 ms after bounce in the four simulated models .

The colormap is chosen such that cyan corresponds to a moderate specific entropy of ∼4 . 3 k B baryon −1 , indicating the shock front and low - entropy regions near the protoneutron star .

				<p>The three - species leakage / heating scheme employed in our simulations goes beyond the MB08 light - bulb approach taken by many recent 3D hydrodynamic studies ( e . g . , Nordhaus et al . 2010 ; Hanke et al . 2012 ; Burrows et al . 2012 ; Murphy et al . 2012 ; Dolence et al . 2012 ) . These simulations use an - alytic cooling functions and neglect important protoneutron star cooling by ν x . They also do not take into account changes of the electron fraction Y e after bounce ( Hanke et al . 2012 ) or do so only via a parameterization of Y e ( ρ ) , which cannot account for the strong deleptonization in the region behind the shock due to electron capture on free protons . Neutrino heating is realized in these simulations by an analytic heating function with spatially and temporally constant neutrino tem - perature and luminosity . An important consequence of these approximations is that accreted material settling onto the pro - toneutron star cannot sufficiently cool , deleptonize and con - tract ( Hanke et al . 2012 ; B . Müller et al . 2012a ) . This , in turn , results in too large shock radii and low advection speeds Figure 5 . Colormaps of the specific entropy in the x - z plane in models s27 f heat 1 . 00 ( left column ) , s27 f heat 1 . 05 ( center column ) , and s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( right column ) at 80 , 115 , and 154 ms after core bounce . The linear scales of the three vertical panels are 350 , 450 , and 900 km at these three times . The values of the specific entropy in the convectively unstable gain region increase with time in all simulations . Model s27 f heat 1 . 00 exhibits a stagnant shock and only small deviations from sphericity . The average shock radius is secularly growing in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 with slightly stronger neutrino heating and the shock is more aspherical . Model s27 f heat 1 . 15 is on track to explosion and exhibits , at 154 ms after bounce , a strongly deformed shock with a single large high - entropy bubble . through the convectively unstable gain layer that may artifi - cially favor the growth of convection over SASI ( Scheck et al . 2008 ; Foglizzo et al . 2006 ; B . Müller et al . 2012a ) . Our leak - age / heating scheme is designed specifically to overcome these limitations at little additional computational cost . We take into account cooling by ν e , ¯ ν e , and ν x , account for the change in electron fraction by ν e and ¯ ν e emission and absorption . Our heating prescription uses the true ν e and ¯ ν e luminosities avail - able at a given position for heating ( as computed by leak - age / heating at smaller radii ) and the mean - squared neutrino energies entering the heating rate are determined by assum - ing black body emission from the ν e and ¯ ν e neutrinospheres , taking the time - changing thermodynamic locations on these surfaces into account .</p>

				<p>While clearly not as sophisticated as recent gray multi - D ( e . g . , Scheck et al . 2008 ; E . Müller et al . 2012 ; Kuroda et al . 2012 ) or energy - dependent ( e . g . , Ott et al . 2008 ; Marek &amp; Janka 2009 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b , a ; Takiwaki et al . 2012 ) neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics calculations , the goal of our approach is to capture the essential qualitative features correctly and reproduce quantitative results approximately . In the following , we investigate the extent to which our scheme lives up to its premise .</p>

Center panel : Evolu - tion of the protoneutron star radius , defined as the location of the 10 11 g cm −3 point on the angle - averaged rest - mass density profile . The protoneutron star contracts as neutrino - cooling and deleptonizing material is settling on its sur - face . This is expected from 1D and 2D neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations ( cf . B . Müller et al . 2012b ) , but is not captured by the simple MB08 light - bulb approach ( Richers et al . 2013 , in prep . ) . Bottom panel : Evolution of the gray , angle - averaged neutrinosphere radii Rν as predicted by the leakage scheme . The well - known hierarchy Rν e &gt; R¯ νe &gt; Rν x is repro - duced and the neutrinospheres follow the contraction of the protoneutron star as expected from full radiation - hydrodynamics simulations ( e . g . , Janka et al . 2007 ) . surface of the protoneutron star following B . Müller et al . ( 2012b ) , shrinks from ∼70 km early after bounce to 40 km at 180 ms after bounce . At the same time , the enclosed baryonic mass increases from ∼1 . 15 M to 1 . 55 M . If accretion sud - denly stopped completely at 180 ms , the gravitational mass of the final , cold neutron star would be ∼1 . 4 M ( Lattimer &amp; Prakash 2001 ) . The increase in mass and decrease in radius of the protoneutron star seen in our simulations is qualitatively consistent with the findings of B . Müller et al . ( 2012b ) and Buras et al . ( 2006a ) for different progenitors . B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , who studied the s27 progenitor , do not show these quantities . Hence , a direct quantitative comparison is not pos - sible .</p>

				<p>The angle - averaged neutrinosphere radii given in the lower panel of Fig . 6 show that the leakage scheme correctly re - produces the well known hierarchy R νe &gt; R ¯ νe &gt; R νx of neu - trinosphere radii in the postbounce preexplosion phase ( e . g . , Janka et al . 2007 ) .

				<p>The smoothness of the curves is due entirely to the angle averaging . The profiles show the progressive deleptonization and contraction of the outer protoneutron star and the development of the high - entropy gain layer as is expected from full radiation - hydrodynamics simulations ( e . g . , Buras et al . 2006b , a ; Lentz et al . 2012 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b ) . Note , however , that our leakage / heating scheme tends to somewhat overestimate cooling and delep - tonization at optical depths of a few , leading to a dip in Ye and a local tem - perature minimum around 40 km . This temperature minimum is shown in a zoomed - in inset in the temperature panel .</p>

				<p>The smoothness of the profiles is due entirely to angle averaging . The overall qualitative behavior of all quantities is as expected from more complex radiation - hydrodynamics simulations ( cf . Buras et al . 2006b and Fig . 5 of Dessart et al . 2006 ) . The radial extent and specific entropy of the gain layer increase with time , while the changes in the specific entropy below ∼40 km simply reflect protoneutron star contraction . The latter is also well captured by the rising temperature at the protoneutron star edge , indicating compression . The strong deleptonization of the postshock region caused by the ν e neutronization burst shortly after bounce is still visible in the Y e profile at 40 ms after bounce . The outer postshock region re - leptonizes over time due to a slight dominance of ν e over ¯ ν e absorption in the gain layer . In the lower postshock region ( R ∼ 10 − 45 km ) , neutrino cooling and deleptonization continue and , as ex - pected from more accurate neutrino transport calculations , a strong negative lepton gradient develops that may drive protoneutron star convection ( e . g . , Dessart et al . 2006 ; Buras et al . 2006a ) .</p>

				<p>Comparing the Lν i shown here with those provided for the same progenitor in Fig . 8 of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) demonstrates that our much more approxi - mate neutrino treatment still yields luminosities that agree within ∼20% with the results of true radiation - hydrodynamics simulations . Bottom panel : Evo - lution of the mean neutrino energies ν i in the same models , obtained via the assumption of black body emission at the respective neutrinospheres . Af - ter the transient very early postbounce phase , the usual hierarchy of mean neutrino energies is established . At 80 − 100 , ms after bounce , the evolution becomes qualitatively incorrect when ν e and ¯ ν i surpass ν x . Compar - ison with the results of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) shows that this and the overall high predicted ν i are an artifact of the leakage / heating scheme . and ν x as predicted by our leakage / heating scheme for models s27 f heat 1 . 05 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 , which we take as representa - tive examples . Differences between these models are minor and due to the greater heating in model s27 f heat 1 . 15 . Since B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) provide these luminosities from their 2D simulations in their Fig . 8 , we can directly compare with their results . Their L νe peaks at ∼385 B s −1 ( 1 B = 10 51 erg ) , while ours peaks at ∼365 B s −1 ( a 5% difference ) . At 100 ms after bounce , the B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) simulation suggests L νe ∼62 B s −1 , while we find ∼68 B s −1 in model s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( ∼73 B s −1 in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 ) , a ∼10% ( ∼20% ) differ - ence . The ¯ ν e and ν x luminosities compare similarly well .</p>

				<p>The rather good agreement in total neutrino luminosities with the much more detailed radiation - hydrodynamics simulation of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) suggests that our leakage / heating scheme captures the overall neutrino emission and its energet - ics in an acceptable way .</p>

				<p>The situation is different for the mean neutrino energies ν shown in the lower panel of Fig . 8 . We obtain esti - mates for ν of each species by assuming black body emis - sion from its neutrinosphere in the same way as for the mean - squared energies that enter the heating function ( Eq . 2 ) . This kind of estimate is not reliable in the very early , highly dy - namical postbounce phase , but ∼20 ms after bounce , the usual hierarchy of neutrino energies νx &gt; ¯ νe &gt; νe is estab - lished analogously to the hierarchy of neutrino sphere radii ( cf . lower panel of Fig . 6 ) . This hierarchy is , however , bro - ken at times 80 − 100 ms , when the mean ν e and ¯ ν e ener - gies exceed the mean energy of ν x . This is clearly an artifact of our leakage / heating scheme and will not happen in nature . It is also not found by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . The reason for this incorrect behavior can be understood by considering the neutrinosphere radii plotted in the lower panel of Fig . 6 and looking at the temperature and Y e profiles shown in Fig . 7 for model s27 f heat 1 . 05 . At postbounce times 80 ms , one notices a global minimum in Y e around 40 − 50 km . At the same location , a local temperature minimum develops . Both are related and caused by the inability of the leakage / heating scheme to establish a correct balance between emission and absorption at optical depths of a few . Unfortunately , the ν x neutrinosphere recedes precisely into the local temperature minimum , while the ν e and ¯ ν e neutrinospheres sit in the lo - cal maximum at slightly greater radii . While the differences in temperature are not large , they are sufficient to explain the incorrect evolution of the νi .</p>

				<p>Comparing the values of νi predicted by the leakage scheme with the results of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) at times before the qualitative evolution becomes unrealiable , we find that the leakage scheme systematically overpredicts the mean energies . For example , at 50 ms after bounce , in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 , we find νe ∼16 MeV , ¯ νe ∼18 MeV , and νx ∼18 . 5 MeV . At the same time the νi found by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) are , in the same order , 9 . 3 MeV , 12 . 3 MeV , and 14 MeV .</p>

				<p>In summary , the results shown in this section indicate that the leakage / heating scheme used in our simulations yields overall qualitatively correct thermodynamics / stratification in the postshock region and captures the integral neutrino emis - sion to within ∼20% of fully self - consistent simulations . It fails , however , to yield reliable predictions for the mean neu - trino energies , in particular at later postbounce times . Since energy ( and lepton number ) absorption rates depend sensi - tively on neutrino energy , the leakage / heating scheme , at least in its present form , cannot be employed to make reliable pre - dictions of the spectrum of the emitted neutrinos or the com - position of explosion ejecta .</p>

				<head n="3">. . SASI and Neutrino - Driven Convection</head>

				<p>The recent 2D radiation - hydrodynamics core collapse and postbounce simulations of the s27 progenitor carried out by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) show a very clear and clean growth of a dominant periodic = 1 SASI mode . The relative amplitude ( with respect to the average shock radius ) of the = 1 mode saturates in their simulations at a very large ∼45% , indicating a large - scale periodic dipole deformation . In their simulation , neutrino driven convection is only a secondary instability that develops in the non - linear phase , but may be connected with the saturation itself ( Guilet et al . 2010 ) .</p>

				<p>It is now interesting to ask if the SASI is the primary insta - bility driving asphericity in the s27 progenitor also in our 3D simulations or if neutrino - driven convection dominates early on and possibly suppresses the growth of coherent SASI oscil - lations . It is furthermore interesting to study how the roles and Figure 9 . Colormaps showing the time evolution of the angle - averaged Brunt - Väisälä ( BV ) frequency ω BV in units of ms −1 ( Eq . 5 ; left panels ) and anisotropic velocity v aniso in units of the speed of light c ( Eq . 7 ; right panels ) in models s27 f heat 1 . 05 ( top panels ) and s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( bottom panels ) . Also indicated are the maximum shock radius ( red curves ) , the average shock radius ( blue curves ) , and the minimum shock radius ( green curves ) . Note the different radial scales of the top and bottom panels . We mask out v aniso and ω BV outside the average shock radius , where they are not reliable , since at most angles the radial region is actually outside of the shock . Shortly after bounce , the stalling shock leaves behind a negative entropy gradient , leading to ω BV &gt; 0 and thus convective instability , strongest at radii between 20 and 40 km . Prompt convection develops quickly and is strong , as indicated by the large v aniso in the right panels . Subsequently , convective instability and , as shown by the right panels , convection , develops in the gain layer and , after ∼30 − 40 ms or so , also at the edge of the protoneutron star core , due to the negative lepton gradient . Note that high v aniso at late times prevails to significantly smaller radii than the inner radius of convective instability , indicating large asymmetries and undershooting of decelerating convective plumes . prominence of SASI and convection depend on the strength of neutrino heating . It is evident from the discussion in §3 . 1 and Figs . 4 and 5 that deviations from sphericity develop at large scales in our models . We shall now take a more quantitative look at the development of this asphericity .</p>

This approximation may lead to quantitatively incorrect estimates of C L in the protoneutron star where neutrinos are trapped or partially trapped .

				<p>where we are following the definition of Buras et al . ( 2006a ) ; Takiwaki et al .

For simplicity , we approximate the gravitational accel - eration as −GM ( r ) r −2 assuming an angle - averaged spherical matter distribution in our postprocessing analysis . Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) pointed out that Eq . ( 4 ) is an insuf - ficient criterion for the development of large - scale convective instability in the postshock region . A small ( linear ) pertur - bation that could seed convection in the unstable gain layer is advected in towards the convectively stable cooling layer with the background flow . This advection may occur faster than the time it takes for convection to grow from the small perturbation . It is thus necessary to compare the advection timescale τ adv with the growth time for convection in the gain layer , τ conv ≈ ω −1 BV . Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 )</p>

				<p>where v r is the radial velocity through the gain region . A small scale perturbation of magnitude δ in entering the gain layer from above may at most grow by a factor exp ( χ ) to δ out = δ in exp ( χ ) during its advection through the gain layer ( Scheck et al . 2008 ) . According to the linear analysis of Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) , χ 3 is required for convection to de - velop in the gain layer from small perturbations δ in . Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) noted , then demonstrated , that the situation is dif - ferent if the seed perturbations δ in are sufficiently large so that the time integral of the buoyant acceleration becomes compa - rable to the advection velocity . In this case , the advected seed may grow into a buoyant plume and stay in the gain layer in - stead of leaving it . The results of Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) indicate that local seed perturbations of order 1% , e . g . , in the upstream radial velocity , may already be sufficient to trigger convection even if χ &lt;</p>

				<p>. Top panel : Foglizzo parameter χ ( Eq . 6 ) as a function of time after bounce . At times 40 ms after bounce , the shock is still expanding and a quasi - stationary gain layer has not yet developed . χ is not reliable in that phase . At later times , it stays consistently below the critical value of 3 suggested by Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) as being necessary for convection to develop from arbitrarily small perturbations . Note that stronger neutrino heating leads to greater χ , since ω BV is larger . Bottom panel : Density - weighted average of the anisotropic velocity v aniso ( Eq . 7 ) in the gain layer inside the minimum shock radius . As in the case of χ , this quantity is not reliable in the highly dynamic early postbounce phase . The early peak around 10 ms is related to prompt convection , which ebbs over ∼30 ms . Starting at ∼40 ms after bounce , when neutrino driving becomes efficient ( cf . Fig . 3 ) , v aniso increases nearly monotonically in a very similar way in all models .</p>

				<p>Only model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , which has the weakest neutrino heating , deviates from this trend at times 100 ms after bounce .</p>

				<p>If convection does develop , a simple measure of its strength is the anisotropic velocity v aniso , which we define , following Takiwaki et al . ( 2012 )</p>

				<p><formula>, as v aniso = ρ v r − v r 4π 2 + v 2 θ + v 2 ϕ 4π ρ 4π , ( 7 )</formula></p>

				<p>where . 4π denotes an angle average at fixed radius . v aniso essentially extracts the magnitude of the velocity component that does not belong to a purely radial background flow . We compute v aniso by introducing a spherical auxillary grid onto which we interpolate the Cartesian coordinate velocity com - ponents and transform to obtain v r , v θ , and v ϕ . We then inte - grate over 4π steradian at each radius r to obtain the various angle - averaged quantities . v aniso is high in regions of large fluctuations in v r and high non - radial velocities v θ and v ϕ . We note that high v aniso in the postshock region is a good measure for non - radial flow in that region . If this non - radial flow is due to prompt / neutrino - driven convection or induced by the SASI is difficult to decide , in particular when the SASI has reached the non - linear regime . v aniso is thus most useful at early postbounce times and both its time evolution and radial distribution must be carefully considered .</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Fig . 9 , we present colormaps showing the time evolutions of radial profiles of the angle - averaged ω BV ( left panels ) and v aniso ( right panels ) for models s27 f heat 1 . 05 ( top panels ) and s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( bottom panels ) as representative cases for mod - erate and strong neutrino heating . The qualitative evolution is the same in all models .</p>

				<p>Within milliseconds of bounce , a highly convectively unsta - ble region develops where the negative entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock is strongest . As is evident from the v aniso colormaps , a strong burst of prompt convection de - velops and smoothes out this entropy gradient within ∼20 ms of bounce . The highly dynamical early phase of shock expan - sion and prompt convection is over by ∼40 ms after bounce , when the shock has settled at ∼100 − 120 km . At this time , the gain layer has developed and neutrino heating creates a negative entropy gradient and thus instability to convection between ∼80 km and the shock . Also , deleptonization at the edge of the protoneutron star ( cf . Fig . 7 ) creates a negative lepton gradient , driving protoneutron star convection , which sets in at 35 − 40 ms after bounce and is clearly marked by a band of high v aniso , spatially coinciding with the band of con - vective instability in the protoneutron star . Figure 10 shows the evolution of the Foglizzo parame - ter χ ( Eq . 6 ; top panel ) and the density - weighted average anisotropic velocity in the gain layer ( bottom panel ) . At the early postbounce times at which prompt convection takes place , both quantities are poorly defined , since the shock ex - pansion is still rather dynamic and a quasi - stationary gain layer does not yet exist . This explains the large variations seen at early times in particular in χ . Once the postbounce quasi - equilibrium in the postshock region is established , χ settles at values between 0 and 2 in all models , which is consistent with what B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) found for the s27 progenitor .</p>

				<p>The χ 3 criterion proposed by Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) for the development of convection in the gain layer is never ful - filled in any of our models . Nevertheless , neutrino - driven convection does develop and becomes strong in all of our models . This is obvious from the radial v aniso distribution shown in Fig . 9 . As soon as the gain layer develops and ω BV becomes large , a broad region of high v aniso appears and traces the region of instability . This is indeed neutrino - driven con - vection , as can be seen from the entropy slices in the top panel of Fig . 5 , which show fully developed neutrino - driven convec - tion at ∼80 ms after bounce . The development of neutrino - driven convection in the gain layer can also be inferred from the density - weighted average v aniso over the gain layer ( bot - tom panel of Fig . 10 ) . v aniso has an initial local maximum due to prompt convection and decreases as the latter ebbs only to increase again at 40 ms after bounce when neutrino heat - ing in the gain layer becomes efficient and drives convection ( cf . Fig . 3 ) . B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , in their axisymmetric simulation of the s27 progenitor , did not observe the development of neutrino - driven convection , in agreement with the prediction of Foglizzo et al . ( 2006 ) that for χ 3 small perturbations are advected out of the gain layer before they can grow into buoyant plumes . While there are many technical differences between the simulation of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) and the ones presented here , the key difference relevant for the de - velopment of neutrino - driven convection in our simulations is our choice of a Cartesian AMR grid as opposed to the spherical polar grid of the axisymmetric code of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . A spherical polar grid is ideal for tracking the spherically - symmetric collapse phase and the upstream flow outside the shock after bounce . Seed perturbations re - main minimal and neither prompt nor neutrino - driven convec - tion grow in the simulation of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . Our Cartesian AMR grid , on the other hand , leads to significant perturbations in multiple ways : ( i ) The Cartesian grid itself only imperfectly resolves spherical flow and perturbations of at most order dx / R shock , where dx is one linear computational cell size , are generated locally at the shock front . ( ii ) Also due to its rectangular nature , the grid has = 4 , m = 4 symmetry , which leads to buildup of numerical noise primarily in modes with = 4 , m = {−4 , 0 , 4} . ( iii ) In our AMR setup , the shock is formed on the finest grid and then is allowed to pass through two mesh refinement boundaries before it reaches the grid that will track its subsequent evolution . The crossing of AMR boundaries causes large perturbations in the shock front that are also of = 4 character . ( iv ) The AMR grid that tracks the shock front expands whenever the shock expands . The AMR boundary must constantly be filled via interpolation from the next coarser grid , which also introduces noise . Points ( i ) - ( ii ) are true for any code using a Cartesian grid , e . g . , the CASTRO code used in the recent simulations of Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) ; Murphy et al . ( 2012 ) ; Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) , while ( iii ) - ( iv ) are due to our particular approach in Zelmani , which may or may not be different from what is done in CASTRO and other codes .</p>

				<p>There are multiple ways in which one could quantify the magnitude of the perturbations present in the early postbounce phase in our models . One indicator may be the relative devia - tion of the shock front from spherical symmetry quantified in Fig . 11 . The = 4 grid modes indeed imprint themselves on the shock front , though the deviation of the shock itself from sphericity is not large . The root - square - sum A 4 of the normal - ized = 4 , m = {−4 , . . . , 4} components of the shock front has a maximum of ∼ 1 . 4% at ∼10 ms after bounce . This could be interpreted as a lower bound on the deviation from sphericity of the postshock flow and may already be sufficient to seed convection ( Scheck et al . 2008 ) . Alternatively , we consider the relative root - mean - square deviation from sphericity of any fluid quantity X on a spherical shell of radius R ,</p>

					<trash>ξ ( X ) = ( X − X 4π ) 2 4π X 4π , ( 8 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where ·· 4π denotes an angular average at fixed radius and we have dropped the dependence on R for simplicity . Evaluat - ing ξ for density , radial velocity , entropy , and pressure in the preshock region ( R &gt; R shock , max ) , we find only very small de - viations from sphericity of order 0 . 1% at any time . We carry out this analysis also at a radius just inside the shock ( dynam - ically adjusting R to be ∼ R shock , min − 1 km ) , which should be reliable in the dynamical shock expansion phase . Any pertur - bations would have to come from shock passage , since con - vection had no time to grow . For this , we find large deviations of 5 − 10% in density , entropy , and pressure 15 . These devia - tions are present already milliseconds after bounce and they peak when the shock passes through the boundary of the sec - ond finest refinement level ( at 59 km ) at ∼3 ms after bounce . This indicates that shock passage through refinement bound</p>

				<p>The large - amplitude perturbations present in the early post - bounce flow are more than sufficient to overcome advection and seed prompt convection , which grows within milliseconds of bounce in our models ( cf . Figs . 9 and 10 ) . Neutrino - driven convection is , in turn , seeded by the turbulent flow of prompt convection and by additional , though much smaller magni - tude , noise coming from interpolation at the AMR boundary and from the Cartesian representation of the spherically ac - creting outer core .</p>

				<head n="3">. . 2 . SASI</head>

				<p>Convective overturn , first prompt , then neutrino - driven , de - velops early on in our simulations and appears dominant . We can , however , not yet exclude growth of the SASI . The con - ditions for SASI growth are very different from those for convection . Any standing accretion shock is unstable to the SASI , with = 1 , m = 0 , ±1 modes being the most unstable and growing from arbitrarily small perturbations ( e . g . , Guilet &amp; Foglizzo 2012 ) . The linear growth rate of the SASI can be expressed as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>ω SASI = ln |Q| τ cyc , ( 9 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>where Q is the cycle efficiency , defined as the amplification factor of perturbations in each advective - acoustic cycle , and τ cyc is the duration of a cycle ( see , e . g . , Scheck et al . 2008 for a detailed discussion ) . Qualitatively , τ cyc depends on the radius at which the shock stalls and on the timescale for advection of entropy / vorticity perturbations between shock and protoneu - tron star edge . A smaller shock radius and shorter advection time will thus lead to a smaller τ cyc and faster SASI growth . Strong neutrino heating , as pointed out by Yamasaki &amp; Ya - mada ( 2007 ) and Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) , increases the buoyancy in the gain layer and leads to both larger Q and shock oscilla - tion frequencies ( connected with τ cyc ) , while the growth rate is not strongly affected .</p>

				<p>A characteristic feature of the SASI in its linear phase is the exponential growth of oscillatory low - mode deformations of the shock front . We look for evidence for the SASI in our sim - ulations by decomposing the shock surface R shock ( θ , φ ) into spherical harmonics :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>a m = ( −1 ) |m| √ 4π ( 2 + 1 ) 4π R shock ( θ , φ ) Y m ( θ , φ ) dΩ . ( 10 )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that a 00 corresponds to the average shock radius and that the definition of the a m used here gives individual a m ampli - tudes that are a factor of ( 2 + 1 ) smaller than the definition for a 0 used by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) in the axisymmetric case , but at each , there are ( 2 + 1 ) more modes in our case .</p>

				<p>The Y m are the standard real spherical harmonics ( e . g . , Boas 2006 ) , which we use with the normalization factors given in Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) . We also define the quantities A as the root - square - sum of the a m for a given normalized by the average shock radius a 00 ,</p>

				<p>In</p>

				<p>Fig . 11 , we present in four panels , from top to bottom , the time evolutions of the A 1 − A 4 amplitudes of the shock front in all four models . In the first ∼20 ms after bounce , the ini - tial = 4 deformation due to our Cartesian grid imprints itself onto the shock front and the A 4 amplitude is dominant . Subse - quently , the other modes grow . For SASI growth , the expec - tation is that the = 1 , m = {−1 , 0 , 1} modes have the fastest growth rate and have oscillatory behavior , which should be reflected in the A 1 amplitude . In models s27 f heat 1 . 00 and s27 f heat 1 . 05 , A 1 indeed is the fastest growing amplitude and shows the expected oscillatory behavior throughout the sim - ulated postbounce interval , suggesting the presence of the SASI . However , the maximum value of A 1 reached is ∼0 . 04 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than what was re - ported by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) for their 2D simulation of the s27 progenitor .</p>

				<p>For the two models with stronger neutrino heating , s27 f heat 1 . 10 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 , the situation is different . Their A 1 and A 2 amplitudes hover around very similar small</p>

Normalized = 1 , m = {−1 , 0 , 1} mode amplitudes a 1m / a 00 of the shock front plotted on a linear scale ( top panels ) and their absolute values plotted on a logarithmic scale ( bottom panels ) for models s27 f heat 1 . 00 ( left panels ) and s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( right panels ) . Model s27 f heat 1 . 00 shows a clear exponential growth of oscillatory modes , but saturation occurs at amplitudes that are about an order of magnitude smaller than in the 2D simulation of the same progenitor carried out by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . Model s27 f heat 1 . 15 , which has strong neutrino heating and intense neutrino - driven convection also shows some oscillatory = 1 mode growth , though at a longer oscillation period , lower saturation amplitudes , and without a well defined exponential growth phase . values without obvious oscillatory behavior until ∼100 ms after bounce , when large - scale deviations from sphericity ( cf . Fig . 4 ) lead to strongly growing amplitudes in all . This was also observed in the high - luminosity light - bulb simula - tions of Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) and Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) . A 1 is the dominant amplitude and reaches ∼0 . 1 in model s27 f heat 1 . 10 and about 0 . 03 in model s27 f heat 1 . 15 at the end of its simulation . It is interesting to note that model s27 f heat 1 . 05 , which has a positively trending shock radius at the end of its simulation , has clearly growing A 2 , A 3 , and A 4 amplitudes at late times , while A 1 remains the dominant mode with stable amplitudes near 0 . 03 .</p>

				<p>For further insight into the nature of the observed mode evo - lution , we plot , in Fig . 12 , the individual = 1 , m = {−1 , 0 , 1} normalized mode amplitudes a 1m / a 00 in linear ( top panels ) and logarithmic scale ( bottom panels ) for models s27 f heat 1 . 00 ( left panels ) and s27 f heat 1 . 15 ( right panels ) . The former model has the weakest neutrino heating and least vigorous neutrino - driven convection of all our models while the lat - ter model has the strongest heating and most vigorous con - vection . All = 1 modes in model s27 f heat 1 . 00 show a clear oscillatory behavior and , importantly , an exponential growth phase between ∼20 and ∼80 ms after bounce can be made out . However , saturation occurs at low a 1m / a 00 ∼ 0 . 01 for all modes . As noted before , this is an order of magnitude smaller than found in the axisymmetric simulations of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) ( in which neutrino - driven convection did not develop as a primary instability ) .</p>

				<p>Interestingly , some of the a 1m / a 00 modes in model s27 f heat 1 . 15 do exhibit oscillatory behavior , though with larger periods than in model s27 f heat 1 . 00 . This is expected for SASI growth under the influence of strong neutrino heating ( Yamasaki &amp; Yamada 2007 ; Scheck et al . 2008 ) . The growth also saturates more quickly at amplitudes that remain a factor of ∼2 smaller than in model s27 f heat 1 . 00 until ∼100 ms after bounce , when the mode growth becomes non - oscillatory . It is not possible to unambiguously and clearly identify a phase of exponential growth of the a 1m / a 00 modes in this model .</p>

				<p>In summary , there is clear evidence for SASI growth in our models . It is strongest in the model with the least neutrino heating and weakest neutrino - driven convection . It is weakest in the model with the most neutrino heating and the strongest neutrino - driven convection . However , even in the model in which SASI growth is strongest , the SASI saturates at ampli - tudes that are an order of magnitude smaller than in the 2D simulation of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , which did not have any neutrino - driven convection . These observations suggest that 3D neutrino - driven convection is indeed detrimental to the development of large - amplitude SASI . This confirms the findings of Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) ; Guilet et al . ( 2010 ) ; Bur - rows et al . ( 2012 ) ; Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) . Furthermore , our results show that both instabilities can coexist and grow at the same time , but even if convection is suppressed ( a case we cannot study in our 3D Cartesian AMR code ) , the nearly equal splitting of the = 1 power across the three azimuthal m modes in 3D , will likely reduce the magnitude of deviations from sphericity that can be driven by the SASI alone . More - over , the SASI , once it has reached its non - linear phase , will trigger neutrino - driven convection ( Scheck et al . 2008 ; Guilet et al . 2010 ; Burrows et al . 2012 ; B . Müller et al . 2012a ) , which may very well become the dominant instability , in particular if neutrino heating is strong .</p>

				<head n="3">. 4 . Criteria for Neutrino - Driven Explosions</head>

				<p>The simulations presented here end before an explosion is fully developed in any of our models . Nevertheless , in - teresting trends can be observed . Models s27 f heat 1 . 10 and s27 f heat 1 . 15 have strongly positively trending shock radii at the end of their simulations . The shock in model s27 f heat 1 . 05 also expands at late times , but the development of an explo - sion is definitely more marginal . Model s27 f heat 1 . 00 has a receding shock and thus a rather negative prognosis regarding explosion .</p>

				<p>A variety of criteria for neutrino - driven explosions have been discussed in the literature and it is interesting to see how the trends observed in our models compare with what is ex - pected from theory and other simulation results .</p>

				<p>From the bottom panel of Fig . 3 we find that models with stronger neutrino heating and , thus , more vigorous neutrino - driven convection have systematically more mass in the gain layer ( M gain ) that can absorb neutrino energy . The low - amplitude SASI seen in our models , which is strongest in models with weakest heating and convection , does not appear to have any positive effect on M gain in our simulations . In models that are trending towards explosion , M gain increases as shock expansion sets in . This is consistent with previous work giving the most optimistic prognosis for models with the greatest M gain ( e . g . , Murphy &amp; Burrows 2008 ; Scheck et al . 2008 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b ; Hanke et al . 2012 ) .</p>

				<p>Also shown in the bottom panel of Fig . 3 is the density - weighted average of the specific entropy in the gain layer ( s gain ) . All models , trending towards explosion or not , ex - hibit the same s gain evolution until ∼130 ms after bounce , when the most optimistic models actually move to somewhat smaller s gain ( cf . the discussion in §3 . 1 ) . Thus , in agreement with Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) , the average entropy in the gain layer is not a good indicator for a model &apos; s potential for explosion .</p>

				<p>A criterion frequently used to diagnose neutrino - driven ex - plosions arises from the comparison of the timescale for neu - trino heating τ heat and the advection timescale τ adv for material to pass throught the gain layer ( Burrows &amp; Goshy 1993 ; Janka 2001 ; Thompson et al . 2005 ; Murphy &amp; Burrows 2008 ) . If heating is faster than advection through the gain layer , then a fluid parcel entering the gain region may absorb sufficient energy to reach positive total specific energy and thus become unbound . For τ adv / τ heat 1 , shock expansion should set in , further increasing τ adv and thus leading to positive feedback and runaway expansion .</p>

				<p>In our simplified analysis , we set τ heat = |E gain | / Q net , where Q net is the net integral heating rate in the gain layer and |E gain | is the volume integral of the ( Newtonian ) total specific energy of material in the gain layer , given , e . g . , by the integral over Eq . ( 3 ) of B . Müller et al . 2012b . We note that the internal en - ergy of the LS220 EOS is defined with respect to a free neu - tron gas , this defines the zero of our internal energy . There are a variety of possible definitions for τ adv ( cf . the discussions in Murphy &amp; Burrows 2008 ; Marek &amp; Janka 2009 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b ) . Here , we use the definition τ adv = ˙ M / M gain , where M gain is the mass in the gain region and ˙ M is the ac - cretion rate through the shock . Note that this definition is dif - ferent from what we use in the computation of the Foglizzo χ parameter ( Eq . 6 ) .</p>

				<p>In the top panel of Fig . 13 , we plot τ adv / τ heat as a func</p>

Top panel : Ratio of advection and heating timescales τ adv / τ heat as a function of time after bounce in our models ( left ordinate ) and Epos , the volume integral over positive values of the total specific energy in the gain region ( right ordinate ) . τ adv / τ heat 1 is considered to be a condition for runaway explosion . It is satisfied by all of our models with optimistic out - look . Models s27 f heat 1 . 15 , s27 f heat 1 . 10 , and s27 f heat 1 . 15 reach the threshold at ∼100 , ∼115 , and ∼142 ms after bounce , respectively . Roughly ∼20 ms later , these models are beginning to develop regions with positive total en - ergy , which may be interpreted as the onset of explosion . Bottom panel : Maximum of the ratio of the angle - averaged squared speed of sound to the angle - averaged squared escape velocity . According to the antesonic condi - tion of Pejcha &amp; Thompson ( 2012 ) , no solution for a spherical stationary accretion shock exists for max ( c 2 s / v 2 esc ) &gt; 3 / 16 ≈ 0 . 19 and an explosion is expected to set in in models that surpass this value . tion of time after bounce for all of our models ( left ordinate ) . The behavior is as expected : the two models s27 f heat 1 . 15 and s27 f heat 1 . 10 , which are strongly trending towards explo - sion reach τ adv / τ heat 1 already at ∼100 and ∼115 ms af - ter bounce . The marginal model s27 f heat 1 . 05 also shows in - creasing τ adv / τ heat , which reaches 1 at ∼ 142 ms after bounce . There is , however , no hope for model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , where τ adv / τ heat always remains below ∼ 0 . 5 .</p>

				<p>Also shown in the top panel of Fig . 13 is E pos ( right ordi - nate ) , the integral energy of unbound material ( with positive total specific energy , again defining the internal energy with respect to a free neutron gas ) . When τ adv / τ heat &gt; 1 . 4 in our models , material starts to become unbound and E pos grows rapidly . However , at the end of our simulations , it is still far away from the energy needed to unbind the entire envelope and lead to a canonical ∼1B core - collapse supernova explo - sion . We caution the reader to not overinterpret E pos – it is unreliable at this point . Rather , what is important to note is that towards the end of the simulations there is an increasing amount of unbound material for the highest values of f heat .</p>

				<p>To obtain a quantitatively reliable measure of the asymptotic explosion energy one must follow the explosion to late times , consistently track or account for recombination ( ∼8 - 9 MeV per nucleon ) , and consider the binding energy of the overly - ing envelope ( ∼ 1 B ; Woosley et al . 2002 ) .</p>

				<p>Finally , in the bottom panel of Fig . 13 , we plot the time evolution of the maximum of the ratio of the angle - averaged square of the speed of sound c 2 s to the angle - averaged square of the escape velocity , which we approximate as v 2 esc ≈ 2GM ( r ) / r , where M ( r ) is the enclosed baryonic mass . This ratio is interesting , since Pejcha &amp; Thompson ( 2012 ) have re - cently derived the antesonic condition ,</p>

				<p>0 . 2 − 0 . 22 , which is consistent with the expectation of Pejcha &amp; Thompson ( 2012 ) . Model s27 f heat 1 . 00 , which has the most pessimistic outlook , does not reach max ( c 2 s / v 2 esc ) 0 . 19 , while the marginal model , s27 f heat 1 . 05 does . The prognosis , according to Pejcha &amp; Thompson ( 2012 ) is thus similar to the one based on the τ adv / τ heat &gt; 1 runaway condition .</p>

				<head n="3">. 5 . Gravitational Wave Signals</head>

				<p>Besides the neutrino signals already discussed in §3 . 2 , grav - itational waves ( GWs ) are the only other direct probe of the processes occurring in the postshock region and in the pro - toneutron star . The overall GW signature of core - collapse su - pernovae has been reviewed in detail by Ott ( 2009 ) and Ko - take ( 2011 ) and we refer the interested reader to these reviews for an in - depth discussion of the various potential GW emis - sion processes and their underlying physics .</p>

				<p>GW observations of the next galactic core - collapse super - nova could provide important insight into the role and rel - evance of multi - dimensional fluid instabilities , rotation , the structure of the protoneutron star , and the nuclear EOS ( Dim - melmeier et al . 2008 ; Marek et al . 2009 ; Yakunin et al . 2010 ; Murphy et al . 2009 ; Röver et al . 2009 ; Ott 2009 ; Kotake 2011 ) . Recently , Logue et al . ( 2012 ) carried out a proof - of - principle study , demonstrating that Bayesian inference allows to select between different explosion mechanisms for a galac - tic core - collapse supernova . The reliability of this depends on the availability of robust waveform predictions from sim - ulations . Most currently available core - collapse supernova waveforms come from 2D simulations ( as summarized by Ott 2009 ; Kotake et al . 2011 ) , which can predict only one of the two independent polarizations . In the context of nonro - tating or slowly rotating neutrino - driven core - collapse super - novae , only very few waveform predictions from 3D simula - tions without symmetry constraints exist . Fryer et al . ( 2004 ) , carried out Newtonian 3D smoothed - particle hydrodynamics simulations with gray flux - limited diffusion neutrino trans - port and studied the GW emission from matter motions and asymmetric neutrino emission up to ∼80 ms after bounce in a variety of different precollapse configurations with and with - out initial rotation and large - scale asphericities . Kotake et al . ( 2009 , 2011 ) performed Newtonian 3D hydrodynamic simu - lations with a light - bulb scheme ( similar to MB08 , but with a better approximation to changes in Y e ) . They used ana - lytic initial conditions , a fixed accretion rate and a fixed in - ner spherical boundary at 50 km , but were able to evolve for ∼500 ms and studied the GW emission from matter dynamics and asymmetric neutrino emission . Scheidegger et al . ( 2010 ) performed full 3D Cartesian ( without inner boundary ) New - tonian collapse and postbounce simulations of a slowly rotat - ing progenitor with neutrino leakage ( but no heating ) . They employed a monopole approximation for gravity with rela - tivistic corrections and evolved to ∼100 ms after bounce . Re - cently , E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) presented Newtonian 3D post - bounce simulations with GR corrections to the monopole term of the Newtonian potential . They used a time - dependent inner boundary that contracts from 60 − 80 km to 15 − 25 km over 1 s following the prescription of Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) , but were able to evolve multiple progenitor models for 1 . 2 s using a ray - by - ray gray two - species approximate transport scheme ( neglecting ν x ) and imposed neutrino luminosities at the inner boundary . They extracted and studied in detail the GW emis - sion due to matter dynamics and anisotropic neutrino emis - sion .</p>

				<p>While the simulations presented in this study do not have the more sophisticated neutrino transport treatment of E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) , they do not have an artificial inner bound - ary with imposed core neutrino luminosities , are carried out in full GR , and include the cooling due to ν x emission from the protoneutron star . It is , hence , worthwhile to study the GWs emitted by our models . We restrict ourselves to GWs from the dominant accelerated quadrupole matter motions and ignore GWs from asymmetric neutrino emission . The ratio - nale for the latter is that our simple leakage scheme is unfit to give a reasonable estimate for the true neutrino radiation field anisotropy leading to GW emission . Moreover , as demon - strated by previous work ( Kotake et al . 2009 , 2011 ; E . Müller et al . 2012 ; Marek et al . 2009 ; Yakunin et al . 2010 ) , GW emis - sion due to asymmetric neutrino emission occurs at too low frequencies to be relevant for earthbound detectors such as Advanced LIGO ( Harry ( for the LIGO Scientific Collabora - tion ) 2010 ; Shoemaker 2010 ) , Advanced Virgo ( Accadia et al . ( Virgo Collaboration ) 2011 ) , and KAGRA ( Somiya ( for the KAGRA collaboration ) 2012 ) .</p>

				<p>We employ the quadrupole approximation for extracting GWs from our simulations and use the expressions detailed in Ott et al . ( 2012 ) . In principle , we could extract the grav - itational waveforms directly from the spacetime , but the re - sults of Reisswig et al . ( 2011 ) suggest that the quadrupole ap - proximation is very likely sufficiently accurate for stellar col - lapse spacetimes with a protoneutron star .

				<p>The early emission sets in ∼10 ms after bounce and is due to prompt convection that dominates the aspherical dynamics in the early postbounce phase , but has decayed by ∼40 ms af - ter bounce . The GW signal from convection and other fluid instabilities is of stochastic nature ( cf . Kotake et al . 2009 ; Ott 2009 ) and its time series cannot be predicted exactly . The GW signal of prompt convection , since it is emitted within mil - liseconds of bounce by the strongest first few overturn cycles , is particular sensitive to the perturbations seeding prompt con - vection . Note that the time series of h + and h × from prompt</p>

				<p>Characteristic spectral strain spectra h char ( f ) f −1 / 2 of all four models at a distance of 10 kpc compared with the design noise levels √ S ( f ) of Advanced LIGO in the broadband zero - detuning high - power mode ( aLIGO ZD - HP ) , KAGRA , and Advanced Virgo in wideband mode ( AdV WB ) . convection in the two models are quite different , but the over - all amplitudes agree well , but peak in different viewing direc - tions . The subsequent evolution of the GW signals is similar in both models , both polarizations , and both observer posi - tions . After an intermittent quiescent phase , GW emission picks up again at times 80 ms after bounce when aspherical dynamics becomes strong throughout the entire postshock re - gion ( cf . Fig . 9 ) . In this phase , the GW emission transitions to higher frequencies , indicating that emission from deceler - ation of downflows at the steep density gradient at the edge of the protoneutron star ( as first pointed out by Murphy et al . 2009 ) and convection in the protoneutron star play an increas - ing role . While both models have expanding shocks at the end of their simulations , the shock acceleration has not become sufficiently strong to lead to an offset in the GW signal ( GW memory ) seen in other work that followed exploding models to later times ( e . g . , Murphy et al . 2009 ; Yakunin et al . 2010 ; E . Müller et al . 2012 ; Kotake et al . 2009 , 2011 ) .</p>

				<p>The peak GW strain amplitudes reached in our models are from prompt convection and go up to |h|D ∼20 cm ( ∼6 . 5 × 10 22 at 10 kpc ) . Scheidegger et al . ( 2010 ) found |h|D ∼10 cm and Fryer et al . ( 2004 ) found |h|D ∼12 cm , but we note that the GW signal will depend on the strength of prompt convec - tion , which is different from model to model . The approaches of E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) and Kotake et al . ( 2009 , 2011 ) do not allow them to study prompt convection . The typical am - plitudes reached in the preexplosion phase are ∼3 cm ( ∼10 −22 at 10 kpc ) . This is comparable to , but somewhat larger than what E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) found in the preexplosion phase of their models . This may be due the different progenitor models used and / or to the rather large inner boundary radius of their models in the preexplosion phase . Our typical |h| are also quantitatively consistent with the findings of the simpler 3D simulations of Scheidegger et al . ( 2010 ) and Kotake et al . ( 2009 , 2011 ) , but are a factor of a few smaller than predictions from 2D simulations ( e . g . , Marek et al . 2009 ; Yakunin et al . 2010 ; Murphy et al . 2009 ) . Figure 15 contrasts the angle - averaged characteristic GW strain spectra h char ( f ) ( Flanagan &amp; Hughes 1998 ) of our models with the broadband design noise levels of advanced - generation GW interferometers , assuming a source distance of 10 kpc . The spectra are scaled with a factor of f −1 / 2 to allow one - to - one comparison with the detector one - sided am - plitude spectral noise density √ S ( f ) , which has units of Hz 1 / 2 .</p>

				<p>Most of the detectable emission is within ∼60 − 1000 Hz and at essentially the same level of ∼2 − 6 × 10 −23 Hz −1 / 2 . A galac - tic event ( at 10 kpc ) appears to be well detectable by the upcoming generation of detectors . All four models , while having distinct individual h + and h × time series that vary greatly in the time domain , exhibit essentially the same ro - bust spectral features , independent of f heat and the exact post - bounce time the individual models are evolved to . The low - frequency to intermediate - frequency emission is most likely due to prompt convection in the early postbounce phase , while the high - frequency peaks at ∼400 Hz and ∼900 Hz are most likely due to the deceleration of downflows at the protoneu - tron star surface and protoneutron star convection . A more detailed investigation of these features must be left to fu - ture work , since it would require multiple quadrupole inte - grals to isolate emission regions as done , e . g . , by Murphy et al . ( 2009 ) . Our present simulations provide only one global quadrupole integral and we do not have sufficiently finely sampled output for a postprocessing analysis of the GW sig - nal .</p>

				<p>The total energy emitted in GWs is 3 − 4 × 10 −10 M c 2 in all our models and about 50% of the emitted energy is due to the higher - frequency GW emission at later postbounce times . This finding is consistent with the 3D results of Scheidegger et al . ( 2010 ) . E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) , on the other hand , found emitted GW energies of only ∼10 −11 M c 2 . Their models do not include prompt convection and emit most of their GW energy at frequencies below ∼400 − 600 Hz . This , again , may be due to the different considered progenitor structures and / or to the inner boundary of their simulations .</p>

				<head n="4">. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head>

				<p>We have carried out four 3D general - relativistic core collapse and postbounce simulations of the 27 - M solar - metallicity progenitor of Woosley et al . ( 2002 ) , systemati - cally varying the rate of neutrino energy deposition to study the effect of variations in neutrino heating on the 3D post - bounce evolution in general and on the standing accretion shock instability ( SASI ) in particular . These simulations nei - ther employed an artificial inner boundary nor did they make any symmetry assumptions or approximations for the gravita - tional field . The resolution of our simulations is nearly twice as high and we carried them out for nearly twice as long as the only previous 3D GR study of Kuroda et al . ( 2012 ) . For neutrinos , we used an energy - averaged ( gray ) three - species neutrino leakage / heating scheme in the postbounce phase , whose only free parameter is a scaling factor in the energy deposition rate . The leakage scheme captures the es - sential aspects of neutrino cooling , lepton number exchange , and neutrino heating as predicted by fully self - consistent 1D and 2D neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations . Im - portantly , our simulations do not suffer from the limitations of simpler analytic &quot; light - bulb &quot; heating / cooling schemes , which cannot capture the contraction and deleptonization of the pro - toneutron star and result in artificially large shock radii and overestimated advection times through the postshock region ( Richers et al . 2013 , in prep . ) . The light - bulb approach , due to its simplicity and low computational cost , is being employed in many contemporary 3D simulations ( e . g . , Nordhaus et al . 2010 ; Hanke et al . 2012 ; Burrows et al . 2012 ; Murphy et al . 2012 ; Dolence et al . 2012 ) . However , as pointed out by Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) and B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , light - bulb calcu - lations may yield qualitatively incorrect results for the post - bounce hydrodynamics and the respective roles and relevance of neutrino - driven convection and the SASI .</p>

				<p>Our approach was designed specifically to avoid the prob - lems of the light - bulb scheme and provide a realistic post - bounce setting for more robust conclusions on the postbounce evolution and the role of hydrodynamic instabilities . At the same time , our leakage / scheme is still computationally much cheaper and simpler than the approximate gray or energy - dependent 3D neutrino transport schemes of Kuroda et al . ( 2012 ) , Takiwaki et al . ( 2012 ) , and E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) ; Wongwathanarat et al . ( 2010 ) . This affords us with the ability to carry out parameter studies with high numerical resolution as presented in this work for the 27 - M progenitor .</p>

				<p>B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) previously carried out an axisym - metric ( 2D ) simulation of the same 27 - M progenitor with their 2D GR radiation - hydrodynamics code . They found neutrino - driven convection to be suppressed due to the high postbounce accretion rate and , thus , short advection time through the convectively unstable gain layer . The SASI is the primary instability in their simulation and seeds convection , which grows only as a secondary instability once the SASI has reached non - linear amplitudes .</p>

				<p>Our models show instead early and strong growth of con - vective instability . It is initially prompt , driven by the nega - tive entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock . Sub - sequently , convection is driven by neutrino energy deposi - tion in the gain layer . Neutrino - driven convection first mani - fests itself in small - scale local rising hotter and sinking cooler blobs of postshock material . In models with strong neutrino heating that are trending towards explosion , the small scale blobs combine over time to a few large , near volume - filling high - entropy regions whose expansion pushes out the shock . This was also observed in the high - luminosity light - bulb sim - ulations of Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) and Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) .</p>

				<p>These large blobs lead to a low - - mode dominated structure of the expanding shock . The shock , however , has a com - plicated substructure of protruding bumps caused by smaller - scale plumes that perturb it locally . Models whose shock ex - pansion becomes dynamical , surpass the runaway explosion criterion τ adv / τ heat 1 ( Burrows &amp; Goshy 1993 ; Janka 2001 ) and satisfy the antesonic condition of Pejcha &amp; Thompson ( 2012 ) . Both criteria for explosion yield predictions consis - tent with the trends in our models . Interestingly , shortly after the τ adv / τ heat 1 condition is met by our models , individual fluid cells behind the shock reach positive total energy , indi - cating the transition to explosion .</p>

				<p>While neutrino - driven convection is the fastest growing and overall dominant instability , our analysis suggests that all of our models exhibit some growth of clearly periodic low - de - formations of the shock front that are characterstic of the lin - ear phase of the SASI . As expected from linear perturbation analysis , we find that the = 1 , m = {−1 , 0 , 1} modes exhibit the fastest growth . However , our results also show that the saturation amplitudes of the oscillatory = 1 , m = {−1 , 0 , 1} modes are , in the best case , an order of magnitude smaller than in B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . The SASI remains a sub - dominant instability in all of our models . Furthermore , we find the SASI to be strongest in the model with the least neutrino heating and the weakest neutrino - driven convection . Models with stronger heating and more vigorous convection have lower saturation amplitudes of the oscillatory modes , but develop large non - oscillatory deformations of = 1 , 2 , 3 char - acter that are caused by low - mode neutrino - driven convection and are unrelated to the SASI .</p>

				<p>Our simulations satisfy all the requirements laid out by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) for the development of strong SASI in the 27 - M progenitor : GR gravity , an EOS that results in a fairly compact protoneutron star , and the inclusion of all neutrino species and deleptonization of the protoneutron star . Yet , our results turn out to be very different from what B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) found . What is the root cause of this discrepancy ? On the one hand , our simulations are 3D , split - ting , on average , the 2D = 1 SASI power across three az - imuthal m modes . This may explain lower saturation ampli - tudes , but cannot explain the early growth of neutrino - driven convection that is absent from the 2D simulation of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) . On the other hand , – and , as we are convinced , more importantly – our simulations used a central Cartesian adaptive - mesh refinement ( AMR ) grid , which imparts pertur - bations of order of 1 − 10% onto the very early postbounce flow , seeding prompt convection . This , in turn , acts as seed for neutrino - driven convection in our models . The seed perturba - tions are sufficiently large for convection to develop despite the high accretion rate and correspondingly short advection time through the gain layer . Neutrino - driven convection be - comes dominant and limits the growth of the SASI , in agree - ment with the 2D work of Scheck et al . ( 2008 ) . We expect any 3D simulation relying on 3D Cartesian AMR with sim - ilar resolution to have similarly large seed perturbations for convection . The recent 3D light - bulb simulations of Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) ; Murphy et al . ( 2012 ) ; Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) are all subject to these perturbations .</p>

				<p>The question of the magnitude of seed perturbations was not raised by B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) , who used a spherical - polar grid that leads to only minute perturbations from the growth of numerical noise during collapse . Is the almost per - fectly spherical postbounce state of B . Müller et al . ( 2012a ) representative of nature or should one expect significant as - phericities to be present in the outer core ? Some guidance on the size of perturbations induced by turbulent convection during late time burning in core - collapse supernova progen - itors is already available from the 2D and 3D simulations of Meakin , Arnett , and collaborators ( Meakin 2006 ; Meakin &amp; Arnett 2006 , 2007b ; Arnett &amp; Meakin 2011 ) . There are two important results from these multi - dimensional stellar evolution calculations that pertain to the expected density perturbation amplitudes in precollapse cores . First , 2D and 3D simulations of the oxygen shell burning dominated phase in a 23 - M star ( Meakin &amp; Arnett 2007b ) have clarified the basic mechanism responsible for the origin of the fluctuations . In short , Meakin &amp; Arnett ( 2007a ) found that the root - mean - square ( rms ) density fluctuations are largest at the convective boundaries . By interpreting the dy - namics of the convective boundary layer in terms of g - modes excited by the turbulent convection , it was shown that the rms density fluctuation amplitude can be related directly to the background stellar structure and the Mach number of the convective flow , with</p>

				</figure>

				<p>where M c is the rms Mach number of the convective flow , ω BV is the Brunt - Väisälä frequency in the stable layer adjacent to the convection zone , v s is the sound speed of the gas , and g is the gravitational acceleration . The first term on the right hand side , which is very small , is relevant to the interior of the con - vection zone , where density fluctuations arise solely from the presence of velocity fluctuations in a nearly adiabatic layer . The second term is significantly larger and applies to the sta - ble layers bounding the convection zone , reflecting the exci - tation of fluid motions in these regions in the form of internal waves ( predominantly g - modes ) . The 27 - M progenitor of Woosley et al . 2002 has a turbu - lent Mach number of ∼0 . 1 to 0 . 2 in the silicon burning con - vective shell overlying the core , and two peaks in ω BV of im - portance : the peak corresponding to the inner edge of the ac - tive silicon burning shell ( corresponding to the outer edge of the iron core ) , and a peak deeper in associated with the out - ermost extent of the now extinguished silicon burning core . Both peaks have values of v s ω BV / g of ∼1 , indicating that rms density fluctuations at these locations will be of order the tur - bulence Mach number of the convection , or ∼ 10 − 20% . The spike in ω BV associated with the outer extent of the silicon core burning epoch will be accreted into the shock within ∼15 ms of bounce , while the edge of the iron core will be accreted a little later , at ∼60 ms after bounce .</p>

				<p>The second result from the multi - D stellar convection sim - ulations of Meakin and Arnett involves the interaction of nu - clear burning shells at late times . While the results on bound - ary layer fluctuations described above are considered to be robust by those authors , the presence of two or more convec - tive shells in close proximity , as found in late burnings stages , has been found to drive additional motion at the convective boundaries and correspondingly larger density fluctuation am - plitudes . In the most relevant case of a silicon burning shell around an iron core , the interaction between the silicon , oxy - gen , neon , and carbon shells were found to produce a dramatic increase in boundary layer distortion , eventually leading to a complete disruption and mixing of the multi - shell burning re - gion ( Meakin 2006 ; Arnett &amp; Meakin 2011 ) . This result is likely to be due , at least in part , to the inconsistency between the initial stellar model used ( based on mixing length theory ) and a more realistic turbulent convection as represented by the numerical simulation . Judging the robustness of these shell - interaction results , however , awaits 3D simulations since all of the multi - shell calculations performed to date have been restricted to 2D geometry which is known to result in exag - gerated velocities in regions of thermal convection . From this body of work , it would appear that the presence of density fluctuations with amplitudes of at least 1% , and possibly as large as 10 to 20% , should be expected in the material accret - ing into the shock at early postbounce times in a collapsing iron core .</p>

				<p>The fast growth of neutrino - driven convection in our cur - rent models is almost certainly caused by the large seed per - turbations from our Cartesian AMR grid . In 2D simulations , the growth of neutrino - driven convection may go along with SASI growth or , if not genuine SASI , then at least large - scale oscillatory low - deformations of the shock front ( B . Müller et al . 2012a ; Burrows et al . 2012 ; Fernández &amp; Thompson 2009a ; Scheck et al . 2008 ) . Our 3D models do not exhibit any large - scale oscillatory features . Rather , models evolv - ing towards an explosion develop non - oscillatory large - scale asphericities at late times and produce a globally aspherical explosion morphology without a need for SASI - driven = 1 deformations . This qualitative finding is in agreement with the results of the convection - dominated 3D Newtonian light - bulb calculations of Burrows et al . ( 2012 ) and Dolence et al . ( 2012 ) . The late - time development of SASI - like oscillatory behavior seen in 2D simulations that are initially convection dominated ( e . g . , Marek &amp; Janka 2009 ; B . Müller et al . 2012b ) may thus be an artifact of axisymmetry , but further work is re - quired to solidify this conclusion .</p>

				<p>The next galactic core - collapse supernova will reveal its in - ner workings by means of its neutrino and gravitational - wave ( GW ) signals . Both will provide key insight into the ther - modynamics and multi - D dynamics of the protoneutron star and the postshock region ( e . g . , Ott 2009 ; Lund et al . 2010 , 2012 ; O &apos; Connor &amp; Ott 2013 ) . While our neutrino treatment is too simplistic to yield quantitatively interesting predictions of the neutrino signal , we are in a good position to study the GW emission from accelerated quadrupole mass motions in our models : For the first time , we have extracted GWs from full 3D GR collapse and postbounce core - collapse su - pernova simulations . We find a strong burst of GWs associ - ated with early - postbounce prompt convection with frequen - cies around ∼100 − 200 Hz , a subsequent almost quiescent phase , followed by higher - frequency ( 400 − 1000 Hz ) emis - sion , whose amplitudes are dominated by the deceleration of undershooting convective plumes at the edge of the pro - toneutron star ( cf . Murphy et al . 2009 ) . If convection ( prompt and / or neutrino - driven ) does not develop early , the GW sig - nal would not have a strong initial burst , but rather a slow rise to smaller amplitudes at later times , when the SASI becomes strong . This is a key difference and may allow GW data ana - lysts to distinguish between convection - dominated and SASI - dominated postbounce evolution in the next galactic core - collaspe supernova . The design sensitivities of advanced - generation GW detectors such as Advanced LIGO , Advanced Virgo , or KAGRA are likely to be sufficient to detect the col - lapse and neutrino - driven explosion in our 27 - M progenitor throughout the Milky Way . While different in detail , our re - sults for the GW signature are generally consistent with what was found for other progenitors in the 2D first - principles sim - ulations of Marek et al . ( 2009 ) and Yakunin et al . ( 2010 ) . Our GW signals have higher amplitudes and characteristic fre - quencies than predicted by the 3D simulations of E . Müller et al . ( 2012 ) , who employed an artifical inner boundary that was moved in according to an analytic prescription .</p>

				<p>There are a number of shortcomings and limitations of the simulations presented here that must be mentioned and can be removed only by future work . As is well known and has been pointed out recently by Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) in the core collapse context , in 3D , turbulent power cascades to small scales . Low resolution in 3D may artificially keep power at large scales and may thus lead to an overestimate of the pos - itive effect of neutrino - driven convection . While our effec - tive angular and radial resolution in the postshock gain layer is comparable to the highest resolution considered by Hanke et al . ( 2012 ) , we agree with their assessment that understand - ing the resolution dependence of 3D results is of great impor - tance . We will carry out a resolution study in future work .</p>

				<p>The second major limitation of our simulations is our Carte - sian AMR grid and the fact that we must let the nascent su - pernova shock pass two mesh refinement boundaries before tracking its further evolution by AMR . This induces large perturbations leading to the growth of prompt and neutrino - driven convection in all of our models . These large and essen - tially unavoidable seed perturbations for prompt and neutrino - driven convection make it difficult to draw conclusions on which hydrodynamic instability dominates in the early post - bounce phase . This limitation is shared by other Cartesian AMR schemes . It could possibly be avoided in future work by extending our spherical - polar grid blocks all the way into the protoneutron star core and using a single high - resolution Cartesian mesh only in the innermost few kilometers . Also in future work , we intend to carry out a study in which we map a postbounce profile from a 1D collapse simulation onto our 3D grid after the shock has passed the radii of the inner refinement levels . This should allow us to investigate the role of seed perturbations in a more controlled way .</p>

				<p>A third major limitation of our work is the reliance on our simple gray heating / leakage scheme . While superior to the light - bulb approach , it cannot replace the energy - dependent neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics treatment that has proven to be crucial for reliable conclusions on the neutrino mecha - nism ( e . g . , B . Müller et al . 2012b and references therein ) . The set of 3D general - relativistic hydrodynamics simulations pre - sented here required about ∼20 million CPU hours to com - plete . Adding energy - dependent 3D neutrino transport will increase the computational complexity by an order of mag - nitude . Novel , highly efficient and scalable approaches to 3D neutrino transport will be needed to address this problem ( Sumiyoshi &amp; Yamada 2012 ; Abdikamalov et al . 2012 ; Zhang et al . 2013 ; Radice et al . 2012 ) .</p>

			<note place="foot" n="12"> Both neutrinos and gravitational waves may be direct probes of progenitor properties, supernova dynamics, and of the explosion mechanism. See, e.g., Ott (2009); Lund et al. (2010, 2012); Dasgupta et al. (2010); Brandt et al. (2011); Logue et al. (2012); O&apos;Connor &amp; Ott (2013). arXiv:1210.6674v2 [astro-ph.HE] 25 Mar 2013</note>

			<note place="foot" n="15"> The deviation of the radial velocity is of order unity there, which is readily explained by the extreme variation of vr across the shock and is thus not a reliable measure.</note>
