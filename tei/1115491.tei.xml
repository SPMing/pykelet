				<p>The origin of the form of the quark and lepton mixing matrices and the difference in their textures has been a long-standing puzzle in particle Physics. Its resolution remains elusive and it is one of the top three mysteries of the Standard Model [1, 2]. Explanations of the textures of mixing matrices usually employ introduction of extra dynamics using either extra gauge or discrete degrees of freedom or additional space-time dimensions. Recently a number of attempts have been made to derive a unified framework for lepto-quark mixing. Some recent work explores quark-lepton complementarity [3], TBM-Cabibbo mixing [4], Wolfenstein parameterization for lepton sector [5], the use of</p>

				<p>GUT vector fermions [6], and of &quot; yukawaons &quot; in a version of the flavon approach [7].</p>

				<p>In this letter we derive a common representation for the quark CKM and the lepton PMNS mixing matrices without introduction of additional dynamics. The difference in textures of the two matrices appears as a result of assignment of lepton and quark pairs to different multiplets of a two element discrete symmetry. The symmetry is not present in the Standard Model (SM). It appears if, instead of the Dirac spinors, we use a bi-spinor 2 representation of fermions discovered by Ivanenko and Landau [8], who used it to provide an alternative solution to Dirac&apos;s solution of the electron gyromagnetic problem [9]. We show that the within the context of bi-spinor fermions, which are simply products of two Dirac spinors, in a formalism whose connection to differential geometry was elucidated in [10, 11], mixing matrix textures are unique. Thus we prove a conjecture made in [12, 13, 14] about the common form of mixing for lepto-quarks. Details of the derivations will be given in [15]. We will work within the context of SM4, the sequential extension of the SM to four generations, eventually reducing the number of generations to three in a consistent way. The resulting mixing matrices are non-unitary and exhibit very specific relations between matrix elements. We show that, despite strong constraints, there is no conflict of the form of bispinor induced mixing matrices with the experiment. Our results are unaffected by recent arguments, based on the tentative detection of 125 GeV Higgs [16], that the perturbative fourth generation is ruled out [17]. They apply to the observed mixing matrices, regardless of the existence or non-existence to the fourth generation.</p>

				<p>We begin with presentation of the main result. This will be followed by its justification.</p>

				<p>We will use an explicit example of the quark sector of the SM4 with massive Dirac neutrinos and point out the modifications that must be made in the lepton sector as we go along. Eventually we will set the number of generations to three in a generally covariant way. After spontaneous symmetry breakdown the non-interacting quark part of the SM4 Lagrangian is given by a sum of the kinetic and mass terms</p>

				<p>Since λ -parameters are arbitrary, this mass spectrum is unconstrained. It should be compared with the one derived in [13] 3 . There a less general case with 2 1 q q m m = for quark and lepton sectors was considered, which resulted in unobserved constraints on lepto-quark masses. The particular form (6 -11) of mass matrices for quarks and leptons results in the specific form of SM4 CKM/PMNS mixing matrices. These are obtained from field redefinitions needed to diagonalize (6). Quark mixing matrix is defined as</p>

Lepton mixing matrix is defined analogously as + = L L N E U , where L L N E , enter mass basis transforms ( ) L B AB L L A m e E e = , ( ) L B AB L L A m N ν ν = . We see from (6) that a diagonalizing field redefinition W decomposes into two factors, P B U W W = , where P U removes one of the factors a B in (6), while B W diagonalizes M . It follows from (8 -10) that we must take         = 2 1 0 0 W W W B , (12) where 1 = k W , for neutrinos and ( ) 4 , e e pair, while, if we temporarily switch the 2 = A , 3 = A indexes, for ( ) τ µ, pair and all quark pairs         − = 1 1 1 1 2 1 k W .

				<p>= A row and column with the help of 0 det = Ψ constraint may appear ad hoc done by hand as an afterthought. This is justified to an extent. However, such removal of one generation of four is no more arbitrary then adding two generations by hand as it is done in the Standard Model. Important to realize is that to remove the physical one-particle states of the fourth generation the constraints must be imposed in the mass basis, that is diagonalization of (16) must be carried first.</p>

				<p>, while the latter is the tri-bimaximal (TBM) mixing matrix. We will describe in [14] how the 0 3 ≠ e U in (17) can arise from radiative corrections. We now will explain briefly the choice of the mass matrices in (6 -11). In SM4 it is arbitrary. However, it becomes severely restricted if we rewrite SM4 in terms of bi-spinors. In the four-generation bi-spinor extension of the SM the quark part of the Lagrangian (</p>

				<p>, etc. Note that the last two indexes enter in the kinetic term with negative sign. As a result, it is not possible to extract from (20, 21) mass eigenstates by a diagonalization procedure. Instead one diagonalizes equations of motion. The end effect on mixing matrices is exactly the same as caused by the standard diagonalization procedure in SM4: the left-and the right-lepto-quarks undergo different linear transformations and thus generate mixing. Further, the requirement that masses are positive definite and coincide for left-and the right-handed fermions puts strong constraints on the form of mass matrices. It turns out that up to factors a B , which appear as a result of bringing mass matrices into canonical Cartan form [13,14], there are essentially only five possible forms of M in (6) and hence of mass terms in (21). They correspond to multiplet assignments of lepto-quark pairs according to the value 2 1 , 0 = s of a quantum number, called the scalar spin. One can show that, aside from arbitrary a B factors in (6), the possible tree-level mass terms are given by five cases for M (we refer for details to [15]</p>

				<p>The physical explanation for appearance of scalar spin is that bi-spinors transform in the representation of ( )</p>

				<p>and its conjugate. As a result, when the Dirac spinor degrees of freedom are extracted from bi-spinors using the spinbein decomposition of a bi-spinor into Dirac spinor bilinears [12], the Lagrangian retains a remnant of the &quot; right &quot; spin quantum number introduced in [19]. After the extraction the remnant manifests itself in the form of discrete two-element symmetry of the Lagrangian (20, 21). The symmetry is not present in the SM or SM4. In bi-spinor SM or SM4 it can be used to classify mass eigenstates according to an additional quantum number. Note now that our choice (8 -11) selects case 1 for neutrinos, case 2 for leptons, and case 4 for quarks. Since case 3 is equivalent to case 2 and case 5 is the degenerate version of case 4, the assignment of mass matrices in bi-spinor SM is essentially unique, up to factors a B . It is intriguing that in transition from quarks to leptons the mass symmetry reduction</p>

				<p>. The exception comes from the unitarity constraints that involve tb V . However, the direct measurement of tb V comes with an insufficient precision to test this constraint either. In summary, either the SM or bi-spinor SM could be ruled out if the accuracy of the CKM elements measurements increases by one order of magnitude.</p>
