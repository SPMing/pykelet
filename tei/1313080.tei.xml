				<head>I. INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>Whether a graviton has a mass or not is one of the most fundamental issues in physics.</p>

				<p>In general relativity (GR), it is well-known that the graviton is a massless spin-2 particle . However, Fierz and Pauli proposed a massive spin-2 particle theory, which is known as a unique ghost-free linear massive gravity theory[1]. The present experimental solid constraint on the graviton mass is m &lt; 7.1 × 10 −23 eV [2, 3]. Although a simple non-linear extension of the Fierz-Pauli massive gravity theory contains instabilities called the Boulware-Deser ghost [4], it was shown that the special choice of the interaction term can exclude such a ghost state by de Rham et al[5, 6]. However, this theory cannot describe the flat Friedmann universe, if the fictitious metric for the Stückelberg field is Minkowski&apos;s one. One may consider an inhomogeneous metric or extend it to de Sitter metric. When we discuss an curved fictitious geometry, it may be natural for it to be dynamical.</p>

				<p>In fact the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory has been generalized to such a bigravity theory, which is still ghost-free. It contains a massless spin-2 particle and a massive spin-2 particle [7].</p>

				<p>A phenomenological motivation to consider such theories relates to the discovery of dark energy and dark matter . The cosmological parameters are now determined very precisely [8]. Although standard big-bang cosmology explains many observed data, those observations reveal new unsolved mysteries in cosmology, i.e., dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy, which is the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe, is one of the most mysterious problems in modern cosmology [9]. The acceleration might be due to some unknown matter with a strange equation of state, or might be due to a modification of GR. As for the ghost-free massive gravity or bigravity theory without dark energy, many studies addressed the possibility to explain cosmic acceleration by the &quot; mass &quot; term [10–23].</p>

				<p>In contrast to the massive gravity theory, bigravity theories also have a possibility to explain the origin of dark matter [24]. It is because there are two types of matter field in a bigravity theory. If a matter field interact with both metrics [22, 32, 33], it will violate the equivalence principle, which must hold in very high accuracy [3, 34]. Hence we have to discuss two different matter fields, which are decoupled each other and interact only through two metric interactions. We then call them twin matter fields [35].</p>

				<p>In the previous paper[23], we found that both dark matter and dark energy components in Friedmann equation can be obtained by modification of gravitational theory in the ghost-free bigravity theory . However, dark matter is required not only in the big bang scenario but also in the cosmological structure formation and as dark matter halos existing around galaxies. This paper will show a possibility to explain the origin of dark matter in such situations. The bigravity theory includes GR with/without a cosmological constant as a special case. If both metric are proportional, which we call a homothetic solution, the basic equations are reduced to two sets of the Einstein equations with cosmological constants, which originate from the interaction terms of two metrics [36]. Although two matters must satisfy a fine tuned condition in a homothetic solution, such a solution is an attractor and is obtained asymptotically from more generic initial conditions [23]. The linear perturbations around a homothetic solution are decomposed into two eigenstates: the massless and massive graviton modes. Note that these are the mass eigenstates, whereas they are mixed up in the physical frame described by two metrics. That is, the massless and massive modes couple to both twin matter fluids.</p>

				<p>As a result, the perturbations of our spacetime are described by the linear combinations of the massless and massive modes. Our spacetime is affected by another one of twin matter fluids via the massless and massive graviton modes, and then there is a possibility such that dark matter component is originated by another twin matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate such a possibility . Since dark matter is required in many situations, we shall discuss three typical evidences of dark matter: the content of the Universe, a galactic halo and the cosmic structure formation. The paper is organized as follows. Introducing the ghost-free bigravity, we summarize the basic equations and present a homothetic solution in §II. In §III, we then perform the perturbations around a homothetic solution. We show that dark matter can be obtained from another one of twin matter fluids from a galactic scale to a cosmological scale in §IV. Assuming the Compton wavelength of the massive graviton is shorter than a galactic scale, another twin matter can play a role of dark matter in our world for all scales. We summarize our results and give some remarks in §V. In Appendix A, we evaluate the values of the graviton mass and a cosmological constant for given coupling parameters. We also present the basic equations for the gauge invariant perturbations in a homothetic background solution.</p>

				<head>II. BIGRAVITY THEORY</head>

				<p>A. Hassan-Rosen bigravity model</p>

				<p>In the present papers, we focus on the ghost-free bigravity theory proposed by Hassan and Rosen, which action is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S = 1 2κ 2 g d 4 x √ −gR(g) + 1 2κ 2 f d 4 x −f R(f ) + S [m] (g, f, ψ g , ψ f ) − m 2 κ 2 d 4 x √ −gU (g, f ) , (2.1) where g µν and f µν are two dynamical metrics, and R(g) and R(f ) are those Ricci scalars, respectively. κ 2 g = 8πG and κ 2 f = 8πG are the corresponding gravitational constants , while κ is defined by κ 2 = κ 2 g + κ 2 f .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We assume that the matter action S (m) is divided into two parts: S (m) (g, f, ψ g , ψ f ) = S [m] g (g, ψ g ) + S [m] f (f, ψ f ) , (2.2) i.e., matter fields ψ g and ψ f are coupled only to the gmetric and to the f -metric, respectively. This restriction guarantees the weak equivalence principle. We call the g-matter ψ g and the f -matter ψ f twin matter fluids. The ghost-free interaction term between two metrics is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>U (g, f ) = 4 k=0 b k U k (γ) , (2.3) U 0 (γ) = − 1 4! ǫ µνρσ ǫ µνρσ , U 1 (γ) = − 1 3! ǫ µνρσ ǫ ανρσ γ µ α , U 2 (γ) = − 1 4 ǫ µνρσ ǫ αβρσ γ µ α γ ν β , (2.4) U 3 (γ) = − 1 3! ǫ µνρσ ǫ αβγσ γ µ α γ ν β γ ρ γ , U 4 (γ) = − 1 4! ǫ µνρσ ǫ αβγδ γ µ α γ ν β γ ρ γ γ σ δ , where b k are coupling constants, while γ µ ν is defined by γ µ ρ γ ρ ν = g µρ f ρν . (2.5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In order to take the square root to obtain the explicit form of γ µ ν , we shall introduce the tetrad systems, {e</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(a) µ } and {ω (a) µ }, which are defined by g µν = η ab e (a) µ e (b) ν , f µν = η ab ω (a) µ ω (b) ν , (2.6) with an additional constraint e µ (a) ω µ(b) = e µ (b) ω µ(a) .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This constraint guarantees that the tetrad description is equivalent to the metric description.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>We then find γ µ ν = ǫη ab e µ(a) ω (b) ν , (2.7) where ǫ = ±1 comes from the square root. As for the directions of tetrads, we choose that e (0) µ dx µ and ω (0) µ dx µ are future-directed for dt &gt; 0. Changing the sign of ǫ corresponds to the following transformation γ µ ν ↔ −γ µ ν , (2.8)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>for which the interaction term is invariant by changing the sign of the coupling constants as b k ↔ (−1) k b k (k = 0 − 4) . (2.9)</p>

				<p>Taking the variation of the action with respect to g µν and f µν , we find two sets of the Einstein equations:</p>

(2.12) The γ- &quot; energy-momentum &quot; tensors from the interaction term are given by T [γ]µ ν = m 2 κ 2 (τ µ ν − U δ µ ν ), (2.13) T [γ]µ ν = − √ −g √ −f m 2 κ 2 τ µ ν , (2.14) with τ µ ν = {b 1 U 0 + b 2 U 1 + b 3 U 2 + b 4 U 3 }γ µ ν − {b 2 U 0 + b 3 U 1 + b 4 U 2 }(γ 2 ) µ ν + {b 3 U 0 + b 4 U 1 }(γ 3 ) µ ν − b 4 U 0 (γ 4 ) µ ν .</trash>

From the contracted Bianchi identities for (2.10) and (2.11), the conservation of the γ- &quot; energymomenta &quot; is also guaranteed as (g) ∇ µ T [γ]µ ν = 0 , (f ) ∇ µ T [γ]µ ν = 0 . (2.16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<head>B. Homothetic solution</head>

				<p>First we give one simple solution, in which we assume that two metrics are proportional;</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>f µν = K 2 g µν , (2.17) where K is a scalar function. In this case, since we find the tensor γ µ ν = K δ µ ν , the γ- &quot; energy-momentum &quot; is given by κ 2 g T [γ]µ ν = −Λ g (K)δ µ ν , κ 2 f T [γ]µ ν = −Λ f (K)δ µ ν , where Λ g (K) = m 2 κ 2 g κ 2 b 0 + 3b 1 K + 3b 2 K 2 + b 3 K 3 , Λ f (K) = m 2 κ 2 f κ 2 b 4 + 3b 3 K −1 + 3b 2 K −2 + b 1 K −3 . (2.18)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>From the energy-momentum conservation (2.16), we find that K is a constant. As a result, we find two sets of the Einstein equations with cosmological constants Λ g and Λ f :</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>G µν (g) + Λ g g µν = κ 2 g T [m] µν , (2.19) G µν (f ) + Λ f f µν = κ 2 f T [m] µν . (2.20) Since two metrics are proportional, we have the constraints on the cosmological constants and matter fields as Λ g (K) = K 2 Λ f (K) , (2.21) κ 2 f T [m]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>µν = κ 2 g T [m]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>µν . (2.22)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The quartic equation (2.21) for K has at most four real roots, which give four different cosmological constants . The basic equations (2.19) (or (2.20)) are just the Einstein equations in GR with a cosmological constant . Hence any solutions in GR with a cosmological constant are always the solutions in the present bigravity theory. We shall call these solutions homothetic solutions because of the proportionality of two metrics.</p>

				<head>III. LINEARIZATION OF THE BIGRAVITY THEORY</head>

				<p>A. The perturbations around a homothetic solution The bigravity theory contains both massless and massive spin-2 particles. It becomes clear when we discuss the linear perturbations around a homothetic solution. Note that a homothetic solution is an attractor in a cosmological setting [23]. The unperturbed solution is assumed to be homothetic , i.e.,</p>

					<trash>κ 2 f (0) T [m]µ ν = 1 K 2 κ 2 g (0) T [m]µ ν . (3.4) We then consider the following perturbations: g µν = (0) g µν + h [g] µν , (3.5) f µν = (0) f µν + K 2 h [f ] µν = K 2 (0) g µν + h [f ] µν (3.6) where |h [g]</trash>

				<head>IV. THE ORIGIN OF DARK MATTER</head>

				<p>In this section, we will analyze whether the f -matter field can be dark matter in our g-world. We believe from observation that the evidence of dark matter appears in three situations; (A) dark matter in the Friedmann equation , (B) a dark halo at a galaxy scale, and (C) CDM in cosmic structure formation. So we discuss them in order.</p>

				<p>First we discuss the pie chart of the content of the Universe . The amount of dark matter is about 5 times as large as the baryonic matter. Since we discussed the details of dynamics of the FLRW spacetime and possibility to explain the dark matter component by the f -matter fluid in [23], we give a brief overview here.</p>

				<p>In order to explain the cosmic pie, we consider the homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, which metrics are</p>

				<p>and N f are lapse function, while a g and a f are scale factors for g µν and f µν , respectively. Using the gauge freedom, we can set N g = 1 without loss of generality. For generic initial data, the ratios N f /N g and a f /a g can approach to the same constant K given by (2.21), as the universe expands, i.e., the homothetic solution is an attractor in the present system. The dynamical time scale is about m −1 eff . As a result, near the attractor, i.e., near the present stage of the universe, the evolution of the universe is described by the effective Freidmann equation</p>

(4.10) To analyze the gravitational fields of a galaxy, we consider static Newtonian potentials Φ g and Φ f formed by non-relativistic mass densities ρ g and ρ f . From the 0-0 component of Eq.

				<p>∂ i is the usual three-dimensional Laplacian operator and Φ − = −h [−] 00 /2 is the gravitational potential of the massive mode. The factor 4/3 comes from van Dam-Veltmann-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity [38]. Note that the source term is described by the difference of two mass densities, and then it can be negative.

This is main difference from the Newtonian gravity theory. It may makes a possibility such that the f -matter can behave as dark matter in the g-worlds.</p>

				<p>In a small scale such as the solar system, however, GR must be restored because GR has been well confirmed by the experiments and observations[3]. The restoration can be realized via the so-called Vainshtein mechanism [39]. In this range (below the Vainshtein radius), the linear perturbation approach is broken down, and then non-linear effects must be taken into account. However, when GR is restored from the bigravity theory, the effect on the g-world from the f -matter fluid must be screened [40]. It indicates that the f -matter cannot be dark matter below the Vainshtein radius. Since we are interested in whether the f -matter plays a role of dark matter in the g-world, we shall only analyze the linear perturbations. The evaluation of the Vainshtein radius will be given in the last part of this subsection.

				<p>Since we are interested in formation of galaxies, we discuss only sub-horizon scale perturbations, a/k ≪ H −1 .</p>

				<p>In this subsection, we first analyze the linear perturbation equations numerically. We assume that the matter component is dominated by non-relativistic matter (w = 0).

				<p>The Compton wavelength m −1 eff is larger than the horizon scale H −1 for (a), while the relation is opposite for (b) and (c).

Note that it was shown that in the bigravity theory there exists a gradient instability against linear cosmological perturbations in the massless limit [42–44]. The non-linear effect must be taken into ac- count. When m −1 eff &lt; H −1 (the case (b) and (c)), there are two important time scales: One is the Hubble expansion time H −1 , and the other is the oscillation time scale of the massive graviton m −1 eff .

Hence the coefficient of the left hand side of (4.35) eventually vanishes when we go back to the past, while the right hand side does not usually vanish simultaneously. It indicates that the linear perturbation approximation is broken at the time when the coefficient of the left hand side vanishes because h (L) − must diverge. In this epoch, to answer for the question whether there still exists an adiabatic potential solution as an attractor, we have to analyze the full dynamical equations with inhomogeneities, which is quite difficult without heavy numerical simulation. However, there is some hope from Eq. (4.35), which shows a possibility such that the density perturbation is still small enough to be treated as linear perturbation even when the metric perturbations become nonlinear. In a spherically symmetric case, we find an adiabatic potential solution with nonlinear metric perturbations but with linear matter perturbations[46]. In this solution, we claim that the Vainshtein mechanism is working even in a cosmological context, and the solution can be described by GR. Hence we may conceive the following scenario, although the present analysis is based on the perturbations around a homothetic solution and an extended analysis with more generic background such as that in [43] will be required. In the early stage of the universe, because of the Vainshtein mechanism, gravity is described by GR and then the standard big bang scenario is found. However the Universe eventually evolves into the bigravity phase at H −1 ∼ m −1 eff as shown in Fig. 3. When the universe reaches the decoupling time, we find the case (b) or (c) for the perturbations, in which the adiabatic potential approximation becomes valid as an attractor. Hence FIG. 3</p>

The perturbation of dark matter component coincides with that of the f -matter, i.e., δ D ≈ δ f , (4.45) for a/k ≫ m −1 eff . Therefore, the f -matter perturbation behaves as the dark matter component in the g-world as §. IV A and §. IV B. Inside the Compton wavelength, the f -matter acts as a repulsive force as shown in §.

We assume δ g = 10 −5 and δ f = 10 −1 at the decoupling time (a = 10 −3 ). For the large scale perturbation, its scale is always larger than the Compton wavelength after the decoupling time. Hence the f -matter plays the role of dark matter in the g-world and helps small baryon perturbation δ g to grow rapidly as shown in Fig. 4 (a).

				<head>V. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head>

				<p>We have studied a possibility to explain a dark matter component by another one of twin matter fluids in the ghost free bigravity theory. We have analyze from a galactic scale to a cosmological scale. If we assume the Compton wavelength of the massive graviton is shorter than a galactic scale, i.e., a graviton mass is rather heavy (m eff ∼ 10 −27 eV), we find a dark matter component can be explained by another twin matter for all scales. For such a model, our matter field consists just of baryons. The origin of dark matter field is another matter field which couples only to another metric.</p>

				<p>For such a model, at first glance, it seems that the cosmic acceleration cannot be explained by the interaction term, because the expected cosmological constant is also large. As shown in Appendix A (see Table I), however, we can find a large graviton mass and a small cosmological constant although we need a fine-tuning of the coupling parameters. For such fine-tuned coupling parameters , the ghost-free bigravity theory could explain dark matter as well as dark energy. Our analysis is valid only for the late stage of the Universe , because the background space is assumed to be homothetic. In order to find a whole history of the Universe , we have to analyze more generic background spacetime with perturbations. We also have to show that the Vainshtein mechanism does really work in the early stage of the Universe as we conceived. Those are in progress.</p>

				<p>Our result shows the graviton mass is phenomenologically significant. The bigravity theory can explain only dark energy for m −1 eff ∼ Gpc, while if m −1 eff kpc it could explain dark matter (as well as dark energy). Therefore, an important remaining question is how large graviton mass is possible from the theoretical and observational points of view. From the theoretical point of view, we should start from more fundamental theory in which a bigravity theory is reduced as a low-energy effective theory [47–49]. We hope that the hierarchy between the graviton mass and an effective cosmological constant to explain both dark sectors will be solved in such a fundamental theory. From the observational point of view, the evidence of a graviton mass could be detected by gravitational waves [3, 50]. Furthermore, comparing some bigravity phenomena with the observational data in a galactic scale as well as in a cosmological scale, we may find the constraint of the graviton mass (e.g. gravitational lensing by galaxies [51]). In order to clarify whether the graviton really has a mass and give a constraint on its value, further studies are required.</p>

				<p>The effective cosmological constant and the graviton mass are given by (2.18) and (3.14), which contain many unknown or unfixed values of coupling constants. In order to discuss the evolution of the Universe, we have first to evaluate the values of the graviton mass and the cosmological constant for given coupling constants. For this purpose, it is more convenient to introduce another set of coupling constants {c k }(k = 0, 1, · · · , 4) by rewriting the interaction term in term of another tensor defined by K</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>µ ν = δ µ ν − γ µ ν as U (g, f ) = 4 k=0 c k U k (K) . (A1)</trash>

					<figDesc>The relations between {b k } and {c k } are given by</figDesc>
					<trash>c 0 = b 0 + 4b 1 + 6b 2 + 4b 3 + b 4 , c 1 = −(b 1 + 3b 2 + 3b 3 + b 4 ), c 2 = b 2 + 2b 3 + b 4 , (A2) c 3 = −(b 3 + b 4 ), c 4 = b 4 .</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We assume that a flat Minkowski spacetime exists in the present bigravity model. Then we impose the following conditions:</p>

				<p><formula>c 0 = c 1 = 0 . (A3)</formula></p>

				<p>If m is assumed to be the graviton mass in the Minkowski background in massive gravity limit, we should set c 2 = −1 . (A4)</p>

				<p>As a result, {b k } are described by two free coupling constants c 3 and c 4 as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>b 0 = 4c 3 + c 4 − 6, b 1 = 3 − 3c 3 − c 4 , b 2 = 2c 3 + c 4 − 1, (A5) b 3 = −(c 3 + c 4 ), b 4 = c 4 . These coupling constants guarantee m 2 eff | K=1 = m 2 , Λ g | K=1 = Λ f | K=1 = 0 , (A6)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>for the Minkowski background with K = 1.</p>

				<p>In order to explain dark energy, de Sitter spacetime must be an attractor solution. As shown in [23, 52], the quartic equation (2.21) gives one de Sitter solution with K = K dS as well as two anti de Sitter solutions, if 2c 2 3 + 3c 4 &gt; 0 . (A7)</p>

				<p>Since the Higuchi bound must be satisfied[53], the lower bound of the graviton mass is given by the cosmological constant as</p>

				<p><formula>m 2 eff &gt; 2 3 Λ g .</formula></p>

				<p>If we consider a simple and natural case, i.e., b k ∼ O(1) (or c k ∼ O(1)) and κ g ∼ κ f , we find the cosmological constant and the graviton mass as Λ g ∼ m 2 m eff ∼ m (A8) for K = K dS , assuming no fine-tuning of the coupling constants.</p>

				<p>In this case, dark energy fixes the value of Λ g , and then m −1 (the Compton wave length) must be the cosmological horizon scale H −1 . As a result, the massive mode becomes important for a sub-horizon scale such as a galaxy. In this case, the f -matter does not explain dark matter, because it is in the GR phase. In order for the f -matter to be dark matter, m eff ∼ m is too light. As we show in §. IV, if m eff ∼ 1 kpc, the f -matter can play a role of dark matter. However, in that case, Λ g is too large to explain the cosmic acceleration, except for the K = 0 branch with a different origin of dark energy. Is there any possibility such that Λ g ∼ H −1 but m eff ∼ 1 kpc ? We then look for the possibility of a heavy graviton mass, i.e. Λ g ≪ m 2 eff . One way to get a heavy graviton mass as well as a small cosmological constant is to assume κ</p>

				<p><formula>2 g ≫ κ 2 f or κ 2 f ≫ κ 2 g .</formula></p>

				<p>If we have such a hierarchy between two gravitational constants, we find Λ g ≪ m 2 eff without fine-tuning of coupling constants {c i }. Otherwise, we have to fine-tune the coupling constants.</p>

				<p>Fine-tuning the coupling constants such that</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>0 &lt; 2c 2 3 + 3c 4 ≪ 1 , we find a small effective cosmological constant (Λ g ≪ m 2 eff ∼ m 2</trash>

					<figDesc>). We show some examples in Table I.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>TABLE I: The ratios of the cosmological constant to the graviton mass square. We assume c3 = −1.</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>κ 2 g /κ 2 f 2c 2 3 + 3c4 K dS Λg/m 2 eff m 2 g /m 2 f 1 1 5.08 0.0815 25.8 10 −12 1 8.85 5.11 × 10 −11 7.84 × 10 −11 1 10 −12 4.00 9.34 × 10 −14 16.0 10 −6 10 −6 4.00 8.10 × 10 −11 1.60 × 10 −5</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>As a result, although the graviton mass square and the cosmological constant are ordinarily the same as m 2 eff ∼ Λ g , it is possible to find a much heavier graviton mass compared with the observed cosmological constant.</p>

				<p>Appendix B: Cosmological linear perturbations</p>

				<p>In this Appendix, we shortly summarize the linear perturbations of a flat FLRW universe in the bigravity theory[41]. Just for simplicity, we assume that the background metrics are given by the homothetic flat FLRW spacetimes. The detail analysis for more generic background spacetime including vector and tensor modes was discussed in [43].</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>The background homothetic flat FLRW spacetimes are given by</figDesc>
					<trash>(0) g µν dx µ dx ν = −dt 2 + a 2 (t)δ ij dx i dx j , (B1) (0) f µν = K 2 (0) g µν . (B2)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>This background solution is determined by the standard Friedmann equation with a cosmological constant and the following constraints must be satisfied:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>κ 2 g (0) T [m]µ ν = K 2 κ 2 f (0) T [m]µ ν , (B3) Λ g = K 2 Λ f . (B4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>We then consider the adiabatic scalar perturbations and ignore an anisotropic stress.</p>

				<p>The perturbed metrics are expressed as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>g 00 = −(1 + 2α g Y ) , g 0i = −aβ (L) g Y i , g ij = a 2 (δ ij + 2h (L) g δ ij Y + 2h (T ) g Y ij ) , (B5) f 00 = −K 2 (1 + 2α f Y ) , f 0i = −K 2 aβ (L) f Y i , f ij = K 2 a 2 (δ ij + 2h (L) f δ ij Y + 2h (T ) f Y ij ) , (B6) while the perturbed energy-momentum tensors are given by T 0 0 = − ¯ ρ g (1 + δ g ) , T 0 i = a(¯ ρ g + ¯ P g )(v (L) g − β (L) g )Y i , T i 0 = −a −1 (¯ ρ g + ¯ P g )v (L) g Y i , T i j = P g (δ i j + π (L) g δ i j ) , (B7) T 0 0 = − ¯ ρ f (1 + δ f ) , T 0 i = a(¯ ρ f + ¯ P f )(v (L) f − β (L) f )Y i , T i 0 = −a −1 (¯ ρ f + ¯ P f )v (L) f Y i , T i j = P f (δ i j + π (L) f δ i j ) , (B8) where the scalar harmonic function Y is defined by (∆ + k 2 )Y = 0 , (B9) with −k 2</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>being an eigenvalue of the usual threedimensional Laplacian operator ∆, and its vector and tensor harmonic functions are defined by:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Y i = −k −1 ∂ i Y , Y ij = k −2 ∂ i ∂ j − 1 3 δ ij ∂ a ∂ a Y , (B10) respectively. The perturbation variables {α g/f , β (L) g/f , h (L) g/f , h (T ) g/f } and {δ g/f , v (L) g/f , π (L) g/f } depend only on time. The unperturbed energy densities and pressures, { ¯ ρ g/f , ¯ P g/f }, must satisfy κ 2 g ¯ ρ g = K 2 κ 2 f ¯ ρ f , κ 2 g ¯ P g = K 2 κ 2 f ¯ P f . (B11)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>For the perturbation variables in the g-world, we can define the gauge invariant variables as in GR:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ g = α g − ˙ σ (L) g , Ψ g = R g − Hσ (L) g , ∆ g = δ g + 3(1 + w) a k H(β (L) g − v (L) g ) g , V g = v (L) g + a k ˙ h (T ) g , (B12) where w = ¯ P g / ¯ ρ g , c 2 s = ˙ ¯ P g / ˙ ¯ ρ g . (B13)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>R g and σ g are the curvature and the shear perturbations, respectively, which are defined by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>R g = h (L) g + 1 3 h (T ) g , (B14) σ (L) g = a 2 k 2 ˙ h (T ) g − a k β (L) g . (B15)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Similarly, we introduce the gauge invariant variables in the f -world, which are defined by those with the subscript f . We note w and c 2 s coincide in the g-and f worlds because of (B11). The massless and massive mode perturbations, X + and X − , are described by the linear combination of the perturbed variables in the g-and f -worlds, X g and X f , as</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>X + = m 2 f m 2 eff X g + m 2 g m 2 eff X f , (B16) X − = X g − X f , (B17) or inversely X g = X + + m 2 g m 2 eff X − , (B18) X f = X + − m 2 f m 2 eff X − . (B19) For the massless mode, there are four independent equations − k 2 a 2 Φ + = κ 2 g ¯ ρ g 2 ∆ + (B20) Φ + + Ψ + = 0 , (B21) ˙ ∆ + − 3wH∆ + + (1 + w) k a V + = 0, (B22) and ˙ V + + HV + − k a c 2 s ∆ + 1 + w + Φ + = 0 , (B23)</trash>

					<figDesc>for four perturbation variables {Φ + , Ψ + , ∆ + , V + }.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>If both background matter densities (¯ ρ g and ¯ ρ f ) are dominated by non-relativistic matter (w = 0), the equation for the density perturbation ∆ + is given by</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>¨ ∆ + + 2H ˙ ∆ + + k 2 c 2 s a 2 − κ 2 g ρ g 2 ∆ + = 0 , (B24)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which is the same as that in GR. Then we will not discuss it furthermore. Unlike the massless mode, there are six independent equations of motion for the massive mode variables {α − , β</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(L) − , h (L) − , h (T ) − , δ − , v (L)</trash>

					<figDesc>− }. By use of Φ − , Ψ − , which are given by the above six variable, we find the similar four equations to those of the massless mode as</figDesc>
					<trash>− k 2 a 2 Φ − + m 2 eff 3 2 h (L) − + 3 4 a k Hβ (L) − + h (T ) − = κ 2 g ¯ ρ g 2 ∆ − , (B25) Φ − + Ψ − = m 2 eff a 2 k 2 h (T ) − , (B26) ˙ ∆ − − 3wH∆ − + (1 + w) k a V − + 3 4 (1 + w)m 2 eff a k β (L) − = 0, (B27) ˙ V − + HV − − k a c 2 s ∆ − 1 + w + Φ − = 0, (B28)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>in which the extra terms come from the interactions between two metrics. In addition, we have two more independent equations from (</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>3.21) as 6 ˙ h (L) − + 6Hh (L) − − 6Hα − + k a β (L) − = 0 , (B29) a k 3 2 ˙ β (L) − + 6Hβ (L) − + 3α − + 6h (L) − + 2h (T ) − = 0 . (B30)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Note that although the massive mode variables are gauge invariant in themselves, we also use Φ − , Ψ − , ∆ − and V − just for the similar description to those of the massless mode.</p>

				<p>Once the equation of state are given, since the above six dynamical equations are independent, we can solve the six variables {α − , β</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(L) − , h (L) − , h (T ) − , δ − , v (L)</trash>

					<figDesc>− } for given appropriate initial data.</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In order to set up initial data, we have the additional constraint equations:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(3m 2 eff − 2Λ g ) α − + 3h (L) − = κ 2 g ¯ ρ g δ − − 3wπ (L) − − (1 + 3w)α − + 3(1 − w)h (L) − , (B31) − HΦ − + ˙ Ψ − = a k ˙ HV − + 1 4 m 2 eff a k β (L) − . (B32)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>which are obtained from (3.22) and 0-i component of the Einstein equations.</p>

				<p>From the above basic equations, we find that the variables consist of two parts: One is an oscillating wave part and the other is a monotonically changing part in time.</p>

				<p>As an example, we show the equation for h</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(T ) − : ¨ h (T ) − + 3H ˙ h (T ) − + k 2 a 2 + m 2 eff h (T ) − = − k 2 a 2 α − + 3h (L) − + 12H ˙ h (L) − + Hh (L) − − Hα − ≈ − k 2 a 2 α − + 3h (L) − for a k ≪ H −1 . (B33) This equation naively shows that h (T )</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>− oscillates with the frequency ω ∼ k 2 /a 2 + m 2 eff with the damping amplitude due to the expansion of the universe (H). Although the right hand side may work as a source term, which could increase the amplitude, it is not the case as we show it numerically. As a result, the metric variable will approach a monotonically changing part with damping oscillations.</p>
