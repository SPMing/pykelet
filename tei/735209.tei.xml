				<p>We show that it is possible to formulate the most general first-class gauge algebra of the operator formalism by only using BRST-invariant constraints. In particular, we extend a previous construction for irreducible gauge algebras to the reducible case. The gauge algebra induces two nilpotent, Grassmann-odd, mutually anticommuting BRST operators that bear structural similarities with BRST/anti-BRST theories but with shifted ghost number assignments. In both cases we show how the extended BRST algebra can be encoded into an operator master equation. A unitarizing Hamiltonian that respects the two BRST symmetries is constructed with the help of a gauge-fixing Boson. Abelian reducible theories are shown explicitly in full detail, while non-Abelian theories are worked out for the lowest reducibility stages and ghost momentum ranks.</p>

				<head n="1">Introduction</head>

				<p>In the quantization of a classical system with first-class constraints T α , {T α , T β } P B = U αβ γ T γ , (1.1) it is well-known that there may appear quantum anomalies in the expression for the operator commutator [T α , T β ] at quadratic (or higher) orders in ¯ h. A useful approach to circumvent this obstacle, is, to replace the initial constraints T α with BRST-invariant constraints T α . In practice, it turns out that the BRST invariance of T α protects the commutator [T α , T β ] against anomalies. Our goal is to investigate this fact systematically in a general setting. For irreducible first class constraint such an investigation is undertaken in Ref. [1]. Here we will develop that construction and extend it to reducible gauge algebras.</p>

				<p>The use of BRST-invariant constraints is best illustrated by a motivating example. Consider the critical open Bosonic string theory in D = 26 dimensions with an intercept/normal-ordering constant a = 1, cf. Ref. [2], Ref. [3]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>and Appendix A. The matter Virasoro generators T m = 1 2 η µν n : α µ m−n α ν n : −¯ haδ 0 m (1.2) form a Virasoro algebra with non-zero central extension [T m , T n ] = ¯ h(m−n)T m+n + ¯ h 2 A m δ 0 m+n , (1.3) A m ≡ Dm(m 2 − 1) 12 + 2ma . (1.4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The remedy is well-known: When one adds the appropriate ghost contributions T</p>

					<trash>(c) m to the Virasoro constraints, T m = T m + T (c) m , T (c) m = n (m−n) : b m+n c −n : (1.5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>the new constraints T m obey a Virasoro algebra with no central extension, also known as a Witt algebra, precisely for D = 26 and a = 1, [T m</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>, T n ] = ¯ h(m−n)T m+n + ¯ h 2 A m δ 0 m+n , (1.6) A m ≡ (D − 26)m 3 + (24a + 2 − D)m 12 = 0 . (1.7)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>How does the BRST formulation [4, 5] fit into this? Surprisingly, the new anomaly-free constraints T m happen to be BRST-superpartners of the ghosts momenta b m ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>T m = 1 ¯ h [b m , Ω 0 ] , (1.8) where Ω 0</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>denotes the BRST operator. As a simple consequence of eq. (1.8), the new constraints T m are BRST-invariant, [T m , Ω 0 ] = 1 ¯ h [[b m , Ω 0 ], Ω 0 ] = 1 2¯ h [b m , [Ω 0 , Ω 0 ]] = 0 . (1.9)</p>

				<p>Here we argue that eq. (1.8) should be viewed as the rule rather than the exception. First of all, eq. (1.8) respects ghost number conservation, since Ω 0 , T m and b m carry ghost number 1, 0 and −1, respectively. In general, ghost number conservation severely restricts what can happen. Secondly, it follows from eq. (1.8), using quite broad assumptions, that the [T m , T n ] commutator cannot develop a quantum anomaly, which is a strong hint. For instances, guided by ghost number conservation, it is reasonable to expect that the commutator [T m , b n ] between the BRST-invariant constraints T m and the ghost momenta b n again is proportional to the ghost momenta. In detail, let us assume that [T m , b n ] =</p>

				<p><formula>¯ h p U mn p b p (1.10)</formula></p>

				<p>for some BRST-invariant structure functions U mn p . Then the proof goes as follows: [T m</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>, T n ] = 1 ¯ h [T m , [b n , Ω 0 ]] = 1 ¯ h [[T m , b n ], Ω 0 ] = p U mn p [b p , Ω 0 ] = ¯ h p U mn p T p , (1.11) i.e. there are no terms of order O(¯ h 2 ). Therefore the eqs. (1.8) and (1.10) imply that the [T m , T n ]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>commutator is anomaly-free. Such an assurance is a rare commodity in a full-fledged quantum theory, and this is why we would like to systematically seek for relationships of the form (1.8). (In string theory much more is known: The ghost momentum b(z) = m b m z −m−2 is a primary field of conformal weight 2, which means that [T m , b n ] = ¯ h(m−n)b m+n , thereby confirming the Ansatz (1.10) with U mn p = (m−n)δ p n+m . However, we emphasize the versatility of the argument.) Later in the construction a new generation of ghosts C A is introduced, and the BRST-doublets T A = {T m ; b m } (1.12) are turned into twice as many first-class constraints for a new BRST operator called Ω 1 = C A T A + . . ., cf. eq. (3.41) below.</p>

				<p>We stress that choosing BRST-invariant constraints T α is not a miraculous cure that turns anomalous theories into anomaly-free ones. Rather it is a useful tool in overcoming a poor initial choice of constraint basis T α for otherwise sound theories. For instance, in the case of critical open Bosonic strings, the BRST formulation requires – for starters – that the BRST charge Ω 0 is nilpotent,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>0 = [Ω 0 , Ω 0 ] = m,n ([T m , T n ] − ¯ h(m−n)T m+n )c −m c −n = ¯ h 2 m A m c −m c m , (1.13) which by itself implies the familiar D = 26 and a = 1, cf. eqs. (1.7) and (A.10). In general, we shall simply assume as a starting point that an anomaly-free nilpotent BRST operator Ω 0 has been given. (For a typical physical model with infinitely many degrees of freedom, it takes a fair amount of mathematical analysis to rigorously establish this beyond the formal level [6, 7, 8]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>.)</p>

				<p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the standard Hamiltonian BRST construction [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] is reviewed. In Section 3 a new generation of ghosts and BRST symmetry is introduced. An anti-BRST operator is used to infer cohomologically the existence of an S operator, which satisfies an operator master equation [11], [S, [S, Ω]] = (i¯ h)[S, Ω] , (1.14) cf. eq. (3.63) below. The S operator contains the so-called tilde constraints T A , which are the analogues of the above string ghost momenta b m , and which descend via the relation</p>

				</figure>

				<p>) and is the heart of the construction. It guarantees that the new T A 0 constraints are BRST-invariant up to the first term on the left-hand side, which depends on ghost momenta and vanishes in the unitary limit. In short, Section 3 presents the various pieces and definitions that go into the construction. In Section 4 we assemble all the pieces and show how to gauge-fix, i.e. construct the unitarizing Hamiltonian. One of our main new points is that the construction shares strikingly many similarities with BRST/anti-BRST symmetric models. In particular, it has two nilpotent, Grassmann-odd, mutually anticommuting BRST operators, although their ghost number assignments are different. Here the first BRST operator Ω is a ghostdeformed version of the ordinary BRST operator Ω 0 , and the second BRST operator is the new BRST operator Ω 1 , associated with a next generation of ghosts C A , cf. eq. (1.12). Similar to BRST/anti- BRST theories, the gauge-fixing will depend on a gauge-fixing Boson, and the unitarizing Hamiltonian will respect both BRST symmetries.</p>

				<p>In Section 5 the Abelian case is treated in full details. The Abelian case, which besides being an important example in its own right, establishes at the theoretical level the existence of the whole construction . Later, in Section 6 we discuss algebraic properties of the constraints. Section 7 briefly states our conclusions. The paper also includes five appendices: Appendix A gives an elementary derivation of the conformal anomaly for the critical open Bosonic string. Appendix B and Appendix C discuss an optional superfield and matrix formulation, respectively. The superfield formulation explores a (perfectly consistent) ghost number deficit among the two superpartners of new constraints T A , as already evident from eq. (1.12). Finally, Appendix D analyzes possible candidates for the operator master eq. (1.14), and Appendix E reformulates certain additional involution relations as a nilpotency condition for a BRST operator.</p>

				<head n="1.1">Operator Ordering</head>

				<p>String theory is most often formulated using elementary Fock space creation and annihilation operators , α µ m , b m and c m , also referred to as Wick operators. The ordering prescription is Wick (=normal) ordering, cf. eqs. (A.2) and (A.3); and the Hermitian conjugation is implemented through opposite modes m ↔ −m,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>(α µ m ) † = α µ −m , b † m = b −m , c † m = c −m . (1.16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>However for a general theory, one does not want to make unnecessary assumptions about the index structure of the fundamental operators, and one would therefore have to write the Hermitian conjugation &quot; † &quot; explicitly, thereby producing quite lengthy formulas. To avoid this, we take from now on the fundamental operators to be Hermitian or anti-Hermitian, and the ordering prescription to be qp-ordering, i.e. the coordinates q ordered to the left of the momenta p. (In the sectors of the theory that is not written out explicitly, one is of course free to assume any ordering.) For more on the Wick formalism and the string example, see Subsection 6.B of Ref. [12] and Subsection 6.2 of Ref. [1]</p>

As usual, the normalized commutator (1.18) becomes a Poisson bracket {A, B} P B of commuting functions A and B in the classical limit ¯ h → 0 by the well-known correspondence principle of quantum mechanics. However, we stress that the normalized commutator (1.18) is an operator for ¯ h = 0. The notation (1.18) enables us to 1) almost eliminate appearances of i¯ h, 2) provide a full-fledged quantum operator formalism and 3) at the same time give classical expressions. Note that {A; B} separated by a semicolon &quot; ; &quot; instead of a comma &quot; , &quot; will denote a set of two elements A and B.</p>

				<p>As a rule of thumb, calligraphic letters are associated with the new ghost sector, cf. Subsection 3.1. A bar &quot; − &quot; over a quantity refers to negative ghost number, while a tilde &quot; ∼ &quot; (resp. breve &quot; ⌣ &quot; ) over a quantity means that it is associated with S 1 (resp. S 2 ), cf. Subsection 3.7 (resp. 3.8).</p>

				<head n="2">Old BRST Algebra</head>

				<p>In this Section 2 we review the construction of a general BRST operator algebra [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16] with the operator ordering prescription taken to be qp-ordering. The review is partially to fix notation and partially to motivate later constructions. The BRST algebra will only serve as a starting point, and we shall refer to it as the &quot; old &quot; or the &quot; ordinary &quot; system to distinguish it from newer sectors to be added in later Sections.</p>

The logic behind reducible gauge algebras, is, that due to requirements of locality and symmetries, such as e.g. Lorentz symmetry, it is impossible to pick an irreducible set of constraints. At each stage s (except the last stage) one keeps overshooting the number of remaining gauge symmetries. In detail, the s&apos;th stage consists of m s = γ s +γ s+1 ghosts, which corresponds to γ s independent gauge symmetries, and γ s+1 redundant symmetries, which in turn become gauge symmetries for the next stage s+1.

				<p>Contrary to the standard approach [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] one does not introduce non-minimal variables in the old sector.

				<head n="2.4">Anti-BRST algebra</head>

				<p>At this point we mention an interesting possibility to include an anti-BRST operator ¯ Ω 0 = ¯ Ω 0 (q, p; C, ¯ P ). Although anti-BRST algebras are not an essential part of this paper (i.e. one is free to simply let ¯ Ω 0 = 0), they nevertheless constitute an important topic that is worthwhile mentioning. In general, the anti-BRST operator ¯ Ω 0 is required to satisfy</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We caution that the pertinent anti-BRST algebra [21] will here be different from the traditional notion of an anti-BRST algebra [22, 23, 24]. Recall that in the traditional setting, the anti-BRST algebra explores an Sp(2) duality among the Faddeev-Popov ghost and antighost C α ↔ ¯ C α . Roughly speaking, the traditional anti-BRST operator (which are closely related to a co-BRST operator [25]) amounts to substitute C α → ¯ C α in Ω 0 , while keeping the constraints T α the same. However in our current setup, there is no Faddeev-Popov antighost within the minimal framework; only a ghost momenta ¯ P α . (Instead the Faddeev-Popov antighost typically belongs to a non-minimal sector.) The crucial difference is that the traditional Sp(2) doublets (C α ; ¯ C β ) of Faddeev-Popov ghost pairs commute [C α , ¯ C β ] = 0, while the canonical pairs (C α ; ¯ P β ) do not commute. Also the anti-constraints ¯ T α 0 in ¯ Ω 0 will in general be different from the first-class constraints T α 0 , cf. eq. (2.38) below. In detail, the ¯ Ω 0 operator is a power series expansion in ordinary ghosts C and ¯ P , and ordered according to the</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We have up until now mostly reviewed the notions of BRST and anti-BRST symmetry in the Hamiltonian setting. In the next Subsections 2.5-2.7 we shall make a series of new observations concerning the cohomology of Ω 0 , which lead to an operator master equation, cf. eq. (2.42) below. There is a parallel operator master eq. (3.63) for the main construction, to be presented in Section 3.</p>

				<p>Normally it is assumed that the cohomology of {Ω 0 , ·} is trivial in sectors of non-vanishing ghost number. Then the Ω 0</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>closeness (2.24) of ¯ Ω 0 implies that ¯ Ω 0 is Ω 0 -exact, i.e. there exists a Bosonic operator S −2 such that ¯ Ω 0 = {Ω 0 , S −2 } , ε(S −2 ) = 0 , gh(S −2 ) = − 2 . (2.36)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In detail, the S −2 operator is a power series expansion in the ordinary ghosts C</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>and ¯ P , S −2 = 1 2 A β 0 α 0 ¯ P α 0 ¯ P β 0 (−1) ε α 0 + A α 1 ¯ P α 1 (−1) ε α 1 + O(C ¯ P ) , (2.37) where A α 0 β 0 = −(−1) ε α 0 ε β 0 A β 0 α 0 and A α 1 are arbitrary operators. For instance, the complete ¯ T α 0 solution to eq. (2.33) alone, is ¯ T γ 0 = 1 2 A β 0 α 0 Z α 0 β 0 γ 0 + A α 1 Z α 1 γ 0 , (2.38) where Z α 0 β 0 γ 0 is defined in eq. (2.19). 2.6 The S −4 Operator</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Similarly, one may define an S −4 operator as follows. First note that the antibracket (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 of S −2 with itself can be written as the commutator of S −2 and ¯</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Ω 0 , (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 = {S −2 , {Ω 0 , S −2 }} = {S −2 , ¯ Ω 0 } . (2.39) The antibracket (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 is Ω 0 -closed, as the following calculation shows, {Ω 0 , (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 } = {Ω 0 , {S −2 , ¯ Ω 0 }} = {{Ω 0 , S −2 }, ¯ Ω 0 } = { ¯ Ω 0 , ¯ Ω 0 } = 0 , (2.40) since ¯ Ω 0 is Ω 0 -closed and nilpotent, cf. eq. (2.24). Hence the antibracket (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 is Ω 0 -exact, i.e. there exists a quantity S −4 , such that 1 2 (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 = {Ω 0 , S −4 } , ε(S −4 ) = 0 , gh(S −4 ) = − 4 . (2.41) 2.7 Operator Master Equation</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The process of finding higher and higher cohomology relations may be automated by introducing an operator master equation −(S, S) Ω 0 ≡ {S, {S, Ω 0 }} = Ω 0 . (2.42)</p>

				<p>To define the operator S, one first let a quantity S 0 be the ghost operator, S 0 = G , (2.43) see eq. (3.10) below. Furthermore, one may show by mathematical induction that there exist quantities S −2k for each positive integer k ≥ 1, and with quantum numbers ε(S −2k ) = 0 , gh(S −2k ) = − 2k , (2.44) such that the sum</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S ≡ ∞ k=0 S −2k , ε(S) = 0 , (2.45)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>of indefinite ghost number, satisfies the above operator master eq. (2.42), cf. Appendix D. The master eq. (2.42) is really an infinite tower of equations. The first non-trivial equation is eq. (2.41).</p>

				<p>Although we shall not pursue this here, let us mention that a stronger formulation of the anti-BRST algebra would impose rank conditions on ¯ Ω 0 (i.e. the analogues of conditions (2.10)-(2.12) for Ω 0 ), and the anti-BRST algebra would contain non-trivial information, which allows for a complexification the whole BRST algebra. For starters, the dimension m s must then be even at each stage s ∈ {0, . . . , L}.</p>

				<p>In contrast, there are no such requirements for a traditional Sp(2) algebra.</p>

					<figDesc>In addition there are non-minimal variables, which we will often not write explicitly in formulas for the sake of simplicity, cf. Subsection 4.2. Technically, the various expansions will be kept under control by a bi-graded mesh of integer-graded conservation laws, which (besides the usual ghost number conservation) includes a new ghost number grading, denoted &quot; ngh &quot; . The Grassmann parity and new ghost number of the new ghosts are</figDesc>
					<trash>ε(C A ) = ε A +1 = ε( ¯ P A ) , ε(C As ) = ε As +s+1 = ε( ¯ P As ) , ngh(C As ) = s+1 = −ngh( ¯ P As ) . (3.4) In detail, each of the new ghosts consist of two superpartners C A ≡ {C α 0 ; C α 1 } ≡ {B α ; (−1) ε α +1 Π α * } , C As ≡ {B αs ; (−1) ε αs +s+1 Π αs * } , ¯ P A ≡ { ¯ P 0 α ; ¯ P 1 α } ≡ {Π α ; B * α } , ¯ P As ≡ {Π αs ; B * αs } , (3.5) Note that there are two equivalent notations C α 0 ≡ B α , C α 1 ≡ (−1) ε α +1 Π α * , ¯ P 0 α ≡ Π α and ¯ P 1 α ≡ B * α for each of the superpartners. The latter notation stresses a relationship with the antifield formalism, cf. eq. (5.26) below. The canonical commutation relations read {C α 0 , ¯ P 0 β } = {B α , Π β } = δ α β , (3.6) {C α 1 , ¯ P 1 β } = {B * β , Π α * } = δ α β , (3.7)</trash>

In other words, the index A s corresponds to two copies of index α s , s ∈ {0, . . . , L}. Moreover, the index A is a shorthand for all stages A 0 , . . . , A L .

					<trash>3.2 Ghost Operators The old (resp. new) ghost number &quot; gh(A) &quot; (resp. &quot; ngh(A) &quot; ) of an arbitrary operator A may be implemented through a corresponding ghost operator G (resp.

				<p>The anti-supercommutators (1.17) in the above formulas (3.10)-(3.12) ensure the Hermiticity of the ghost operators. Whereas the eqs.

(3.14) In more detail, the Ω operator has the form ‡ Ω = Ω 0 + L s=0 C As V As Bs ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Bs +s + 1 2 r, s ≥ 0 r+s+1 ≤ L C Bs C Ar V ArBs C r+s+1 ¯ P C r+s+1 (−1) ε Bs +ε C r+s+1 +r+1 + 1 2 r, s ≥ 0 r+s+1 ≤ L C C r+s+1 V C r+s+1 BsAr ¯ P Ar ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Ar +r + 1 4 0 ≤ r, s, t, u ≤ L r+s = t+u C Bs C Ar V ArBs CtDu ¯ P Du ¯ P Ct (−1) ε Bs +s+ε Du +u + O(C 3 ¯ P, C ¯ P 3 ) = Ω 0 + B α (−1) ε α +1 Π α * V 0β α0 V 0β α1 V 1β α0 V 1β α1 (−1) ε β Π β (−1) ε β +1 B * β + O(C 2 ¯ P, C ¯ P 2 ) , (3.15</trash>

(3.19) 3.4 Improved Anti-BRST Operator ¯ Ω There is also an improved version ¯ Ω = ¯ Ω 0 + O(C ¯ P) , (3.20) of the anti-BRST operator ¯ Ω 0 such that { ¯ Ω, ¯ Ω} = 0 , ε( ¯ Ω) = 1 , gh( ¯ Ω) = − 1 , ngh( ¯ Ω) = 0 . (3.21)</trash>

					<figDesc>Perhaps surprisingly, one does not demand that the improved BRST and anti-BRST operators commute . Instead the normalized commutator of the two improved charges is assumed to be equal to the new ghost operator G, {Ω, ¯ Ω} = G . (3.22)</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>In this way, the ¯ Ω charge becomes a homotopy operator for the BRST complex of Ω. As a result the cohomology of {Ω, ·} is trivial in sectors of non-zero new ghost number. Proof: If A is a Ω-closed operator, i.e. {Ω, A} = 0, and if A has non-zero new ghost number, it is possible to rewrite A as a Ω-exact operator,</p>

				</figure>

				<p>On the other hand, since ultimately one requires that the physical model in question is Ω-invariant, the homotopy eq. (3.22) implies that one can no longer maintain the anti-BRST symmetry of the model. In this sense, the anti-BRST algebra plays here only a secondary rôle . Similarly, to be consistent, we will not require that the BRST-improved Hamiltonian obeys the anti-BRST symmetry, cf.</p>

				<p>It is useful to think of the new BRST operators Ω and Ω 1 as analogues of the old BRST/anti-BRST operators Ω 0 and ¯ Ω 0 , in particular because of the Sp(2)-like algebra (3.31) although the ghost number assignments are different, cf. Table 1 below. We shall now widen this analogy by introducing a counterpart S 1 of the old S −2 of Subsection 2.5. To this end, note that Ω 1 is Ω-closed (3.26) and has non-zero new ghost number. Hence, it must be Ω-exact, cf. eq.</p>

(3.48) In detail, one may expand S 1 as follows: S 1 = L s=0 C As T As + 1 2 r, s ≥ 0 r+s ≤ L C Bs C Ar U ArBs C r+s ¯ P C r+s (−1) ε Bs +ε C r+s +r + 1 2 r, s ≥ 0 r+s+2 ≤ L C C r+s+2 U C r+s+2 BsAr ¯ P Ar ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Ar +r + O(C 3 ¯ P, C 2 ¯ P 2 , C ¯ P 3 ) = L s=0 (B αs X αs − Π αs * ˜ Y αs ) + O(C 2 ¯ P, C ¯ P 2 ) . (3.49) It starts with the so-called tilde constraints T A 0 = ˜ T A 0 (q, p; C, ¯ P ), and in the reducible case one also introduces higher-stage tilde constraints ˜ T A s+1 ≡ ˜ Z A s+1 Bs ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Bs +s , s = 0, . . . , L−1 . (3.50) The T A constraints carry the same Grassmann parity as the new ghosts C or ¯ P, or equivalently, the opposite Grassmann parity of T A , ε( ˜ T A ) = ε A +1 , ε( ˜ T As ) = ε As +s+1 , ngh( ˜ T As ) = − s . (3.51) The reducible structure functions Z As B s−1 = ˜ Z As B s−1 (q, p; C, ¯ P ) have Grassmann parity and new ghost number given by ε( ˜ Z As B s−1 ) = ε As +ε B s−1 +1 , ngh( ˜ Z As B s−1 ) = 0 . (3.52) The tilde constraints consist of two superpartners ˜ T A ≡ { ˜ T 0 α ; ˜ T 1 α } ≡ { ˜ X α ; (−1) ε α ˜ Y α } , ˜ T As ≡ { ˜ X αs ; (−1) ε αs +s Y αs } .

				<p>The first non-trivial equation (with k = 2) is just eq. (3.60). The maximal arbitrariness of solutions S to the operator master eq. (3.63) with the boundary conditions (3.48) and (3.64) is given by canonical transformations of the form [19]</p>

				<figure>

				<p>It is instructive to mention that the new ghost operator G by itself is a trivial solution for S to the operator master eq. (3.63) and to the first boundary condition (3.64), but it fails to meet the second boundary condition (3.48).</p>

				<p>Proof of properties related to eq. (3.68): It follows from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Theorem that the transformations (3.68) form a group. It is also clear that the transformations (3.68) preserve the operator master eq. (3.63) with the boundary conditions (3.48) and (3.64), so it only remains to prove that all solutions are connected this way. Let there be given two arbitrary solutions S (1) and S (2) .</p>

				<p>For all k ≥ 1, call the difference for X k ≡ S</p>

				<p><formula>(2) k − S (1) k .</formula></p>

				<p>Consider successively, for each k ≥ 1, starting with the smallest k and going up, whether the difference X k is Ω-exact. If this is the case, perform a suitable transformation (3.68) of the second solution S (2) , generated by some Ψ k , such that the new difference X k = 0 becomes identically zero. One now proceeds by indirect reasoning: Assume that this process stops at some step k, i.e. X 1 = X 2 = . . . = X k−1 = 0, but X k is not Ω-exact.</p>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>On the other hand, the two eqs. (3.48) and (3.67) now guarantee that the difference X k is Ω-closed in the two cases k = 1 and k ≥ 2, respectively. Since X k has non-vanishing new ghost number, ngh(X k ) = k = 0, one then concludes from cohomology considerations that X k is Ω-exact, cf. eq. (3.22). This is in contradiction with the above, and hence the process did not stop after all. 3.10 An Inverse Relation to Ω 1 = {Ω, S 1 } For any given solution S, it is possible to create an interesting primed solution S ′ by a canonically transformation (3.68) that has an ¯ Ω-exact Fermionic generator of the form Ψ 1 = { ¯ Ω, S 1 } , (3.74) and where the higher generators Ψ k≥2 remain unspecified.

Recall that S ′ is mediated by an ¯ Ω-exact Fermionic generator of the form Ψ 1 = { ¯ Ω, S 1 } = B α 0 (Y α 0 β 1 − ¯ Z α 0 β 1 ) ¯ P β 1 (−1) ε β 1 − Π α 0 * Y α 0 β 1 ¯ Z β 1 γ 2 ¯ P γ 2 (−1) ε γ 2 . (5.54) The change in S 1 is Ω-exact, S 1 − S ′ 1 = {Ω, Ψ 1 } = Π α 0 * Y α 0 δ 1 − (δ γ 0 α 0 − Y α 0 β 1 Z β 1 γ 0 ) ¯ Z γ 0 δ 1 ¯ P δ 1 (−1) ε δ 1 +1 −B α 0 (Y α 0 β 1 − ¯ Z α 0 β 1 )Z β 1 γ 0 ¯ P γ 0 (−1) ε γ 0 , (5.55) cf. eqs. (3.72) and (5.17). Then the primed solution S ′ 1 reads S ′ 1 = Π α 0 * (δ γ 0 α 0 − Y α 0 β 1 Z β 1 γ 0 ) ¯ Z γ 0 δ 1 ¯ P δ 1 (−1) ε δ 1 +1 −B α 0 δ γ 0 α 0 − (Y α 0 β 1 − ¯ Z α 0 β 1 )Z β 1 γ 0 ¯ P γ 0 (−1) ε γ 0 + L s=1 B αs Z αs β s−1 B * β s−1 . (5.56)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Derived from a canonical transformation (3.72), the primed solution (5.56) is guaranteed to meet the correct boundary condition (3.48). Moreover, the primed solution has the remarkable property that the S ′ 2 operator vanishes identically,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S ′ 2 = 0 , (5.57) if one chooses Ψ 2 = 0. This is because the change in S 2 is given by S ′ 2 − S 2 = {{Ω, Ψ 1 }, S 1 } = B α 1 Z α 1 β 0 Y β 0 γ 1 ¯ P γ 1 (−1) ε γ 1 = − S 2 , (5.58) cf. eqs. (3.73), (5.30) and (5.45).</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Hence it is consistent to choose all the higher operators S ′ k≥2 = 0 equal to zero. To simplify, let us specialize to the case of trivial anti-BRST symmetry ¯ Ω 0 = 0. In this case, the structure functions ¯</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Z α 0 β 1 = 0 vanish, and the S ′ 1 operator (5.56) becomes S ′ 1 = − B α 0 (δ γ 0 α 0 − Y α 0 β 1 Z β 1 γ 0 ) ¯ P γ 0 (−1) ε γ 0 + L s=1 B αs Z αs β s−1 B * β s−1 . (5.59)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Clearly the primed solution (5.59) (or its alter ego (5.56)) is too complicated to serve as a first principle. For instance, the projection inside the B α 0 ¯ P γ 0 term looks rather artificial if postulated from scratch. Also the Hessian of the primed solution (5.59) has a smaller rank than its unprimed counterpart, and hence it represents a solution that is not proper.</p>

				<p>There are practically no conditions on the rotation matrix Λ A 0 B 0 = Λ A 0 B 0 (q, p; C, ¯ P ), and hence the right-hand side of eq. (6.34) does not always vanish. The crucial difference between eq. (6.34) and the above commutator involutions (6.16), (6.17) and (6.18), is, that the operator antibracket (2.13) does not satisfy the pertinent Leibniz rule, while the commutator does. One can easily check with the help of eq. (4.1) that the emerging extra contributions are proportional to the new T A 0 constraints, cf. last term on the right-hand side of eq. (6.28).</p>

				<head n="7">Conclusion</head>

				<p>We have extended the construction of BRST-invariant constraints in Ref. [1] to include reducible gauge algebras. We have also stressed a deep relationship with BRST/anti-BRST symmetric models. Here the two nilpotent, Grassmann-odd, mutually anti-commuting BRST operators come from a deformed version Ω of the ordinary BRST operator Ω 0 , and a new BRST operator Ω 1 = C A T A + . . ., which encodes the new constraints T A . Note however, that all three charges Ω 0 , Ω and Ω 1 have ordinary ghost number +1, and only the latter operator is charges with respect to the new ghost number, ngh(Ω 1 ) = 1, which is different from the usual BRST/anti-BRST formulation. Nevertheless, one finds many similarities at the algebraic level. Some of them is exposed in Table 1.</p>

				<p>In particular, we have constructed a unitarizing Hamiltonian that respects the two BRST operators Ω and Ω 1 with the help of a Gauge Boson.</p>

				<p>The S ≡ ∞ k=0 S k operator, which satisfies an operator master eq. (3.63), plays a prominent rôle in the construction. For instance, the operator S 1 = C A ˜ T A + . . . contains the tilde constraints T A , which decent through eq. (1.15) to the BRST-invariant constraints T A . The existence of the S operator is deduced from cohomological considerations of the pertinent BRST operators. In Appendix D we have considered various candidates to the operator master equation. In particular, we have analyzed the simplest cases, which are likely to become important for practical calculations.</p>

				<p>We have also investigated the algebras of new constraints T A and tilde constraints T A , cf. Section 6. It is found that the corresponding commutator algebras are closed, but only the former follows (with the machinery introduced in the main text excluding Appendix E) from a BRST nilpotency relation. The full antibracket algebra of T A and T A constraints is also closed. So is the antibracket algebra of T A constraints. However, the antibracket algebra of tilde constraints T A is, on the other hand, in general an open algebra.</p>

				<head>A Critical Open Bosonic String Theory</head>

				<p>For completeness, we here list the standard definitions that go into critical open Bosonic string theory. Let η µν = η νµ be a constant invertible target space metric. There are Bosonic matter fields α µ m and Fermionic ghost variables c m and b m , where µ ∈ {1, . . . , D} and m ∈ {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 . . .} is an integer. The canonical commutation relations are [α µ m , α ν n ] = ¯ hκ |m| mδ 0 n+m η µν , [c m , b n ] = ¯ hκ |m| δ 0 n+m , (A.1) and zero in all the remaining sectors. Here κ → 1 is a regularization parameter, which at the end of the calculations should be set to 1. From a world-sheet perspective, the κ-regularization smears the singularity of the operator product expansion (i.e. the OPE relation). The normal ordering &quot; : : &quot; , also known as Wick ordering, is</p>

				<p><formula>: α µ m α ν n : = θ(n−m)α µ m α ν n + θ(m−n)α ν n α µ m , (A.2)</formula></p>

				<p>− : b n c m : = : c m b n : = θ(n−m)c m b n − θ(m−n)b n c m , (A.3) where θ denotes the Heaviside step function with θ(</p>

				<p><formula>0) = 1 2 .</formula></p>

				<p>Here we outline a simple (and we think compelling) proof of the conformal anomaly, which does not rely on zeta function regularization or a choice of vacuum. (In reality, one should make sure that the choice of normal ordering prescription can be accompanied with a compatible choice of bra and ket vacuum states. This of course is the case.) One first rewrites the commutators of Virasoro constraints (1.2) and (1.5) in terms of anti-supercommutators of the elementary modes by straightforward algebraic manipulation, which uses the commutation relations (A.1), [T m</p>

(A.4) and (A.5) become ¯ h(m−n)(T m+n +¯ haδ 0 m+n ) and ¯ h(m−n)T (c) m+n , respectively. On the other hand, for any κ with |κ| &lt; 1, the constant pieces in eqs.

				</figure>

				<p>A few remarks are in order. In the restricted double summations (A.8) and (A.9), which are absolutely and unconditionally convergent for |κ| &lt; 1, note that the (i, j)&apos;th term is antisymmetric under an (i ↔ j) exchange if the summation variables i and j have opposite signs. Therefore one only has to consider i&apos;s and j&apos;s with weakly the same sign. (The word weakly refers to that i or j could be 0.) Since at the same time the sum i+j = m of i and j is held fixed, the restricted (i, j) double sum contains only finitely many terms, which may be readily summed to give the familiar expression for the conformal anomaly, cf. eqs. (A.8) and (A.9). In retrospect, the κ-regularization has picked a particular (although very natural) summation ordering for two infinite sums, which are conditionally convergent.</p>

				<head>B Superfield Formulation</head>

				<p>A peculiar (although absolutely consistent) feature of the new ghosts sector is that the new ghosts can be organized in superpartners that carry shifted ghost numbers. It is tempting to rewrite the superpartner fields as N = 1 superfields by introducing a Fermionic θ-coordinate, and absorb the ghost number deficit into this θ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>gh(θ) = − 1 , ngh(θ) = 0 , ε(θ) = 1 . (B.1)</trash>

					<figDesc>In detail, one may rewrite the construction as follows</figDesc>
					<trash>C A ≡ {C α 0 ; C α 1 } ≡ {B α ; (−1) ε α +1 Π α * } −→ C α (θ) ≡ C α 0 + θC α 1 = B α − Π α * θ , ¯ P A ≡ { ¯ P 0 α ; ¯ P 1 α } ≡ {Π α ; B * α } −→ ¯ P α (θ) ≡ − ¯ P 0 α θ + ¯ P 1 α = −Π α θ + B * α , T A ≡ {T 0 α ; T 1 α } ≡ {T α ; (−1) ε α X α } −→ T α (θ) ≡ −T 0 α θ + T 1 α = −T α θ + X α (−1) ε α . (B.2)</trash>


				</figure>

				<figure>
					<figDesc>As a result, the above superfields carry definite ghost number, gh(C αs (θ)) = s+1 = − gh(T αs (θ)) = − gh( ¯ P αs (θ))−1 . (B.3)</figDesc>

				</figure>

				<p>A similar trick may be applied to the non-minimal variables (4.6) and the gauge-fixing condition (4.19). The superfield transcription (B.2) basically amounts to rewrite all previous capital indices, A; B; C; . . ., in the corresponding superfield indices, α, θ; β, θ ′ ; C, θ ′′ ; . . .. A sum A over a repeated dummy index, which one normally does not write explicitly, now also involve a Berezin integration α dθ, and so forth. In detail, we use the following superconventions,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>dθ θ ≡ 1 , δ(θ) ≡ θ . (B.4) Then the canonical commutation relations (2.3) read {C α (θ), ¯ P β (θ ′ )} = δ α β δ(θ−θ ′ ) = { ¯ P β (θ), C α (θ ′ )} . (B.5) Likewise, one gets dθ C α (θ)T α (θ) = B α T α − Π α * X α = C A T A , (B.6) Ω = Ω 0 + dθ C α (θ)V α β (θ, θ ′ ) ¯ P α (θ ′ )dθ ′ + . . . , (B.7) Ω 1 = dθ C α (θ)T α (θ) + 1 2 dθdθ ′ C β (θ ′ )C α (θ)U αβ γ (θ, θ ′ , θ ′′ ) ¯ P γ (θ ′′ )dθ ′′ + . . . , (B.8) and {T α (θ), T β (θ ′ )} = U αβ γ (θ, θ ′ , θ ′′ ) dθ ′′ T γ (θ ′′ ) . (B.9)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>While aesthetically nice, the super-transcription unfortunately tend to increase the formula size, which is why the superfield formulation is not used in the main part of the paper. We also stress that this superfield formulation only affects the new ghost sector (C A , ¯ P B ), while the old phase variables (q i , p j ; C α , ¯ P β ) remain in a non-supersymmetric formulation.</p>

(C.4) where r, s ∈ {0, . . . , L}. Similarly, some of the consequences of the Ω-closeness (3.26) for Ω 1 read [Z A s+1 Cs , Ω 0 ](−1) ε Cs +s = i¯ hZ A s+1 Bs V Bs Cs + i¯ hV A s+1 B s+1 Z B s+1 Cs , (C.5) (−1) (ε Bs +s+1)(ε Cs +s+1) [Z A s+1 Cs , V Bs Ds ] = (−1) (ε Cs +s)(ε Ds +s) (C s ↔ D s ) , (C.6) (−1) (ε Bs +s+1)(ε Cs +s+1) [V As Cs , Z Bs D s−1 ] = (−1) (ε As +s)(ε Bs +s) (A s ↔ B s ) , s = 0 , (C.7) [Z A s+1 Cs , V Br Dr ] = 0 , r − s = 0 , 1 , (C.8) where r ∈ {0, . . . , L} and s ∈ {0, . . . , L−1}. And finally, some of the consequences of the Ω 1 -nilpotency (3.24) read Z A s+1 Bs Z Bs C s−1 = 0 , s = 0 , (C.9) (−1) (ε B s+1 +s)(ε Cs +s+1) [Z A s+1 Cs , Z B s+1 Ds ] = (−1) (ε Cs +s)(ε Ds +s) (C s ↔ D s ) , (C.10) [Z A r+1 Cr , Z B s+1 Ds ] = 0 , r = s , (C.11) where r, s ∈ {0, . . . , L−1}. All these relations (C.1)-(C.11) can precisely be recast into a nilpotency condition [ ˆ Ω, ˆ Ω] = 0 (C.12) for an operator ˆ Ω = C A ˆ Ω A B ¯ P B (−1) ε B = −Ω 0 L s=0 C As ¯ P As (−1) ε As +s − i¯ h L s=0 C As V As Bs ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Bs +s −i¯ h L−1 s=0 C A s+1 Z A s+1 Bs ¯ P Bs (−1) ε Bs +s , (C.13) cf. Table 3</trash>

				<p>. The second and third term on the right-hand side of eq. (C.13) contain the parts of the Ω and Ω 1 operator that are linear in both C A and ¯ P A . Thê Ω operator (C.13) is Grassmann-odd, has ghost number gh( ˆ Ω) = 1, has indefinite new ghost number (either 0 or 1), and is not necessarily Hermitian. In turn, thê Ω nilpotency (C.12) is equivalent to following conditions for the matrix</p>

					<trash>elements Ω A B = ˆ Ω A B (q, p, C, ¯ P ), ˆ Ω A B ˆ Ω B C = 0 , (C.14) (−1) (ε B +1)(ε C +1) [ ˆ Ω A C , ˆ Ω B D ] = (−1) ε A ε B (A ↔ B) , (−1) ε C ε D (C ↔ D) . (C.15)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In particular, one sees that the operator-valued matrix element Ω A B are nilpotent in a mixed operator/matrix sense, cf. eq. (C.14). The two possible right-hand sides of eq. (C.15) are one and the same condition written twice. A similar story is true for ¯ Ω, and the Ω ↔ ¯ Ω interplay yields an interesting canonical commutation relation in the operator/matrix sense,</p>

				<head>D Operator Master Equations</head>

				<p>In this Appendix we consider candidates to the operator master equations for S and S, cf. eqs. (2.42) and (3.63), respectively. We start with candidates M = 0 to the master eq. for S, and we assume that M takes the form</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M ≡ N n=0 α n Φ n Ω (S, S, . . . , S n entries ) , α N = 0 , (D.1) where Φ n Ω (S, S, . . . , S) are higher antibrackets [17, 20]</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>. In general the n&apos;th (normalized, operator) antibracket of n operators A 1 , A 2 ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>. . ., A n , is defined as Φ n Ω (A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n ) ≡ 1 n! π∈Sn (−1) ε π,A {{. . . {Ω, A π(1) }, . . .}, A π(n) } n normalized commutators , Φ 0 Ω ≡ Ω . (D.2)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The sign-factor ε π,A arises from permuting the operators A 1 , A 2 , . . ., A n under the permutation π ∈ S n , see Ref. [20] for details, and see Refs. [28] and [29] for early field-antifield formulations of higher antibrackets. The Ansatz (D.1) is partly motivated by the fact that the M operator has a well-defined classical limit. This is because the multiple nested normalized commutators (1.18) inside the higher antibracket (D.2) simply reduce to multiple nested Poisson brackets {·, ·} P B when ¯ h → 0. Let us also assume that S 0 is a linear combination of the old and the new ghost operator, S 0 = µG + νG . (D.3)</p>

				<p>We are interested in which S 0 and M that would guarantee a solution for S ≡ ∞ k=0 S k . In other words, which coefficients µ, ν, α 0 , α 1 , α 2 , . . ., would provide the existence of S? Note that M =</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>∞ k=0 M k has quantum numbers ε(M) = ε(M k ) = 1 , ngh(M k ) = k , gh(M) = gh(M k ) = 1 . (D.4)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>Let us for the sake of simplicity restrict attention to the second-order case with N = 2, cf. eq. (D.1). We will show in this case that for each choice of S 0 (more precisely, for each choice of µ and ν = 0), there exists a unique M up to an over-all normalization factor. The proof goes as follows:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>M k = α 2 k j=0 Φ 2 Ω (S j , S k−j ) + α 1 Φ 1 Ω (S k ) + δ 0 k α 0 Φ 0 Ω (D.5) =      α 2 k−1 j=1 Φ 2 Ω (S j , S k−j ) + (α 1 − α 2 (2µ + kν))Φ 1 Ω (S k ) for k ≥ 1 , (α 1 − α 2 (2µ + ν))Ω 1 for k = 1 , (µ 2 α 2 − µα 1 + α 0 )Ω for k = 0 . (D.6) The equations M 0 = 0 and M 1 = 0 yield two conditions, α 0 α 2 = µ(µ + ν) , α 1 α 2 = 2µ + ν , α 2 = 0 . (D.7) The equation M 2 = 0 then becomes −(S 1 , S 1 ) Ω ≡ Φ 2 Ω (S 1 , S 1 ) = νΦ 1 Ω (S 2 ) ≡ ν{Ω, S 2 } . (D.8) One knows that the antibracket (S 1 , S 1 ) Ω = 0 does not always vanish, see for instance eq. (5.44), so one must demand that ν = 0 . (D.9) One next seeks for an integrability condition I = 0, where I ≡ m, n m+n ≤ N β nm Φ n Ω (Φ m M (S, S, . . . , S m entries ), S, S, . . . , S n−1 entries ) , ε(I) = 0 , gh(I) = 2 . (D.10)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The coefficients β nm are to be adjusted such that eq. (D.10) is a non-trivial linear combination of generalized Jacobi identities for the antibracket hierarchy. In the N = 2 case, the relevant generalized Jacobi identities are [20]</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>Φ 1 Ω (Φ 0 Ω ) = 0 , (D.11) Φ 1 Ω (Φ 1 Ω (S)) = 0 , (D.12) Φ 2 Ω (Φ 0 Ω , S) = 0 , (D.13) Φ 1 Ω (Φ 2 Ω (S, S)) + 2Φ 1 Ω (Φ 1 Ω (S), S) = 0 , (D.14) 6Φ 2 Ω (Φ 2 Ω (S, S), S) − Φ 1 Ω (Φ 3 Ω (S, S, S)) = 0 . (D.15) They are all consequences of the Ω nilpotency (3.14). In the N = 2 case, the integrability condition (D.10) reads I ≡ β 10 Φ 1 Ω (Φ 0 M ) + β 11 Φ 1 Ω (Φ 1 M (S)) + β 20 Φ 2 Ω (Φ 0 M , S) = β 10 Φ 1 Ω α 2 Φ 2 Ω (S, S) + α 1 Φ 1 Ω (S) + α 0 Φ 0 Ω +β 11 Φ 1 Ω α 2 Φ 3 Ω (S, S, S) + α 1 Φ 2 Ω (S, S) + α 0 Φ 1 Ω (S) +β 20 Φ 2 Ω α 2 Φ 2 Ω (S, S) + α 1 Φ 1 Ω (S) + α 0 Φ 0 Ω , S) = (β 10 α 2 + β 11 α 1 )Φ 1 Ω (Φ 2 Ω (S, S)) + β 11 α 2 Φ 1 Ω (Φ 3 Ω (S, S, S)) +β 20 α 2 Φ 2 Ω (Φ 2 Ω (S, S), S) + β 20 α 1 Φ 2 Ω (Φ 1 Ω (S), S) . (D.16)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>The β nm coefficients are then tuned so that I = 0 is automatically satisfied. This yield two conditions:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>β 20 β 11 = − 6 , β 10 β 11 = − 4 α 1 α 2 = − 4(2µ + ν) , β 11 = 0 . (D.17) I = ∞ k=0 I k is itself a sum of terms I k with quantum numbers, ε(I k ) = 0 , ngh(I k ) = k , gh(I k ) = 2 . (D.18)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>One can now show the existence of a solution S to the master equation M = 0. Recall that the existence of S 1 and S 2 follows from the Ω-closeness (3.26) and the nilpotency (3.24) of Ω 1 , cf. Subsections 3.7 and 3.8, respectively. One now proceeds by mathematical induction in the integer k ≥ 3. Assume that there exist S 1 , S 2 , . . ., S k−1 , such that M 0 = M 1 = M 2 = . . . = M k−1 = 0. One wants to prove that there exists S k , such that M k = 0. The k&apos;th integrability condition reads</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>I k = β 10 {Ω, M k } + β 11 {Ω, {M k , S 0 }} + β 20 2 {{Ω, M k }, S 0 } + {{Ω, S 0 }, M k } = 2(k−2)νβ 11 {Ω, M k } , (D.19) cf. eq. (D.16). I k = 0</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>implies that M k is Ω-closed, and hence Ω-exact, cf. statement after eq. (3.22). Therefore the Φ 2 -term in eq. (D.6) must be Ω-exact, and hence there exists an S k that makes M k = 0 vanish. The factor (k−2) in eq. (D.19) indicates that non-trivial information must be added to the construction at the second induction step, k = 2, namely the Ω 1 nilpotency (3.24).</p>

				<p>The master eq. (D.1) simplifies further if α 0 = 0, i.e. if µ is either equal to 0 or −ν, cf. eq. (D.7). In the main part of this paper we choose ¶ S 0 = G corresponding to (µ, ν) = (0, 1).</p>

				<p>Now let us drop the use of calligraphic letters and consider candidates M = 0 to the master eq. for S in the old sector, cf. eq. (2.42). The analysis is very similar to the above case, so we shall be brief. Let us assume that S 0 is proportional to the old ghost operator,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>S 0 = µG . (D.20) Note that M = ∞ k=0 M 1−2k has quantum numbers ε(M ) = ε(M 1−2k ) = 1 , gh(M 1−2k ) = 1−2k . (D.21) One finds M 1−2k = α 2 k j=0 Φ 2 Ω 0 (S −2j , S 2(j−k) ) + α 1 Φ 1 Ω 0 (S −2k ) + δ 0 k α 0 Φ 0 Ω 0 (D.22) =      α 2 k−1 j=1 Φ 2 Ω 0 (S −2j , S 2(j−k) ) + (α 1 + 2(k−1)µα 2 )Φ 1 Ω 0 (S −2k ) for k ≥ 1 , α 1 ¯ Ω 0 for k = 1 , (µ 2 α 2 − µα 1 + α 0 )Ω 0 for k = 0 . (D.23) The equations M 1 = 0 and M −1 = 0 yield two conditions, α 0 α 2 = − µ 2 , α 1 α 2 = 0 , α 2 = 0 . (D.24) The equation M −3 = 0 then becomes (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 ≡ − Φ 2 Ω 0 (S −2 , S −2 ) = 2µΦ 1 Ω 0 (S −4 ) ≡ 2µ{Ω 0 , S −4 } . (D.25)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>One knows that the antibracket (S −2 , S −2 ) Ω 0 = 0 does not always vanish, so one must demand that µ = 0 . (D.26)</p>

				<p>As before one adjusts the β nm coefficients so that the integrability condition (D.16) is automatically satisfied. This yield two conditions:</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>β 20 β 11 = − 6 , β 10 β 11 = − 4 α 1 α 2 = 0 , β 11 = 0 . (D.27) I = ∞ k=0 I 2(1−k) is itself a sum of terms I 2(1−k) with quantum numbers, ε(I 2(1−k) ) = 0 , gh(I 2(1−k) ) = 2(1−k) . (D.28) The k&apos;th integrability condition reads I 2(1−k) = β 10 {Ω 0 , M 1−2k } + β 11 {Ω 0 , {M 1−2k , S 0 }} + β 20 2 {{Ω 0 , M 1−2k }, S 0 } + {{Ω 0 , S 0 }, M 1−2k } = 4(2−k)µβ 11 {Ω 0 , M 1−2k } . (D.29)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In the main text we have chosen S 0 = G corresponding to µ = 1. ¶ Note that Ref. [1] has S0 = G−G corresponding to (µ, ν) = (1, −1). The operator master eq. (3.63) remains the same, while there is a change of sign in eq. (3.60); see eqs. (5.22) and (5.19) in Ref. [1]</p>

					<trash>E A New Tilde BRST Operator Ω 1</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>In this Appendix we briefly outline how the involution relations (6.17) and (6.18) could be reformulated as nilpotency requirement for a new tilde BRST operator Ω 1 ,</p>

				<figure>
					<trash>{ ˜ Ω 1 , ˜ Ω 1 } = 0 , ε( ˜ Ω 1 ) = 1 , gh( ˜ Ω 1 ) = 1 , ngh( ˜ Ω 1 ) = 1 . (E.1) The tilde BRST operator Ω 1 is a deformation of Ω 1 , ˜ Ω 1 = Ω 1 + L s=0 C As T As + 1 2 r, s ≥ 0 r+s ≤ L ˜ C Bs C Ar F ArBs C r+s ¯ P C r+s (−1) ε Bs +ε C r+s +r + r, s ≥ 0 r+s ≤ L C Bs C Ar E ArBs C r+s ¯ P C r+s − E ArBs C r+s ¯ P C r+s (−1) ε Bs +ε C r+s +r + . . . . (E.2) Here we have introduced a new set of tilde ghosts C A ≡ { ˜ C α 0 , ˜ C α 1 } and ¯ P A ≡ { ˜ ¯ P 0 α , ˜ ¯ P 1 α } with canonical commutation relations { ˜ C A , ˜ C B } = 0 , { ˜ C A , ˜ ¯ P B } = δ A B = − (−1) ε B { ˜ ¯ P B , ˜ C A } , { ˜ ¯ P A , ˜ ¯ P B } = 0 , (E.3) which have Grassman parity and new ghost number given by ε( ˜ C A ) = ε A = ε( ˜ ¯ P A ) , ε( ˜ C As ) = ε As +s = ε( ˜ ¯ P As ) , ngh( ˜ C As ) = s+1 = −ngh( ˜ ¯ P As ) . (E.4)</trash>

					<figDesc>The Grassmann parity and the old ghost number are shifted among the tilde ghost superpartners as follows ε( ˜</figDesc>
					<trash>C α 0 ) = ε α = ε( ˜ ¯ P 0 α ) , ε( ˜ C αs 0 ) = ε αs +s = ε( ˜ ¯ P 0 αs ) , ε( ˜ C α 1 ) = ε α +1 = ε( ˜ ¯ P 1 α ) , ε( ˜ C αs 1 ) = ε αs +s+1 = ε( ˜ ¯ P 1 αs ) , gh( ˜ C αs 0 ) = s+2 = −gh( ˜ ¯ P 0 αs ) , gh( ˜ C αs 1 ) = s+3 = −gh( ˜ ¯ P 1 αs ) . (E.5)</trash>


				</figure>

				<p>It is now straightforward to check that the weak involution relations (6.16), (6.17) and (6.18) follow from the Ω 1 nilpotency (E.1). An aesthetically drawback of the approach, is, that the tilde constraints T A appear inside two different generating expansions, namely S 1 and Ω 1 .</p>
