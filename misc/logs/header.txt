createTrainingHeader generates (up to) 5 files per document: a raw and tei file for the header, as well as tei files for date, affiliation, and author fields. We have no interest in training the latter three.

Since this is done without the segmentation model as a guide, we may expect the operation to not extract all header data from every document, as it simply takes the first page as a heuristic. This is not necessarily a problem unless this precludes header information (identified by segmentation) that might only appear as a fragment at the back of the document. Assuming this is not the case, the header model will be fed the segmented information en bloc at game time, and will process it as if it were one contiguous section.

The fields for header classification are.
