The segmentation model models the following 

8:<header>, ✓
6:<body>, ✓
12:<references>, ✓
10:<footnote>, ✓
17:<acknowledgement>, ✓
7:<annex>, ✓
10:<headnote>, ✓
7:<cover>, ✓
8:I-<page>, ✓

A publisher's cover page is put in the tags </titlePage>. This probably corresponds with </cover>

In an abuse of notation, training data leaves the </teiHeader> tags essentially empty and in fact places the header in the section </front>. 

</body> tags encapsulate blocks of text belonging to the body, but these are interrupted by </page> tags encapsulating the pages numbers.

<note place="footnote">is for footnotes, (ultimately transformed into <footnote>). It seems to get <headnote> wrong most times, including it in the body, and occasionally mistakes a page number for a footnote. <note place="headnote"> is the correct tagging for such information.

<div type="acknowledgement"></div> identifies an acknowledgement section within the document.

</listBibl> indicates the reference list as a section.

</annex> is apparently for information outside the normal flow of the document. These might be appendices, but "12862_2014_Article_245.training.segmentation.tei.xml" tags blocks which refer to metadata, "Author's Information", "Competing Interests" and such, which have nothing to do with the document content, but in this case fall before the reference list.

Remember: tokens are lines in the segmentation model (as they are in fulltext)

Things get contentious when head- and footnotes appear in positions. It's important to recognise that Grobid is relying on the OCR tool for the correct sequencing of these elements as they appear on the page. This implies that if the OCR tool dependency were to change, we should revise the training set. It is possible, on the other hand, that the OCR tool provides a standard representation, and any alternative would provide Grobid with the same information. In any case, blocks of text e.g. footnotes etc. should not be moved around in the correction process, even if their places appears illogical. Only the tags themselves should be moved where required. This is best illustrated in the case of an article whose body is arranged into two columns of text. Where there are footnotes, these are considered to be part of the column, and so, though it may appear more logical to declare all the footnotes are at the base of the page and should all come after the body sections as a group, the tool will order them thus:

<body>[LEFT COLUMN]</body>
<note place="footnote">[LEFT COLUMN FOOTNOTES]</note>
<body>[RIGHT COLUMN]</body>
<note place="footnote">[RIGHT COLUMN FOOTNOTES]</note>
