	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> According to the conventional knowledge, it is believed<lb/> that the nonlinearity in the arc would not reduce the beam-<lb/>beam performance, since the beam-beam force is dominated<lb/> in the beam core region while the lattice nonlinearity is dom-<lb/>inated in the beam halo region. However in the recent few<lb/> + − storage ring colliders, it has been shown that the lat-<lb/>tice nonlinearity may be important to the luminosity perfor-<lb/>mance. In this paper, we&apos;ll try to review the related story<lb/> in DAFNE, and its upgrade with crab waist scheme, KEKB,<lb/> Super-KEKB and BEPCII.<lb/></div>
