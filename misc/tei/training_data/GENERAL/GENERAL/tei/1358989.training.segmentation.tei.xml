Based on the success of the event, the Board of the Nuclear Physics Division <lb/>decided to launch a series of conferences called Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA) devoted to the interplay <lb/>between nuclear physics and astrophysics. NPA-II,  &quot; a Europhysics Conference &quot; was organized under the auspices of <lb/>the Nuclear Physics Board of the European Physical Society as its 20th Divisional Conference. <lb/>Nuclear physics and astrophysics have been strongly linked ever since it was realised that nuclear reactions were <lb/>a key source of energy in stars. There has been a recent resurgence of activity in the field because of technological <lb/>developments which have raised the possibility of measuring rates for nuclear processes which are very relevant to the <lb/>physics of stars and which were previously inaccessible to laboratory measurement. It is fair to say that the issues <lb/>addressed in nuclear astrophysics are some of the most important and fascinating in the whole of science. Many of <lb/>them were discussed at this Conference. <lb/>The program consisted of review talks on recent developments in nuclear astrophysics and selected oral and poster <lb/>contributions on experimental and theoretical results in the following fields: <lb/> – Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis <lb/> – Neutrino Physics <lb/> – Stellar (non-explosive) Nucleosynthesis <lb/> – Explosive Nucleosynthesis <lb/> – Cross-Section Measurements and Nuclear Data for Astrophysics <lb/> – Nuclear Structure Far from Stability <lb/> – Rare-Ion-Beam Facilities and Experiments <lb/> – Perspectives of Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics <lb/>The Editor-in-Chief and the publishers kindly agreed to publish a Topical Volume in EPJAdirect consisting of <lb/>original and refereed papers from the conference as electronic-only supplement to The European Physical Journal A. <lb/>Independently, this Topical Volume will also be made available in book form for the conference participants and <lb/>the library book market. The electronic version of this Topical Volume in EPJAdirect will be open access to everyone <lb/>worldwide without a time limit. Both oral contributions and posters were peer reviewed by a dedicated committee of <lb/>referees. This rigorous refereeing process assured a high scientific standard for accepted papers. <lb/>Nuclear astrophysics is an outstanding example of state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research. The origin of elements <lb/>studied by geologists is explored by astrophysicists using reactions measured by the nuclear-physics community. Low-<lb/>energy reactions also have an impact on solid-state physics. The Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics II Conference provided <lb/>a good opportunity to discuss the progress in various topics of nuclear astrophysics and stimulated new collaborations <lb/>in the field. <lb/>We would like to thank all of those who attended the conference and the International Advisory and Organizing <lb/>Committees for their time and effort. <lb/> XVI <lb/> The conference would not have been a success without the financial help of the host institute ATOMKI, the <lb/>Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the European Physical Society. <lb/>At its meeting in Albena, Bulgaria on 1st October, 2005, the Nuclear Physics Board of EPS recommended that <lb/>the next Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics Conference (NPA-III) be held in Dresden, Germany in the spring of 2007. <lb/>Zs.

Recent CMB anisotropy data yield a wealth of cosmological parameters; in <lb/>particular, the baryon-to-photon ratio η = n  B  /nγ is measured to high precision. The confrontation between <lb/>the BBN and CMB &quot; baryometers &quot; poses a new and stringent test of the standard cosmology; the status of <lb/>this test is discussed. Moreover, it is now possible to recast the role of BBN by using the CMB to fix the <lb/>baryon density and even some light element abundances. This strategy sharpens BBN into a more powerful <lb/>probe of early universe physics, and of galactic nucleosynthesis processes. The impact of the CMB results <lb/>on particle physics beyond the Standard Model, and on non-standard cosmology, are illustrated. Prospects <lb/>for improvement of these bounds via additional astronomical observations and nuclear experiments are <lb/>discussed, as is the lingering &quot; lithium problem. &quot; <lb/> PACS. 98.80.Ft Origin, formation, and abundances of the elements – 26.35.+c Big Bang nucleosynthesis <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> Big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) offers the deepest <lb/>reliable probe of the early universe, being based on <lb/>well-understood Standard Model physics. Predictions of <lb/>the abundances of the light elements, D, <lb/> 3  He, <lb/> 4  He, and <lb/> 7  Li, synthesized at the end of the &quot; first three minutes &quot; <lb/>are in good overall agreement with the primordial abun-<lb/>dances inferred from observational data, thus validating <lb/>the standard hot big bang cosmology (see [1]). This is <lb/>particularly impressive given that these abundances span <lb/>nine orders of magnitude —from <lb/> 4  He/H ∼ 0.08 down to <lb/> 7  Li/H ∼ 10 <lb/> −10  (ratios by number). Thus BBN provides <lb/>powerful constraints on possible deviations from the <lb/>standard cosmology [2], and on new physics beyond the <lb/>Standard Model [3]. <lb/>We are presently entering an age of a &quot; new cosmol-<lb/>ogy, &quot; in which BBN plays a changing but crucial role. <lb/>The basic world model of a hot big bang has been re-<lb/>soundingly confirmed by a wealth of new observations with <lb/>unprecedented precision. The fundamental parameters of <lb/>this world model, including the abundances of the matter <lb/>and energy component of the cosmos, are now known to <lb/>a few percent. <lb/> a  e-mail: bdfields@uiuc.edu <lb/> The advent of &quot; precision cosmology &quot; is largely spurred <lb/>by measurements of the cosmic microwave background ra-<lb/>diation (CMB). The CMB and BBN are intimately con-<lb/>nected. This link traces back to the work of Gamow, <lb/>Alpher, and Herman [4,5], who determined the thermody-<lb/>namic conditions needed for nucleosynthesis in the early <lb/>universe, and used this to extrapolate a present radiation <lb/>temperature of order T ∼ 5 K. This historic BBN–CMB <lb/>connection has recently been deepened with the advent of <lb/>high-precision measurements of the CMB anisotropy [6]. <lb/>The measurements have led to determinations of cosmo-<lb/>logical parameters with an unprecedented accuracy. These <lb/>include the baryon density, which is the sole parameter in <lb/>standard BBN. <lb/>With the cosmic baryon density measured indepen-<lb/>dently via BBN and the CMB, several new analyses are <lb/>possible. 1) First and foremost, one can pit BBN against <lb/>the CMB, asking whether the results of the independent <lb/>BBN and CMB &quot; baryometers &quot; agree. This comparison <lb/>marks a fundamental and non-trivial test of the hot big <lb/>bang. We will see, in fact, that cosmology passes this test, <lb/>but then other strategies are possible when one combines <lb/> BBN and the CMB, taking advantage of the precision <lb/>of the CMB baryon density determination. 2) For stan-<lb/>dard BBN, a CMB-based baryon density fixes all parame-<lb/>ters. Then BBN simply makes definite predictions for the <lb/></body>

			<body> abundances of the light elements which can then be con-<lb/>trasted with their observational determinations [7]. The <lb/>results shed new light on the nucleosynthesis of light ele-<lb/>ments after the big bang. <lb/>Finally, 3) one can relax the assumptions of stan-<lb/>dard BBN (e.g., an early universe populated only by <lb/>known Standard Model particles and interactions). With <lb/>the baryon density fixed by the CMB, for the first time, <lb/>all light elements are available to probe early universe <lb/>physics. This is perhaps the most exciting new possibil-<lb/>ity for BBN, and highlights the other aspect of the &quot; new <lb/>cosmology, &quot; namely that our view of the constituents, dy-<lb/>namics, and history of the cosmos has drastically changed <lb/>of late. The universe appears to be accelerating today, due <lb/>to a dark energy whose nature is unknown, but may pro-<lb/>vide clues to such far-reaching realms as quantum gravity. <lb/>How and whether the dark energy is connected with an-<lb/>other cosmic period of acceleration —inflation— remains <lb/>to be clearly elucidated. Also, the need for and abundance <lb/>of dark matter is ever more firmly established, but its na-<lb/>ture and any connection with dark energy (or baryons!) is <lb/>unclear. All of these open questions almost surely will find <lb/>their answers in the early universe. And in this context it <lb/>is crucial to appreciate that BBN provides our earliest <lb/>reliable probe. <lb/>Thus the new cosmology presents both challenges and <lb/>opportunities for BBN in general and for nuclear physics <lb/>in particular. These will be the focus of this review, which <lb/>draws heavily from [8] which adopts a very similar ap-<lb/>proach. For other recent reviews see [1]. <lb/> 2 Big bang nucleosynthesis theory <lb/> The theory of BBN consists of following the microphysics <lb/>of weak and nuclear reactions in the cosmological context <lb/>of an expanding, cooling universe. In fact, the essential <lb/>aspects of BBN can be understood in terms of the com-<lb/>petition between the cosmic expansion rate and particle <lb/>reaction rates. The expansion rate H = ˙ <lb/> a/a, with a(t) <lb/> the cosmic scale factor, is given by the usual Friedmann <lb/>equation: <lb/> H <lb/> 2  = <lb/>8πG <lb/>3 <lb/> ρ , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where we have dropped the curvature term and cosmolog-<lb/>ical constant as both are negligible in the early universe <lb/>compared with the energy density. In the early universe, <lb/>the energy density was dominated by relativistic species <lb/>( &quot; radiation &quot; ) <lb/> ρ  rad  = <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> 30 <lb/> 2 + <lb/>7 <lb/>2 <lb/>+ <lb/>7 <lb/>4 <lb/> N  ν <lb/> T <lb/> 4 <lb/> ≡ <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> 30 <lb/> g  *  T <lb/> 4  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>which consists of photons, electrons and positrons, and <lb/> N  ν  neutrino flavors (at higher temperatures, other parti-<lb/>cle degrees of freedom should be included as well). Thus <lb/>time and temperature scale as t ∼ 1/H ∼ 1/T <lb/> 2  , and <lb/>in standard BBN (i.e., with N  ν  = 3), we roughly have <lb/> t/1 s  (2.4/g  *  )(1 MeV/T ) <lb/> 2  . <lb/>The synthesis of the light elements is sensitive to physi-<lb/>cal conditions in the early radiation-dominated era at tem-<lb/>peratures T  1 MeV, corresponding to an age t  1 s. <lb/>At these and higher temperatures, weak interactions rates <lb/> Γ  weak  H were rapid compared to the expansion rate, <lb/>and thus the weak interactions were in thermal equilib-<lb/>rium. In particular, the processes <lb/> n + e <lb/> + <lb/> ↔ p + ¯ <lb/> ν  e  , <lb/>n + ν  e  ↔ p + e <lb/> −  , <lb/>n ↔ p + e <lb/> −  + ¯ <lb/> ν  e  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>fix the ratio of the neutron and proton number den-<lb/>sities to be n/p = e <lb/> −Q/T  , where Q = 1.293 MeV is <lb/>the neutron-proton mass difference. At T  1 MeV, <lb/>(n/p)  1. As the temperature dropped, the neutron-<lb/>proton inter-conversion rate, Γ  np  ∼ G <lb/> 2 <lb/> F  T <lb/> 5  , fell faster than <lb/>the Hubble expansion rate, H ∼ <lb/>√ <lb/> g  *  G  N  T <lb/> 2  . This re-<lb/>sulted in breaking of chemical equilibrium ( &quot; freeze-out &quot; ) <lb/>at T  fr  ∼ (g  *  G  N  /G <lb/> 4 <lb/> F  ) <lb/> 1/6 <lb/>  0.8 MeV. The neutron frac-<lb/>tion at this time, n/p = e <lb/> −Q/T  fr  1/6 is thus sensitive <lb/>to every known physical interaction, since Q is determined <lb/>by both strong and electromagnetic interactions while T  fr <lb/> depends on the weak as well as gravitational interactions. <lb/>Moreover, the sensitivity to the Hubble expansion rate af-<lb/>fords a probe of e.g. the number of relativistic neutrino <lb/>species [9]. After freeze-out the neutrons were free to β-<lb/> decay so the neutron fraction dropped to  1/7 by the <lb/>time nuclear reactions began. A useful semi-analytic de-<lb/>scription of freeze-out has been given in [10,11]. <lb/>The nucleosynthesis chain begins with the formation of <lb/>deuterium in the process p(n, γ)D. However, the number <lb/>density of photons is huge relative to the baryon density, <lb/> i.e., the baryon-to-photon ratio η = n  B  /n  γ  ∼ 10 <lb/> −9  . In-<lb/>deed, η is the sole parameter in the standard BBN model. <lb/> Fig. 1. An abbreviated nuclear network, showing the 12 most <lb/>important reactions whose uncertainties dominate the theoret-<lb/>ical error budget in BBN predictions. <lb/></body>

The full nuclear network used in BBN calculations. <lb/> Because of the large number of photons per baryon, photo-<lb/>dissociation delays production of deuterium (and other <lb/>complex nuclei) well after T drops below the binding en-<lb/>ergy of deuterium, B  D  = 2.23 MeV. The degree to which <lb/>deuterium production is delayed can be found by compar-<lb/>ing the qualitative expressions for the deuterium produc-<lb/>tion and destruction rates, <lb/> Γ  p  ≈ n  B  σv , <lb/> (4) <lb/> Γ  d  ≈ n  γ  σve <lb/> −BD/T  . <lb/> When the quantity η <lb/> −1  exp(−B  D  /T ) ∼ 1, the rate for deu-<lb/>terium destruction (D + γ → p + n) finally falls below the <lb/>deuterium production rate and the nuclear chain begins <lb/>at a temperature T ∼ 0.1 MeV. Only 2-body reactions are <lb/>important because the density has become rather low by <lb/>this time. <lb/>In addition to the p(n, γ)D reaction, there are 10 other <lb/>major strong reactions (along with the neutron lifetime) <lb/>leading to the production of the light elements. These re-<lb/>actions, illustrated in fig. 1, are <lb/>D(D, p)T, <lb/> 3  He(n, p)T, <lb/> D(D, n) <lb/> 3  He, <lb/>D(p, γ) <lb/> 3  He. <lb/>Followed by the reactions producing <lb/> 4  He: <lb/> 3  He(D, p) <lb/> 4  He, <lb/>T(D, n) <lb/> 4  He. <lb/>The gap at A = 5 is overcome and the production and <lb/>destruction of mass A = 7 are regulated by <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 4  He,γ) <lb/> 7  Be → <lb/> 7  Li + e <lb/> +  + ν  e  , <lb/>T( <lb/> 4  He,γ) <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be(n,p) <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Li(p, <lb/> 4  He) <lb/> 4  He. <lb/></front>

			<body>The gap at A = 8 prevents the production of other iso-<lb/>topes in any significant quantity. The nuclear chain in <lb/>BBN calculations was extended [12] and is shown in fig. 2. <lb/>Nearly all the surviving neutrons when nucleosynthesis <lb/>begins, end up bound in the most stable light element <lb/> 4  He. <lb/>Heavier nuclei do not form in any significant quantity both <lb/>because of the absence of stable nuclei with mass number <lb/>5 or 8 (which impedes nucleosynthesis via <lb/> 4  He+n, <lb/> 4  He+p <lb/>or <lb/> 4  He + <lb/> 4  He reactions) and of the large Coulomb barriers <lb/>for reactions such as the T ( <lb/> 4  He, γ) <lb/> 7  Li and <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 4  He, γ) <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>reactions listed above. Hence the primordial mass fraction <lb/>of <lb/> 4  He, conventionally referred to as Y  p  , can be estimated <lb/>by the simple counting argument <lb/> Y  p  = <lb/>2(n/p) <lb/>1 + n/p <lb/> 0.25. <lb/>There is little sensitivity here to the actual nuclear reac-<lb/>tion rates, which are however important in determining <lb/>the other &quot; left-over &quot; abundances: D and <lb/> 3  He at the level <lb/>of a few times 10 <lb/> −5  by number relative to H, and <lb/> 7  Li/H at <lb/>the level of about 10 <lb/> −10  (when η  10  ≡ 10 <lb/> 10  η is in the range <lb/>1–10). These values can be understood in terms of ap-<lb/>proximate analytic arguments [13,11]. The experimental <lb/>parameter most important in determining Y  p  is the neu-<lb/>tron lifetime, τ  n  , which normalizes (the inverse of) Γ  np  . <lb/>(This is not fully determined by G  F  alone since neutrons <lb/>and protons also have strong interactions, the effects of <lb/>which cannot be calculated very precisely.) The experi-<lb/>mental uncertainty in τ  n  used to be a source of concern <lb/>but has recently been reduced substantially. The Particle <lb/>Data Group [14] world average is τ  n  = 885.7 ± 0.8 s. <lb/>Historically, BBN as a theory explaining the observed <lb/>element abundances was nearly abandoned due to its <lb/>inability to explain all element abundances. Subsequently, <lb/>stellar nucleosynthesis became the leading theory for <lb/>element production [15]. However, two key questions <lb/>persisted. 1) The abundance of <lb/> 4  He as a function of <lb/>metallicity is nearly flat and no abundances are observed <lb/>to be below about 23% as exaggerated in fig. 3. In <lb/>particular, even in systems in which an element such <lb/></body>

For <lb/>example, in fig. 4, the N/H vs. O/H correlation is <lb/>shown [16]. As one can clearly see, the abundance of N/H <lb/>goes to 0, as O/H goes to 0, indicating a stellar source for <lb/>nitrogen. 2) Stellar sources cannot produce the observed <lb/>abundance of D/H. Indeed, stars destroy deuterium and <lb/>no astrophysical site is known for the production of <lb/>significant amounts of deuterium [17]. Thus we are led <lb/>back to BBN for the origins of D, <lb/> 3  He, <lb/> 4  He, and <lb/> 7  Li. <lb/>Having sketched the basic physics of BBN, we now <lb/>turn to the detailed predictions and the nuclear data on <lb/>which they rely. <lb/> 3 From nuclear data to primordial abundance <lb/>predictions <lb/> The homogeneous nature of BBN, and the relatively small <lb/>number of key reactions, makes the abundance evolution <lb/>one of the most computationally simple in all of nuclear <lb/>astrophysics. This relative simplicity presents us with the <lb/>opportunity to calculate the abundances with a precision <lb/>and statistical rigor that also is unique to nuclear as-<lb/>trophysics. Given the increasingly precise CMB measure-<lb/>ments, it is fortunate that BBN calculations (and to some <lb/>extent light element observations) can keep pace. <lb/>Because standard BBN theory rests upon the Stan-<lb/>dard Model of particle physics, the electroweak aspects <lb/>of the calculation are very well determined and do not <lb/>introduce an appreciable uncertainty. Instead, the major <lb/>uncertainties come from the thermonuclear reaction rates. <lb/>As noted above, there are 11 key strong rates (as well <lb/>as the neutron lifetime) which dominate the uncertainty <lb/>budget [18,19,20]. In contrast to the situation for much <lb/>of stellar nucleosynthesis, BBN occurs at high enough <lb/>temperatures (strong rates freeze out at T ∼ 0.1 MeV) <lb/>that laboratory data exist at and even below the relevant <lb/>energies, so that no extrapolation is needed; this again <lb/>places BBN in a unique position. <lb/>The goal of BBN theory is to derive primordial abun-<lb/>dances which are as precise as the nuclear data allow, and <lb/>to quantify the uncertainties in the predictions. This pro-<lb/>cess takes several steps, going from the nuclear data to <lb/>the final abundances. 1) First, the relevant nuclear data <lb/>must be cataloged and evaluated. The data deemed reli-<lb/>able are used to infer both the best-fit cross section (in <lb/>fact, the astrophysical S-factor), and to obtain an esti-<lb/>mate of its uncertainty δS, both as functions of energy. <lb/>2) The cross section data are then averaged over a thermal <lb/>Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to obtain thermonuclear <lb/>rates; similarly, one must propagate the cross section un-<lb/>certainties to obtain thermonuclear errors. 3) Finally, the <lb/>thermonuclear rates and uncertainties are placed in the <lb/>BBN code. Monte Carlo techniques [18,19] are used to de-<lb/>termine the best-fit abundances, and their uncertainties, <lb/>at each η. <lb/> Recently the input nuclear data have been carefully <lb/>reassessed [20,21,22], leading to improved precision in the <lb/>abundance predictions. In addition, polynomial fits to the <lb/>predicted abundances and the error correlation matrix <lb/>have been given [23,22]. <lb/>A treatment of the nuclear and statistical aspects of <lb/>the BBN calculation was presented by Cyburt [22]. The <lb/>nuclear data was updated, and the cross sections and their <lb/>uncertainties fit as a function of energy in a systematic <lb/>and statistically consistent manner. The error propaga-<lb/>tion from energy-dependent cross sections to thermal rates <lb/>was structured to explicitly include the effect of system-<lb/>atic errors in the different dataset normalizations, and to <lb/>respond to statistically discrepant datasets. As empha-<lb/>sized in [20], systematic errors of these kinds dominate <lb/>over the statistical errors in the nuclear data. Cyburt ex-<lb/>plicitly presents a set of thermonuclear rates and their <lb/>temperature-dependent uncertainties, tailored for use in <lb/>BBN calculations. He finds that because the systematic <lb/>errors are indeed large, the results are quite similar to <lb/>previous work [18] which have adopted the approxima-<lb/>tion in which these errors dominate.

The left plot shows the abundance <lb/>of <lb/> 4  He by mass, Y , and the abundances of the other three <lb/>isotopes by number. The curves indicate the central pre-<lb/>dictions from BBN, while the bands correspond to the <lb/>uncertainty in the predicted abundances. This theoreti-<lb/>cal uncertainty is shown explicitly in the right panel as <lb/>a function of η  10  . The uncertainty range in <lb/> 4  He reflects <lb/>primarily the 1σ uncertainty in the neutron lifetime. <lb/>We first consider standard BBN, which is based on <lb/>Standard Model physics alone, so N  ν  = 3. (The implica-<lb/>tions of BBN for physics beyond the Standard Model will <lb/>be considered briefly below, sect. 5). As noted above, in <lb/>the standard case, the only free parameter is the density <lb/>of baryons (strictly speaking, nucleons), which sets the <lb/>rates of the strong reactions. The baryon density is usu-<lb/>ally expressed normalized to the blackbody photon den-<lb/>sity as η ≡ n  B  /n  γ  ; while both density change with time <lb/>and temperature, their ratio η remains constant from the <lb/>end of BBN to the present. Because standard BBN is a <lb/>one-parameter theory, any abundance measurement deter-<lb/>mines η, while additional measurements overconstrain the <lb/>theory and thereby provide a consistency check. BBN has <lb/>thus historically been the premier means of determining <lb/>the cosmic baryon density. <lb/>Recently, however, a new &quot; baryometer &quot; has emerged in <lb/>the form of the CMB. The release of the first-year WMAP <lb/>results on the anisotropy spectrum of the CMB were a <lb/>landmark event for all of cosmology, but particularly for <lb/>BBN. As with other cosmological parameter determina-<lb/>tions from CMB data, the derived η  CMB  depends on the <lb/>adopted priors [25], in particular the form assumed for the <lb/>power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. If this <lb/>is taken to be a scale-free power law, the WMAP data <lb/>implies η  10  = 6.58 ± 0.27, while allowing for a &quot; running &quot; <lb/>spectral index lowers the value to <lb/> η  10  = 6.14 ± 0.25. <lb/>(5) <lb/>Equivalently, this can be stated as the allowed range <lb/>for the baryon mass density today, ρ  B  = (4.2 ± 0.2) × <lb/> 10 <lb/> −31  g cm <lb/> −3  , or as the baryonic fraction of the criti-<lb/>cal density: Ω  B  = ρ  B  /ρ  crit  η  10  h <lb/> −2  /274 = (0.0224 ± <lb/> 0.0009)h <lb/> −2  , where h ≡ H  0  /100 km s <lb/> −1  Mpc <lb/> −1  is the <lb/>present Hubble parameter. <lb/>The promise of CMB precision measurements of the <lb/>baryon density suggests a new approach in which the CMB <lb/>baryon density becomes an input to BBN. Thus, within <lb/>the context of the Standard Model (i.e., with N  ν  = 3), <lb/>BBN becomes a zero-parameter theory, and the light el-<lb/>ement predictions are completely determined to within <lb/>the uncertainties in η  CMB  and the BBN theoretical er-<lb/>rors. Comparison with light element observations then can <lb/>be used to restate the test of BBN–CMB consistency, or <lb/></body>

Alternatively, one <lb/>can consider possible physics beyond the Standard Model <lb/>(e.g., with N  ν  = 3) and then use all of the abundances to <lb/>test such models; this is the subject of our final section. <lb/> 4 Light element observations and comparison <lb/>with theory <lb/> BBN theory predicts the universal abundances of D, <lb/> 3  He, <lb/> 4  He, and <lb/> 7  Li, which are essentially determined by t ∼ <lb/> 180 s. Abundances are however observed at much later <lb/>epochs, after stellar nucleosynthesis has commenced. The <lb/>ejected remains of this stellar processing can alter the light <lb/>element abundances from their primordial values, but also <lb/>produce heavy elements such as C, N, O, and Fe ( &quot; met-<lb/>als &quot; ). Thus one seeks astrophysical sites with low metal <lb/>abundances, in order to measure light element abundances <lb/>which are closer to primordial. For all of the light elements, <lb/>systematic errors are an important and often dominant <lb/>limitation to the precision of the primordial abundances. <lb/>In recent years, high-resolution spectra have re-<lb/>vealed the presence of D in high-redshift, low-metallicity <lb/>quasar absorption systems (QAS), via its isotope-shifted <lb/>Lyman-α absorption. These are the first measurements <lb/>of light element abundances at cosmological distances. <lb/>It is believed that there are no astrophysical sources of <lb/>deuterium [27], so any measurement of D/H provides <lb/>a lower limit to primordial D/H and thus an upper <lb/>limit on η; for example, the local interstellar value of <lb/>D/H = (1.5 ± 0.1) × 10 <lb/> −5  [28] requires that η  10  ≤ 9. In <lb/>fact, local interstellar D may have been depleted by a <lb/>factor of 2 or more due to stellar processing. However, <lb/>for the high-redshift systems, conventional models of <lb/>galactic nucleosynthesis (chemical evolution) do not <lb/>predict significant D/H depletion [29]; in this case, <lb/>the high-redshift measurements recover the primordial <lb/>deuterium abundance. <lb/>The five most precise observations of deuterium [30, <lb/>31,32,33] in QAS give D/H = (2.78 ± 0.29) × 10 <lb/> −5  , where <lb/>the error is statistical only. These are shown in fig. 6 <lb/>along with some other recent measurements [34,35,36]. <lb/>Inspection of the data shown in the figure clearly indi-<lb/>cates the need for concern over systematic errors. We thus <lb/>conservatively bracket the observed values with a range <lb/>D/H = 2–5 × 10 <lb/> −5  which corresponds to a range in η  10  of <lb/>4–8 which easily brackets the CMB determined value. In <lb/>principle, the steep decrease of D/H with η makes it a sen-<lb/>sitive probe of the baryon density. We are optimistic that a <lb/>larger sample of D/H in high-redshift, low-redshift, and lo-<lb/>cal systems will bring down systematic errors, and thereby <lb/>increase the precision with which η can be determined. <lb/>Using the WMAP value for the baryon density (5) the <lb/>primordial D/H abundance is predicted to be [7]: <lb/>(D/H)  p  = 2.75 <lb/> +0.24 <lb/> −0.19  × 10 <lb/> −5  . <lb/> (6) <lb/>We note that the predicted value in eq. (6) is slightly <lb/>higher than the value of D/H = 2.62 <lb/> +0.18 <lb/> −0.20  × 10 <lb/> −5  quoted <lb/> Q2206-199 <lb/> Q0347-3819 <lb/>Q1243+3047 <lb/>PKS1937-1009 <lb/> Fig. 6. D/H abundances shown as a function of [Si/H]. Labels <lb/>denote the background QSO, except for the local interstellar <lb/>value (LISM; [28]). <lb/> in [6], this is largely due to our use of the most recent nu-<lb/>clear rates as determined by the most recent nuclear data <lb/>compiled by the NACRE Collaboration [21]; at higher <lb/>values of η, this leads to 5–10% more D/H than older <lb/>rates [26]. As one can see from fig. 7 (top left), this is in <lb/>excellent agreement with the average of the 5 best deter-<lb/>mined quasar absorption system abundances noted above. <lb/>We observe <lb/> 4  He in clouds of ionized hydrogen (HII re-<lb/>gions), the most metal-poor of which are in dwarf galax-<lb/>ies. There is now a large body of data on <lb/> 4  He and CNO <lb/>in these systems [37]. These data confirm that the small <lb/>stellar contribution to helium is positively correlated with <lb/>metal production. <lb/> 4  He abundance determinations depend <lb/>on the overall intensity of the He emission line, but also <lb/>on a number of physical parameters associated with the <lb/>HII region. These include, the temperature, the electron <lb/>density, optical depth and degree of underlying absorp-<lb/>tion. Previous extrapolations to zero metallicity have been <lb/>based on various assumptions concerning these parame-<lb/>ters and typically gave relatively low values for the pri-<lb/>mordial <lb/> 4  He abundance. For example, a study using <lb/> 4  He <lb/>abundance where the electron density is derived from SII <lb/>observations yielded [16,38] Y  p  = 0.238 ± 0.002 ± 0.005. <lb/>Here the latter error is an estimate of the systematic un-<lb/>certainty; this dominates, and is based on the scatter in <lb/></body>

Other extrapolations to zero metallicity give <lb/> Y  p  = 0.2443 ± 0.0015 [37], and Y  p  = 0.2391 ± 0.0020 [40]. <lb/>These are based on a self-consistent approach to deter-<lb/>mining the <lb/> 4  He abundance. That is, several He lines are <lb/>used to best fit the physical parameters. The effects of <lb/>underlying absorption was not included in these analyses. <lb/>Recently a careful study of the systematic uncertain-<lb/>ties in <lb/> 4  He, particularly the role of underlying absorption, <lb/>has led to a higher value for the primordial abundance of <lb/> 4  He [41]. Using a subset of the highest quality from the <lb/>data of Izotov and Thuan [37], all of the physical param-<lb/>eters listed above including the <lb/> 4  He abundance were de-<lb/>termined self-consistently with Monte Carlo methods [39]. <lb/>Note that the <lb/> 4  He abundances are systematically higher, <lb/>and the uncertainties are several times larger than quoted <lb/>in [37]. In fact this study has shown that the value deter-<lb/>mined for Y  p  is highly sensitive to the method of analysis <lb/>used. The extrapolated <lb/> 4  He abundance was determined to <lb/>be Y  p  = 0.249±0.009. Conservatively, it would be difficult <lb/>at this time to exclude any value of Y  p  inside the range <lb/>0.232–0.258. <lb/> Fig. 8. Contributions to the total predicted lithium abun-<lb/>dance from the adopted GCE model of [48], compared with <lb/>low-metallicity stars and a sample of high-metallicity stars. <lb/>The solid curve is the sum of all components. <lb/> At the WMAP value for η, the <lb/> 4  He abundance is pre-<lb/>dicted to be [7] <lb/> Y  p  = 0.2484 <lb/> +0.0004 <lb/> −0.0005  . <lb/> (7) <lb/>While this value is considerably higher than any prior de-<lb/>termination of the primordial <lb/> 4  He abundance as can bee <lb/>seen in fig. 7 (bottom left), it is in excellent agreement <lb/>with the most recent analysis of the <lb/> 4  He abundance [41]. <lb/>Note also that the large uncertainty ascribed to this value <lb/>indicates that while <lb/> 4  He is certainly consistent with the <lb/>WMAP determination of the baryon density, it does not <lb/>provide for a highly discriminatory test of the theory at <lb/>this time. <lb/>We also note that the CMB itself is sensitive to the <lb/>helium abundance, which affects the mean number of <lb/>electrons per baryon in the cosmic plasma. This opens <lb/>the possibility that one can use the CMB to measure not <lb/>only η but also <lb/> 4  He, and thus test BBN entirely with the <lb/>CMB, without reference to low-redshift measurements <lb/>and prior to any stellar nucleosynthetic contamination <lb/>[42,43]. The issues of Y  p  degeneracy with other cosmo-<lb/>logical parameters remain to be sorted out, but we are <lb/>optimistic that this approach may become an important <lb/>new tool for BBN. <lb/>The systems best suited for Li observations are metal-<lb/>poor stars in the spheroid (Pop II) of our Galaxy. Ob-<lb/>servations have long shown [44] that Li does not vary <lb/>significantly in Pop II stars with metallicities  1/30 of <lb/>solar —the &quot; Spite plateau &quot; . Recent precision data sug-<lb/>gest a small but significant correlation between Li and <lb/>Fe [45] which can be understood as the result of Li pro-<lb/>duction from Galactic cosmic rays [46]. Extrapolating to <lb/>zero metallicity one arrives at a primordial value [47] <lb/>Li/H|  p  = (1.23 ± 0.06) × 10 <lb/> −10  . <lb/>Figure 8 shows the different Li components for a model <lb/>with ( <lb/> 7  Li/H)  p  = 1.23 × 10 <lb/> −10  .

This value is in clear contradiction with <lb/>most estimates of the primordial Li abundance as can be <lb/>seen from fig. 7 (bottom right). <lb/>The quoted value for the <lb/> 7  Li abundance assumes that <lb/>the Li abundance in the stellar sample reflects the initial <lb/>abundance at the birth of the star; however, an impor-<lb/>tant source of systematic uncertainty comes from the pos-<lb/>sible depletion of Li over the  10 Gyr age of the Pop <lb/>II stars. The atmospheric Li abundance will suffer deple-<lb/>tion if the outer layers of the stars have been transported <lb/>deep enough into the interior, and/or mixed with material <lb/>from the hot interior; this may occur due to convection, <lb/>rotational mixing, or diffusion. Standard stellar evolution <lb/>models predict Li depletion factors which are very small <lb/>(σ  A(Li)  &lt; 0.05 dex) in very metal-poor turnoff stars [49]. <lb/>However, there is no reason to believe that such simple <lb/>models incorporate all effects which lead to depletion such <lb/>as rotationally induced mixing and/or diffusion. Current <lb/>estimates for possible depletion factors are in the range <lb/> ∼ 0.2–0.4 dex [50]. As noted above, this data sample [45] <lb/>shows a negligible intrinsic spread in Li leading to the con-<lb/>clusion that depletion in these stars is as low as 0.1 dex. <lb/>Another important source for potential systematic un-<lb/>certainty stems from the fact that the Li abundance is <lb/>not directly observed but rather, inferred from an ab-<lb/>sorption line strength and a model stellar atmosphere. <lb/>Its determination depends on a set of physical param-<lb/>eters and a model-dependent analysis of a stellar spec-<lb/>trum. Among these parameters, are the metallicity char-<lb/>acterized by the iron abundance (though this is a small <lb/>effect), the surface gravity which for hot stars can lead <lb/>to an underestimate of up to 0.09 dex if log g is overes-<lb/>timated by 0.5, though this effect is negligible in cooler <lb/>stars. Typical uncertainties in log g are ±0.1–0.3. The <lb/>most important source for error is the surface tempera-<lb/>ture. Effective-temperature calibrations for stellar atmo-<lb/>spheres can differ by up to 150–200 K, with higher tem-<lb/>peratures resulting in estimated Li abundances which are <lb/>higher by ∼ 0.08 dex per 100 K. Thus accounting for a <lb/>difference of 0.5 dex between BBN and the observations, <lb/>would require a serious offset of the stellar parameters. <lb/>We note however, that a recent study [51] with tempera-<lb/>tures based on Hα lines (considered to give systematically <lb/>high temperatures) yields <lb/> 7  Li/H = (2.19 <lb/> +0.46 <lb/> −0.38  ) × 10 <lb/> −10  . <lb/>These results are based on a globular cluster sample and <lb/>do show considerable dispersion. This result is consistent <lb/>with previous Li measurements of the same cluster which <lb/>gave <lb/> 7  Li/H = (1.91 ± 0.44) × 10 <lb/> −10  [52] and <lb/> 7  Li/H = <lb/>(1.69 ± 0.27) × 10 <lb/> −10  [53]. A related study (also of globu-<lb/>lar cluster stars) gives <lb/> 7  Li/H = 2.29 × 10 <lb/> −10  [54]. <lb/>Finally another potential source for systematic un-<lb/>certainty lies in the BBN calculation of the <lb/> 7  Li abun-<lb/>dance. As one can see from fig. 5, the predictions for <lb/> 7  Li <lb/>carry the largest uncertainty of the 4 light elements which <lb/>stems from uncertainties in the nuclear rates. The effect <lb/>of changing the yields of certain BBN reactions was re-<lb/>cently considered by Coc et al. [55]. In particular, they <lb/>concentrated on the set of cross sections which affect <lb/> 7  Li <lb/>and are poorly determined both experimentally and the-<lb/>oretically. In many cases however, the required change <lb/>in cross section far exceeded any reasonable uncertainty. <lb/>Nevertheless, it may be possible that certain cross sec-<lb/>tions have been poorly determined. In [55], it was found <lb/>for example, that an increase of either the <lb/> 7  Li(d, n)2 <lb/> 4  He <lb/>or <lb/> 7  Be(d, p)2 <lb/> 4  He reactions by a factor of 100 would reduce <lb/>the <lb/> 7  Li abundance by a factor of about 3. <lb/>The possibility of systematic errors in the <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>reaction, which is the only important <lb/> 7  Li production chan-<lb/>nel in BBN, was considered in detail in [56]. The ab-<lb/>solute value of the cross section for this key reaction is <lb/>known relatively poorly both experimentally and theoret-<lb/>ically. However, the agreement between the standard solar <lb/>model and solar neutrino data thus provides additional <lb/>constraints on variations in this cross section. Using the <lb/>standard solar model of Bahcall [57], and recent solar neu-<lb/>trino data [58], one can exclude systematic variations of <lb/>the magnitude needed to resolve the BBN <lb/> 7  Li problem at <lb/>the  95% CL [56]. Thus the &quot; nuclear fix &quot; to the <lb/> 7  Li BBN <lb/>problem is unlikely. <lb/>Finally, we turn to <lb/> 3  He. Here, the only observations <lb/>available are in the solar system and (high-metallicity) <lb/>HII regions in our Galaxy [59]. This makes inference of the <lb/>primordial abundance difficult, a problem compounded by <lb/>the fact that stellar nucleosynthesis models for <lb/> 3  He are <lb/>in conflict with observations [60]. Consequently, it is no <lb/>longer appropriate to use <lb/> 3  He as a cosmological probe [61]; <lb/>instead, one might hope to turn the problem around and <lb/>constrain stellar astrophysics using the predicted primor-<lb/>dial <lb/> 3  He abundance [62]. For completeness, we note that <lb/>the <lb/> 3  He abundance is predicted to be [7]: <lb/> 3  He/H = 9.28 <lb/> +0.55 <lb/> −0.54  × 10 <lb/> −6 <lb/> (9) <lb/>at the WMAP value of η. <lb/> The overall concordance as evidenced in fig. 7 is en-<lb/>couraging and will be sharpened with further WMAP <lb/>data, and subsequently from Planck Surveyor measure-<lb/>ments. However, note that <lb/> 7  Li is inconsistent with the <lb/>CMB (as it is with D and <lb/> 4  He) given the error budgets we <lb/>have quoted. The question then becomes more pressing as <lb/>to whether this mismatch comes from systematic errors <lb/>in the observed abundance predictions, or whether there <lb/>might be new physics at work. <lb/> 5 Beyond the Standard Model <lb/> Given the simple physics underlying BBN, it is remark-<lb/>able that it still provides the most effective test for the <lb/></body>

			<body> cosmological viability of ideas concerning physics beyond <lb/>the Standard Model. Limits on particle physics beyond <lb/>the Standard Model come mainly from the observational <lb/>bounds on the <lb/> 4  He abundance. As discussed earlier, the <lb/>neutron-to-proton ratio is fixed by its equilibrium value <lb/>at the freeze-out of the weak interaction rates at a tem-<lb/>perature T  f  ∼ 1 MeV modulo the occasional free neu-<lb/>tron decay. Furthermore, freeze-out is determined by the <lb/>competition between the weak interaction rates and the <lb/>expansion rate of the universe <lb/> G  F <lb/> 2  T  f <lb/> 5 <lb/> ∼ Γ  weak  (T  f  ) = H(T  f  ) ∼ <lb/> G  N  g  *  T  f <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (10) <lb/>In the Standard Model, the number of relativistic particle <lb/>species at 1 MeV is g  *  = 5.5+ <lb/> 7 <lb/>4  N  ν  , where 5.5 accounts for <lb/>photons and e <lb/> ±  , and N  ν  is the number of (massless) neu-<lb/>trino flavors. The presence of additional neutrino flavors <lb/>(or any other relativistic species) at the time of nucleosyn-<lb/>thesis increases the overall energy density of the universe <lb/>and hence the expansion rate leading to a larger value <lb/>of T  f  , (n/p), and ultimately Y  p  . Because of the form of <lb/>eq. (10) it is clear that just as one can place limits [9] <lb/>on N  ν  , any changes in the weak or gravitational coupling <lb/>constants can be similarly constrained (for a discussion <lb/>see ref. [63]). <lb/>The helium curves in fig. 5 were computed taking <lb/> N  ν  = 3; the computed abundance scales as ΔY  BBN  <lb/> 0.013ΔN  ν  [10]. Clearly the central value for N  ν  from BBN <lb/>will depend on η, which is independently determined (with <lb/>little sensitivity to N  ν  ). Here we have taken the WMAP <lb/>value for η. As one can see from fig. 7 (bottom left), if <lb/>the best value for the observed primordial <lb/> 4  He abundance <lb/>is 0.249, then, for η  10  ∼ 6, the central value for N  ν  is <lb/>very close to 3. The dependence of the light element abun-<lb/>dances on N  ν  is shown in fig. 9 [26]. Because of the rel-<lb/>atively large error on the newly determined value for Y  p  , <lb/>the 2 σ upper limit to Y  p  of 0.267 implies a conservative <lb/>bound of <lb/> N  ν  4.5. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Note that this bound is significantly weaker than previ-<lb/>ous bounds using smaller values for the primordial <lb/> 4  He <lb/>abundance. <lb/>It is also possible to use D to place an interesting limit <lb/>on N  ν  [7]. As seen in fig. 9, D is not as sensitive to N  ν <lb/> as <lb/> 4  He is, but nonetheless it does have a significant de-<lb/>pendence. The relative error in the observed abundance <lb/>of D/H ranges from 7–10%, depending on what systems <lb/>are chosen for averaging. If the five most reliable systems <lb/>are chosen, the peak of the N  ν  likelihood distribution lies <lb/>at N  ν  ≈ 3.0, with a width of ΔN  ν  ≈ 1.0 as seen in fig. 10. <lb/>However, if we limit our sample to the two D systems that <lb/>have had multiple absorption features observed, then the <lb/>peak shifts to N  ν  ≈ 2.2, with a width of ΔN  ν  ≈ 0.7 as <lb/>shown by the dashed curve. Adopting the five-system D <lb/>average, D/H = (2.78 ± 0.29) × 10 <lb/> −5  , we get the following <lb/>constraints on N  ν  : <lb/>ˆ <lb/> N  ν  = 3.02 , <lb/> (12) <lb/>1.26 &lt; N  ν  &lt; 5.22 (95% CCL) . <lb/> Fig. 9. BBN abundance predictions [26] as a function of the <lb/>baryon-to-photon ratio η, for Nν = 2 to 7. The bands show <lb/>the 1σ error bars. Note that for the isotopes other than Li, the <lb/>error bands are comparable in width to the thickness of the <lb/>abundance curve shown. All bands are centered on N  ν  = 3. <lb/> Fig. 10. Likelihoods for Nν as predicted by the WMAP η <lb/> (eq. (5)) and light element observations as in fig. 7. <lb/> While the limit from D/H remains weaker than the revised <lb/> 4  He limit, it is certainly beginning to be competitive. <lb/>The limits on N  ν  can be translated into limits on other <lb/>types of particles or particle masses that would affect <lb/>the expansion rate of the universe during nucleosynthesis. <lb/>For example consider &quot; sterile &quot; neutrinos with only right-<lb/>handed interactions of strength G  R  &lt; G  F  . Such particles <lb/>would decouple at higher temperature than (left-handed) <lb/></body>

Thus (relativistic) particles with less than full <lb/>strength weak interactions contribute less to the energy <lb/>density than particles that remain in equilibrium up to <lb/>the time of nucleosynthesis [64]. If we impose N  ν  &lt; 4.5 <lb/>as an illustrative constraint, then the three right-handed <lb/>neutrinos must have a temperature 3(T  νR  /T  νL  ) <lb/> 4  &lt; 1.5. <lb/>The temperature of the decoupled ν  R  &apos;s is determined by <lb/>entropy conservation, where s = (4/3)ρ/T in a radiation-<lb/>dominated Universe.

At the onset of BBN, g  *  = 10.75; to achieve g  *  &gt; <lb/> 18 requires the inclusion of quarks and gluons in the back-<lb/>ground, and thus one is forced to a temperature greater <lb/>than the quark/hadron transition temperature or T  d  &gt; <lb/> 140 MeV. The decoupling temperature is related to G  R <lb/> through (G  R  /G  F  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∼ (T  d  /3 MeV) <lb/> −3  , where 3 MeV is the <lb/>decoupling temperature for ν  L  s. This yields a limit G  R  <lb/> 10 <lb/> −2  G  F  . This limit becomes sensitive to the assumed up-<lb/>per limit to N  ν  when T  d  is constrained to be larger than <lb/>the temperature of the quark-hadron transition. <lb/> 6 Summary <lb/> As cosmology moves into a new and high-precision era, the <lb/>utility of BBN is shifting from a test of the basic cosmolog-<lb/>ical world model to one which is a sensitive probe of astro-<lb/>physical processes which relate to the light element abun-<lb/>dances as well as a sensitive probe of physics beyond the <lb/>Standard Model. The parameters of the Standard Model <lb/>as they relate to BBN are now well determined: η  10  = 6.14 <lb/>and N  ν  = 3. With these values, BBN is able to make <lb/>very definite predictions for the primordial abundances of <lb/>the light elements. These predictions are then contrasted <lb/>with observational determinations of the abundances and <lb/>reveal either our knowledge or ignorance of the astrophys-<lb/>ical process which affect the primordial abundances. In <lb/>the case of <lb/> 4  He and D/H, within the large uncertainties in <lb/>the observational data, the concordance is excellent. <lb/> 7  Li <lb/>remains problematic though several possible (if not per-<lb/>fect) astrophysical solutions are available. Finally, as the <lb/>data on the light element abundances improves, BBN will <lb/>sharpen its ability to probe physics beyond the Standard <lb/>Model. As such it remains the only available tool for which <lb/>to examine directly the very early universe. <lb/>The power and reach of BBN in the &quot; new cosmology &quot; <lb/>rests upon the precision of its nuclear inputs, and of light <lb/>element observations. Nuclear physicists can justly take <lb/>pride that the cross sections used in BBN are now well <lb/>measured, in the key cases to better than 10%. However, as <lb/>cosmology develops ever higher requirements for precision, <lb/>BBN must also improve. Thus there is a need to improve <lb/>all nuclear reaction data. More specifically, some reactions <lb/>stand out as particularly in need of further examination. <lb/>Notable examples are n(p, γ)d, which are well measured <lb/>but not in the crucial BBN regime near ∼ 100 keV, and <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be which dominates production of <lb/> 7  Li and thus <lb/>lies at the heart of the &quot; lithium problem. &quot; Active work <lb/>on these reactions was reported in NPA-II, and we look <lb/>forward to seeing these efforts bear fruit by the NPA-III <lb/>meeting. <lb/> I am grateful to the organizers for a stimulating and enjoyable <lb/>meeting, and for being especially gracious hosts. It is a pleasure <lb/>to thank my longtime BBN collaborators, particularly Keith <lb/>Olive and Richard Cyburt. The work of B.D.F. was supported <lb/>by the National Science Foundation under grant AST-0092939. <lb/></body>

Peeters <lb/> a <lb/> For the SNO Collaboration <lb/>University of Oxford, Particle Physics, Denys Wilkinson Building, Keble Road, Oxford, OX1 3RH, UK <lb/>Received: 1 July 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 10 February 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is a 1 ktonne heavy-wateř <lb/>Cerenkov detector. The first <lb/>phase of this experiment has shown that neutrinos from the Sun change flavour. For the second phase <lb/>of the experiment, approximately 2 tonnes of salt (NaCl) was added to the heavy water to enhance the <lb/>neutral-current detection as well as the neutral-current and charged-current separability. Here the results <lb/>are presented from the complete salt phase at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The electron energy <lb/>spectrum is presented for the first time. It is consistent with an undistorted <lb/> 8  B spectral shape. It is <lb/>also consistent with the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) parameters obtained through a global fit including <lb/>the data presented in this paper. These parameters are found to be Δm <lb/> 2  = (8.0 <lb/> +0.6 <lb/> −0.4  ) × 10 <lb/> −5  eV <lb/> 2  and <lb/> θ = 33.9 <lb/> +2.4 <lb/> −2.2  degrees. The total flux of active-flavour neutrinos from <lb/> 8  B decay in the Sun is found to be <lb/>4.94 <lb/> +0.21 <lb/> −0.21  (stat) <lb/> +0.38 <lb/> −0.34  (syst), whereas the integral flux of electron neutrinos for an undistorted <lb/> 8  B spectrum is <lb/>1.68 <lb/> +0.0.6 <lb/> −0.06  (stat) <lb/> +0.08 <lb/> −0.09  (syst), both in units of 10 <lb/> 6  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . The day-night asymmetry in the observed fluxes <lb/>is consistent with both absence of matter-enhancement effects in the Earth and with the small level of <lb/>these effects expected for the LMA model as stated above. <lb/> PACS. 26.65.+t Solar neutrinos – 14.60.Pq Neutrino mass and mixing <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Ray Davis&apos; experiment [1] indicated over 35 years ago that <lb/>the observed electron neutrino flux from the Sun was lower <lb/>than expected from the Standard Solar Model [2]. As it <lb/>was thought that the physics of Sun was well understood, <lb/>this discrepancy was deemed &quot; the solar neutrino prob-<lb/>lem &quot; . <lb/>In the first &quot; D  2  O &quot; phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Ob-<lb/>servatory (SNO), the long-standing solar neutrino prob-<lb/>lem was solved. It demonstrated (see [3]) that the total <lb/>active neutrino flux from the Sun, observed via neutral-<lb/>current (NC) reactions, is consistent with Standard Solar <lb/>Model (SSM), whereas the electron neutrino component of <lb/>this flux, observed via charged-current (CC) reactions, is <lb/>indeed too low. This shows that neutrinos change flavour <lb/>on their way from the Sun to the Earth and thus solved <lb/>the solar neutrino problem. <lb/>In the second &quot; salt &quot; phase of SNO, 2 tonnes of ultra-<lb/>pure salt (NaCl) was dissolved into the heavy water. This <lb/>enhanced the detection efficiency of the NC flux, but more <lb/>importantly this increased the separability of the CC re-<lb/>actions and the NC reactions. The results of the first 254 <lb/> a  e-mail: s.peeters1@physics.ox.ac.uk <lb/> days of data of this phase were published in [4]. Recently, <lb/>the results of the full 391 days of data of this phase were <lb/>published [5] and these results will be discussed in this <lb/>article. <lb/>Finally, the third ( &quot; NCD &quot; ) phase of SNO has started <lb/>recently. In this phase 40 <lb/> 3  He proportional counters <lb/>(neutral-current detectors or &quot; NCDs &quot; ) have been placed <lb/>inside the heavy-water volume. These absorb and de-<lb/>tect the neutrons (produced by NC reactions) within the <lb/>heavy-water volume and will allow an even better separa-<lb/>tion of NC events and CC events. <lb/> 2 The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory <lb/> SNO [6] is a 1 ktonne wateř <lb/>Cerenkov detector, located <lb/>at a depth of 2092 m (6010 m of water equivalent) in <lb/>the INCO Ltd. Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario in <lb/>Canada. The detector (see fig. 1) consists of a 5.5 cm thick, <lb/>12 m diameter acrylic vessel (AV), holding the 1000 tonnes <lb/>ultra-pure D  2  O target, surrounded by 7 ktonnes of ultra-<lb/>pure H  2  O shielding. The AV is surrounded by a 17.8 m di-<lb/>ameter geodesic sphere, holding 9456 inward-looking and <lb/>91 outward-looking 20 cm photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). <lb/></body>

The PSUP holds the photomultiplier tubes. <lb/> The PMTs are surrounded by light concentrators, which <lb/>increase the light collection efficiency. The effective cov-<lb/>erage is 59%. The volume outside the geodesic support <lb/>structure acts both as a cosmic-ray veto system and as <lb/>a shield from naturally occurring radioactivity from the <lb/>surrounding rock and the construction materials. <lb/>SNO detects neutrinos via elastic scattering (ES, ν  x  + <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> → ν  x  +e <lb/> −  , x = e, μ, τ ), CC (ν  e  +d → p+p+e <lb/> −  ) and NC <lb/>(ν  x  + d → n + p + ν  x  ). The elastic scattering is sensitive <lb/>to all neutrino flavours, but the electron neutrino reaction <lb/>is enhanced by a factor of approximately 6.5 compared to <lb/>the other flavours. The CC reaction is only sensitive to <lb/>electron neutrinos. The NC reaction, however, is equally <lb/>sensitive to all active neutrino flavours. <lb/>The ES and CC events are observed by thě <lb/>Cerenkov <lb/>light generated by the electron produced in these reac-<lb/>tions. The NC events are observed more indirectly.

The dis-<lb/>tributions shown here are normalised to the neutron detection <lb/>efficiency in the two phases for R &lt; 550 cm. <lb/> to the NC reaction is enhanced. This increase of detection <lb/>efficiency comes about from two effects. <lb/>Firstly, the neutron capture cross-section of deuterium <lb/>is 0.5 mbarn, whereas the neutron capture cross-section <lb/>of <lb/> 35  Cl is 44 barn. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the <lb/>neutron capture efficiency for the D  2  O phase and the salt <lb/>phase, as measured using calibration sources in SNO.

The <lb/>event isotropy is determined by the spatial distribution of <lb/>triggered PMTs in an event and is parameterised as <lb/> β  14  = β  1  + 4β  4 <lb/> (2) <lb/>with <lb/> β  l  = <lb/>2 <lb/> N (N − 1) <lb/> N −1 <lb/> i=1 <lb/>N <lb/> j=i+1 <lb/> P  l  (cos θ  ij  ), <lb/>(3) <lb/>where P  l  is the Legendre polynomial of order l, N is the <lb/>total number of trigger PMTs in the event, and cos θ  ij  is <lb/>the angle between PMTs i and j relative to the recon-<lb/>structed event vertex. <lb/>There is a small background of external neutrons (EN) <lb/>created by radiation outside the D  2  O volume that can be <lb/>separated using these observables. Background neutrons <lb/>produced inside the D  2  O volume (for example, produced <lb/>by photodisintegration of deuterium by γ&apos;s from the low <lb/>levels of natural radioactivity) are determined by separate <lb/>analyses and extracted after the fit. <lb/>Detailed Monte Carlo simulations are used to gener-<lb/>ate probability density functions (PDFs) characterizing <lb/>signal distributions and are shown in figs. 4 and 5. These <lb/>PDFs are used in a extended maximum-likelihood fit to <lb/>the 4722-event dataset to extract the electron neutrino <lb/>energy spectrum, <lb/> 8  B neutrino fluxes, and day-night asym-<lb/>metries. As some neutrino oscillation scenarios can distort <lb/>the electron neutrino spectrum, the energy distribution of <lb/>the CC and ES interaction was not assumed. For these two <lb/>signals PDFs were created separately for each 0.5 MeV in-<lb/>terval in the range 5.5–13.5 MeV. For T  eff  &gt; 13.5 MeV a <lb/>single bin was used due to the low statistics in this energy <lb/>region. A single PDF was used, for both the NC and EN <lb/>components whose T  eff  spectra are determined by the en-<lb/>ergy release of neutron capture on <lb/> 35  Cl are independent of <lb/>neutrino energy. The normalisation for each of these PDFs <lb/>was allowed to vary in the fit giving a model-independent <lb/>measurement of the neutrino energy spectrum. <lb/>To take the correlations between the four vari-<lb/>ables, multi-dimensional PDFs were used. Ideally a <lb/>4-dimensional PDF should be used, which would take into <lb/>account all correlations automatically. Unfortunately, sta-<lb/>tistical limitations made this unpractical. The two follow-<lb/>ing factorisations were considered: <lb/> P (T  eff  , β  14  , ρ, cos θ   ) = <lb/>(4) <lb/> P (T  eff  , β  14  ) × P (cos θ   ) × P (ρ) <lb/>and <lb/> P (T  eff  , β  14  , ρ, cos θ   ) = <lb/>(5) <lb/> P (T  eff  , β  14  , ρ) × P (cos θ   |T  eff  , ρ). <lb/> Both factorisations were tested by applying the signal ex-<lb/>traction procedure to 100 Monte Carlo datasets. It was <lb/>found that the parameterisation in eq. (4) resulted in a <lb/>small bias. Equation (5) showed no sign of bias. This re-<lb/>duction in bias can be understood by the inclusion of cor-<lb/>relations with ρ and cos θ   in eq. (5). When the expected <lb/>bias was corrected for, both approaches gave consistent <lb/>results when applied to the data. <lb/> 3.2 Systematic uncertainties <lb/> Systematic uncertainties in detector response are evalu-<lb/>ated through comparisons of Monte Carlo simulations and <lb/>calibration data.

The <lb/> 252  Cf <lb/>source is used to evaluate neutron response characteris-<lb/>tics. Systematic uncertainties are propagated by perturb-<lb/>ing the PDFs according to the estimated 1σ variation in <lb/>each response parameter, and then repeating the signal <lb/>extraction process. The dominant systematic uncertain-<lb/>ties on the CC and NC extracted fluxes in the energy-<lb/>unconstrained analysis are due to uncertainties in the β  14 <lb/> parameters. Uncertainties of less than a percent in the <lb/>mean isotropy values translate to uncertainties of around <lb/>4% in the CC and NC fluxes. The energy scale uncer-<lb/>tainty in the salt phase is estimated to be 1.15%, which <lb/>contributes a 3.5% uncertainty in the NC flux, but has a <lb/>smaller effect on the CC and ES fluxes. A radial scaling un-<lb/>certainty of 1% is also one of the larger contributions to the <lb/>overall systematic error, contributing roughly a 3% uncer-<lb/>tainty to each flux. The ES flux uncertainty is dominated <lb/>by a 5% systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty in <lb/>angular resolution. These are the major contributions to <lb/>the systematic errors for the unconstrained analysis. <lb/> 4 Results <lb/> 4.1 Solar neutrino flux results <lb/> The energy unconstrained analysis as described in sect. 3.1 <lb/>classified 2010 ± 85 events as NC, 2176 ± 78 as CC, and <lb/>279±26 events as ES.

Measurements of the NC rate in the <lb/>third phase of the SNO experiment will further improve <lb/>determinations of the fundamental neutrino oscillation pa-<lb/>rameters. <lb/> 5 Conclusions <lb/> New results from the salt phase of the SNO experiment <lb/>have been summarised, including a measurement of the <lb/>flux of <lb/> 8  B solar electron neutrinos through the CC reac-<lb/>tion and a measurement of the <lb/> 8  B solar neutrinos of all <lb/>flavours through the neutral-current reaction. The use of <lb/>the isotropy parameter as a tool to statistically separate <lb/>the CC and NC events allows a model-independent mea-<lb/>surement of the solar neutrino fluxes in the salt phase. The <lb/>flux results confirm and improve previous results, demon-<lb/>strating solar neutrino flavour change and contributing to <lb/>evidence for solar neutrino oscillations. <lb/>Global analysis of solar neutrino and KamLAND data <lb/>strongly favour LMA oscillations. The oscillation param-<lb/>eter space has now been tightly constrained to a region <lb/>where the predicted distortion to the <lb/> 8  B energy spectrum <lb/>is small. The measured energy spectrum derived from the <lb/>CC reaction is consistent with the expected spectrum as-<lb/>suming an undistorted <lb/> 8  B shape, as well as with the pre-<lb/>dicted spectrum consistent with the best-fit LMA param-<lb/>eters. The day-night flux asymmetries predicted for the <lb/>LMA scenario are also small and the day-night asymme-<lb/>tries measured here are consistent with these predictions, <lb/>as well as with no day-night effect. <lb/> 6 Outlook <lb/> Improved precision in the NC flux measurement is ex-<lb/>pected from the third phase of SNO. The salt was removed <lb/>from the detector in October 2003, in preparation of the <lb/>installation of the neutral-current detectors (NCDs). Forty <lb/>string of <lb/> 3  He proportional counters with a total length <lb/>of approximately 350 m have been installed into the D  2  O <lb/>volume. This will provide an independent measurement <lb/>of the NC flux on an event-by-event basis.

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> All physical phenomena observed up to now in experi-<lb/>ments performed with or without accelerators proved re-<lb/>peated confirmations of the validity of the Standard Model <lb/>(SM). They enabled, moreover, the measurement of the <lb/>set of fundamental constants which appear in their the-<lb/>oretical formalism. Many problems are still open, stim-<lb/>ulating extensions of such a model: the high number <lb/>of free parameters appearing in the SM (the three cou-<lb/>pling constants, the masses of the fermions, the Cabibbo-<lb/>Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix), the &quot; running &quot; coupling con-<lb/>stants, the missing explanation of the hierarchy of the <lb/>masses of the fermions. Recently, furthermore, with the <lb/>discovery of neutrino oscillation the number of parame-<lb/>ters increases with the need of introducing the analogue <lb/>of the CKM matrix for the flavour mixing of neutrinos. <lb/>Following the pattern of what was done for the weak <lb/>and electromagnetic interaction, physicists are looking for <lb/>a &quot; Unified Theory &quot; of strong and electroweak interac-<lb/>tions, named Grand Unified Theory (GUT). Such a theory <lb/>should include the SM, in the same way as the weak theory <lb/>includes electromagnetism and the theory of weak inter-<lb/>actions. The fundamental idea is based on the assumption <lb/> a  e-mail: Stefano.Pirro@mib.infn.it; Present address: <lb/> INFN -Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, S.S. 17 bis <lb/>km 18+910, Assergi (AQ), Italy. <lb/> of the existence of an energy scale M  GUT  (∼ 10 <lb/> 15  GeV) at <lb/>which the three coupling constants, i.e. weak, electromag-<lb/>netic and strong, converge toward a single coupling con-<lb/>stant, which corresponds to a single interaction; such an <lb/>interaction is based on a single gauge group. Many GUTs <lb/>have been proposed, differing mainly in the choice of the <lb/>gauge group on which they base themselves. The common <lb/>characteristics of almost all GUTs are the violation of the <lb/>lepton and baryon number. In order to have lepton num-<lb/>ber violation, the neutrino must be a Majorana particle. <lb/>As pointed out very recently by the Members of the <lb/>APS Multidivisional Neutrino Study [1], Double Beta De-<lb/>cay (DBD) searches will play the central role in neutrino <lb/>physics of the next decade. <lb/> 2 Dirac neutrinos and Majorana neutrinos <lb/> Charged particles are, obviously, not their own antiparti-<lb/>cles, due to the fact that they have an electric charge. In <lb/>the same way, neutral particles, such as the neutron or the <lb/>K <lb/> 0  , differ from their antiparticles since they have a baryon <lb/>number. Neutrinos, however, could be equal to their own <lb/>antiparticles: in this case the neutrino would be a Majo-<lb/>rana particle. In the framework of the Standard Model, <lb/>massive Dirac neutrinos consist of four different states: <lb/>suppose the existence of a neutrino with negative helicity <lb/>(left handed) ν  L  ; if CPT theorem holds, then there will <lb/></body>

Now, <lb/>if the neutrino has a mass then there will exist a Lorentz <lb/>boost that permits the helicity flip. Thus if the neutrino <lb/>has a charge (lepton number) and a mass, it consists of <lb/>four different states and is called a Dirac neutrino. If, on <lb/>the contrary, the neutrino does not have a charge, only <lb/>the two helicity states are defined; this is called a Majo-<lb/>rana neutrino (see fig. 1). Due to the V − A structure of <lb/>the Standard Model the right-handed neutrinos are sterile, <lb/>thus only two neutrinos are able to interact, as in the Ma-<lb/>jorana case. The difference is that in the Standard Model <lb/>they interact due to their charge while in the Majorana <lb/>case they interact due to their helicity. <lb/>From a theoretical point of view, the possibility that <lb/>neutrinos are Majorana particles is particularly appealing. <lb/>The fact that neutrinos and charged leptons, belonging <lb/>to the same weak isodoublet, have an extremely different <lb/>mass (at least a factor 10 <lb/> 5  ) cannot be explained in the <lb/>Dirac theory. Such an &quot; anomaly &quot; can be explained, with-<lb/>out the insertion of an &quot; ad hoc &quot;  symmetry, through the <lb/> &quot; see-saw &quot; mechanism [2]: in the Majorana case, the mass <lb/>of the neutrino naturally satisfies the relation M  ν  M ≈ <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> q,  , where M  q,  represents the mass of a lepton or a <lb/>quark, and M represents a mass scale. <lb/>Due to their tiny mass, the Dirac neutrinos in na-<lb/>ture are produced, practically, always left handed, while <lb/>anti-neutrinos are right handed. It is therefore impossi-<lb/>ble to discriminate whether they interact due to the lep-<lb/>ton charge or due to their helicity. Different characteris-<lb/>tics arise from the CPT transformation rules: it can be <lb/>demonstrated [3] that if CPT is a conserved symmetry, <lb/>then the Majorana neutrino cannot have an electric dipole <lb/>or magnetic dipole moment. The magnetic moment for a <lb/>Dirac neutrino can be evaluated [4] as 3.2 · 10 <lb/> −19  m  ν  μ  B <lb/> (μ  B  is the Bohr magneton and m  ν  is expressed in eV). <lb/>The present experimental limits are at least six orders of <lb/>magnitude far away from the predicted value. There are <lb/>other possibilities in order to search for lepton number <lb/>non-conservation as in the case of pions and mesons de-<lb/>cays [5]; the expected sensitivity, however, is very small <lb/>compared to DBD. Thus the most favourable way to dis-<lb/>criminate between Dirac and Majorana neutrino turns out <lb/>to be the neutrinoless double beta decay (0νDBD). <lb/>After the discovery of neutrino oscillation, implying <lb/>neutrino masses, the introduction of a mixing matrix be-<lb/>tween flavour eigenstates and mass eigenstates is straight-<lb/>forward. This matrix, analogous of the CKM matrix of the <lb/>quark sector, is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata <lb/>(PMNS) matrix [6]. The flavour eigenstates can then be <lb/>written as ν  α  = <lb/> i  U  αi  ν  i  . U  αi  are the elements of the <lb/>PMNS matrix, and are related to the observable mixing <lb/>angles in the base where the charged lepton masses are di-<lb/>agonal. For Majorana neutrinos there is an additional ma-<lb/>trix that takes into account the fact that in this case there <lb/>are 2 more complex phases. Using the Chau and Keung [7] <lb/>parameterization of the PMNS matrix, we have: <lb/> ⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/> ν  e <lb/> ν  μ <lb/> ν  τ <lb/> ⎞ <lb/>⎠ = UV <lb/> ⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/> ν  1 <lb/> ν  2 <lb/> ν  3 <lb/> ⎞ <lb/>⎠ = <lb/> ⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/> c  12  c  13 <lb/> s  12  c  13 <lb/> s  13  e <lb/> −iδ <lb/> −s  12  c  23  −c  12  s  23  s  13  e <lb/> iδ  c  12  c  23  −s  12  s  23  s  13  e <lb/> iδ  s  23  c  13 <lb/> s  12  s  23  −c  12  c  23  s  13  e <lb/> iδ <lb/> −c  12  s  23  −s  12  c  23  s  13  e <lb/> iδ  c  23  c  13 <lb/> ⎞ <lb/>⎠ <lb/> × <lb/> ⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 e <lb/> iφ2/2 <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 0 e <lb/> i(φ3/2+δ) <lb/> ⎞ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/> ν  1 <lb/> ν  2 <lb/> ν  3 <lb/> ⎞ <lb/>⎠ , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where c  ij  ≡ cos θ  ij  and s  ij  ≡ sin θ  ij  ; θ  ij  are the mixing <lb/>angles measured with the neutrino oscillations; δ is the <lb/>Dirac CP phase. V is a diagonal matrix containing the <lb/>Majorana CP phases (φ  2  end φ  3  ) that do not exist in the <lb/>case of Dirac neutrinos and that, in any case, cancel in <lb/>neutrino oscillations. <lb/> 3 Double beta decay <lb/> The two-neutrino double beta decay mode (2νDBD) is <lb/>expected to occur in the Standard Model as a second-<lb/>order effect of the well-known beta decay Hamiltonian, <lb/>and it imposes no special requirements on the properties <lb/>of the neutrino. It will occur irrespective of whether the <lb/>neutrino is a Majorana or a Dirac particle and irrespective <lb/>of whether it has a mass or not. The possible 2ν decay <lb/>modes are <lb/>(A, Z) → (A, Z + 2) + 2e + 2¯ ν  e <lb/> ββ <lb/> − <lb/> (A, Z) → (A, Z − 2) + 2e <lb/> +  + 2ν  e <lb/> ββ <lb/> + <lb/> (A, Z) + 2e <lb/> − <lb/> → (A, Z − 2) + 2ν  e <lb/> ECEC <lb/> (A, Z) + e <lb/> − <lb/> → (A, Z − 2) + e <lb/> +  + 2ν  e <lb/> ECβ <lb/> + <lb/> (2) <lb/>Nuclear transitions accompanied by positron emission or <lb/>electron capture processes are, however, characterized by <lb/>poorer experimental sensitivities and will not be discussed <lb/>in the following. The first process of eq. (2) represents the <lb/>analogue of the single beta decay mediated by the weak <lb/>current in which a d quark transforms into an u with the <lb/>emission of an e <lb/> −  and an ¯ <lb/> ν; even if mediated by the same <lb/>weak interaction, DBD is a second-order transition, result-<lb/>ing in an extremely slow decay rate, namely the slowest <lb/>process ever observed in nature. Using simple dimensional <lb/>arguments it is straightforward to demonstrate that, as a <lb/>first approximation, the 2νDBD is ∼ 10 <lb/> 21  times slower <lb/></body>

The experimental <lb/>observation of 2νDBD is therefore possible only if the sin-<lb/>gle beta decay is prohibited by energy conservation or, at <lb/>least, strongly hindered by small transition energy and/or <lb/>by large change of angular momentum. This happens, for-<lb/>tunately, with several nuclei in nature and is due to the <lb/> &quot; pairing &quot; interaction [8] (see fig. 2). The first &quot; direct &quot; ob-<lb/>servation of the 2νDBD was obtained in 1987 [9] and is <lb/>now observed in more than ten nuclei [10,11]. <lb/>More interesting is the neutrinoless double beta decay <lb/>(0νDBD), first proposed by Furry [12] in 1939. In this case <lb/>there is the maximum lepton number violation (ΔL = 2) <lb/>and the decay is, therefore, not allowed by the Standard <lb/>Model. The 0νDBD can occur only if two requirements <lb/>are satisfied: <lb/> – the neutrino has to be a Majorana particle, <lb/> – the neutrino has to have a mass and/or the neutral <lb/>current has to have a right-handed (V +A) component. <lb/>The second condition is needed because of the helicity <lb/>of the neutrino. Due to the V − A nature of the weak <lb/>interaction, the neutrino emitted in the first vertex (see <lb/>fig. 3) is right handed, while in order to be absorbed in the <lb/>second one, it needs to change its helicity.

The <lb/>presence of the φ  k  phases implies that cancellations are, <lb/>unfortunately, possible. Such cancellations are complete <lb/>for a Dirac neutrino, since it is equivalent to two degen-<lb/>erate Majorana neutrinos with opposite CP phases. This <lb/>stresses once more the fact that 0νDBD can occur only <lb/>through the exchange of Majorana neutrinos. <lb/>From a Particle Physics point of view, 0νDBD repre-<lb/>sents a unique tool in order to measure the neutrino Ma-<lb/>jorana phases and to assess the absolute scale of the neu-<lb/>trino masses.

The evaluation methods for the <lb/>two decay modes show, however, relevant differences (e.g. <lb/>the neutrino propagator), and the effectiveness of such a <lb/>comparison is still controversial [13,20,21]. A popular but <lb/>doubtful attitude consists in considering the spread of the <lb/>different evaluations as an estimate of their uncertainties. <lb/>In such a way one obtains a spread of about one order <lb/>of magnitude in the expected half-lives (table 1), corre-<lb/>sponding to a factor of ∼ 3 in m  ν  . It is clear that a <lb/>big improvement in the calculation of NME or, at least, <lb/>in the estimate of their uncertainties would be welcomed. <lb/>New calculation methods should be pursued while insist-<lb/>ing on the comparison with dedicated measurements com-<lb/>ing from various areas of nuclear physics [22]. On the other <lb/>hand, an experimental effort to investigate as many ββ <lb/> emitters as possible should be addressed. <lb/> 4 Prediction on the Majorana mass <lb/> The input parameters in order to figure out the possible <lb/>mass pattern of the Majorana neutrinos are given by the <lb/>neutrino oscillations. The most updated values [23,24,25, <lb/>26,27,28] are given in table 2. <lb/>Given the two Δm <lb/> 2  measured with the oscillations, <lb/>and given the assumption of three neutrinos, the absolute <lb/>mass scale is still missing. Nevertheless, three scenarios are <lb/>possible, as shown in fig. 4. The previously quoted values <lb/>can be accommodated in the framework of three neutrinos <lb/>mixing, which describes the three flavour neutrinos (ν  e  , <lb/> ν  μ  and ν  τ  ) as unitary linear combinations of the three <lb/>massive neutrinos (ν  1  , ν  2  and ν  3  ) having masses m  1  , m  2  , <lb/>and m  3  , respectively. The experimental measurements are <lb/>compatible with three mass schemes: <lb/>1. Normal hierarchy: m  1  &lt; m  2  &lt; m  3  , i.e. Δm <lb/> 2 <lb/>23  &gt; 0, <lb/> Δm <lb/> 2 <lb/>12  Δm <lb/> 2 <lb/>sun  m <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  , Δm <lb/> 2 <lb/>23  |Δm <lb/> 2 <lb/>atm  | | m <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  .

Such remotely probable signals have <lb/>to be disentangled from a background due to natural ra-<lb/>dioactive decay chains, cosmogenic-induced activity, and <lb/>man-made radioactivity, which deposit energy in the same <lb/>region as the DBD, but at a faster rate. Consequently, the <lb/> main task in 0νDBD searches is to diminish the back-<lb/>ground by using the state-of-the-art ultra-low background <lb/>techniques and, hopefully, identifying the signal. Many are <lb/>the experiments searching for DBD. They may be substan-<lb/>tially subdivided into three categories: <lb/> – Geochemical determination of the total decay time <lb/>through the measurement of the daughter nuclei <lb/>(A, Z + 2) produced by the parent nuclei (A, Z) in a <lb/>sample of &quot; old &quot; geological rocks. <lb/> – Radiochemical measurement of the total decay time by <lb/>the extraction of the radioactive daughter nuclei from <lb/>the parent nuclei. <lb/> – Direct detection of the two electrons emitted in the <lb/>transition. <lb/>The experiments belonging to the first two classes do <lb/>not allow to distinguish among the two decay channels. <lb/>They are, however, extremely sensitive to inclusive effects, <lb/>since the so called &quot; accumulation times &quot; for the daughter <lb/>isotope are very long. They gave, however, the first in-<lb/>direct prove [41] of the existence of the 2νDBD, but are <lb/>no longer pursued nowadays. Direct experiments are the <lb/>most interesting ones because they allow to distinguish <lb/>the various modes of the double beta decay. It is therefore <lb/>possible to search for the decay without neutrinos, which <lb/>represents the most interesting process. The nuclear de-<lb/>tector capable of revealing the two electrons emitted by <lb/>the DBD-Emitter should have some basic properties: <lb/> – High energy resolution, since a peak must be identified <lb/>over a background. <lb/> – Low background, which requires the use of extremely <lb/>radiopure materials: natural radioactivity (mainly <lb/> 232  Th and <lb/> 238  U chains) exhibits decay times of the or-<lb/>der of 10 <lb/> 9  years, extremely short if compared with the <lb/>expected 0νDBD that should have a decay time larger <lb/>than 10 <lb/> 25  years. Furthermore it is absolutely necessary <lb/>to operate the detector in underground laboratories in <lb/>order to shield cosmic rays. <lb/> – Large source of DBD nuclei in order to have sensitivity <lb/>to the decay time up to 10 <lb/> 25  –10 <lb/> 28  years. <lb/> – Event reconstruction methods, since the 0νDBD has a <lb/>very characteristic decay with the two electrons that <lb/>share the Q  ββ  energy. Electron tracking can therefore <lb/>help in rejecting background. <lb/></body>

			<body> Unfortunately there are up to now no detectors that can <lb/>fulfill these four requirements at the same time. Two are, <lb/>substantially, the experimental approaches: <lb/> – homogenous detectors (or active source detectors), <lb/>whose mean feature is to have the active ββ source <lb/>inside the detector material, <lb/> – non-homogeneous detectors (or passive source detec-<lb/>tors), in which the source and the detector are distinct. <lb/>Various conventional counters have been used so far in <lb/>DBD direct searches: solid state devices (germanium spec-<lb/>trometers and silicon detector stacks), gas counters (time <lb/>projection chambers, ionization and multiwire drift cham-<lb/>bers) and scintillators (crystal scintillators and stacks of <lb/>plastic scintillators). Techniques based on the use of low <lb/>temperature true calorimeters have been, on the other <lb/>hand, proposed and developed in order to improve the <lb/>experimental sensitivity and enlarge the choice of suitable <lb/>candidates for DBD searches investigable with an active <lb/>source approach. <lb/>A common feature of all DBD experiments has been <lb/>the constant work against backgrounds caused mainly by <lb/>environmental radioactivity, cosmic radiation and residual <lb/>radioactive contaminations of the detector setup elements. <lb/>The further suppression of such backgrounds will be the <lb/> actual challenge for future projects whose main goal will <lb/>be to maximize the 0νDBD rate while minimizing back-<lb/>ground contributions. <lb/>In order to compare different experiments and in or-<lb/>der to point out the advantages and the disadvantages <lb/>of the two different detecting techniques, it is convenient <lb/>to introduce a very important parameter, called &quot; sensi-<lb/>tivity &quot; , denoted by F . It is defined as the process half-<lb/>life corresponding to the maximum number of signals (n) <lb/>that could be hidden by the background fluctuations, at a <lb/>given statistical CL. Let t be the measurement time, N  ββ <lb/> be the number of atom candidates for ββ decay present <lb/>in the source, B (expressed in number of counts per unit <lb/>energy per unit time) the background counting rate in <lb/>the energy region where the decay peak is expected and <lb/> ΔE the FWHM energy resolution. The expected number <lb/>of background counts in an energy interval equal to the <lb/>FWHM energy resolution centered at the transition en-<lb/>ergy can then be written as N  B  = BΔEt. The sensitivity <lb/>factor F at 1σ level (n = <lb/> √ <lb/> N  B  ) is defined as <lb/> F ≡ T  1/2  = <lb/>ln 2 N  ββ  t <lb/>n <lb/> = ln 2 N  ββ <lb/> t <lb/>BΔE <lb/>. <lb/> (9) <lb/>If the background (measured as counts per unit energy per <lb/>unit mass per unit time) is proportional to the detector <lb/>mass the above formula can be rewritten as <lb/> F = ln 2 <lb/> i.a..x <lb/>A <lb/>N  A <lb/> Mt <lb/>BΔE <lb/> (68% CL), <lb/>(10) <lb/>where A is the compound molecular mass, x the number <lb/>of ββ atoms per molecule, i.a. their isotopic abundance, <lb/> M the source mass, N  A  the Avogadro&apos;s number and <lb/> the efficiency of the detector. In addition to its simplicity, <lb/>eq. (10) has the advantage of emphasizing the role of the <lb/>essential experimental parameters: mass, measuring time, <lb/>isotopic abundance, background level, energy resolution <lb/>and detection efficiency. <lb/>As far as the active source experiments are concerned, <lb/>they can have detection efficiencies of the order of ∼ 90%, <lb/>and energy resolution of the order of ∼ 0.2% FWHM <lb/>(for Ge diodes and bolometers), while the background <lb/>(mainly arising from the surrounding setup) cannot be <lb/>easily rejected. As far as the passive source experiments <lb/>are concerned, they are mostly performed with gas detec-<lb/>tors (TPC, DC) in which the source is introduced into <lb/>the volume of the detector as very thin sheets (of about <lb/>50 μm), to reduce the energy loss of the electrons emit-<lb/>ted in the decay. The detection efficiency associated with <lb/>this kind of measure is of the order of 30%. The great ad-<lb/>vantage of these experiments lies in the reduction of the <lb/>background: the clear trace, which is peculiar in a drift <lb/>chamber, for a 2 electrons event, guarantees a very good <lb/>capability of background discrimination. The energy reso-<lb/>lution, on the other hand, cannot be as good as ∼ 7–10% <lb/>FWHM. As will be shown in sect. 7 the energy resolution <lb/>plays an extremely crucial role in the second-generation <lb/>experiments due to the fact that the 2νDBD close to the <lb/>endpoint will result in an unavoidable/unrejectable source <lb/>of background for the 0νDBD mode. <lb/> 6 First-generation experiments <lb/> Impressive progress has been obtained during the last <lb/>years in improving 0νDBD half-life limits for several iso-<lb/>topes and in systematically cataloguing 2νDBD rates (ta-<lb/>ble 3). Although 2νDBD results are in some cases incon-<lb/>sistent, the effort to cover as many ββ nuclei as possible <lb/>thus allowing a direct check for 2νDBD NME is evident. <lb/>Optimal 0νDBD sensitivities have been reached in a se-<lb/>ries of experiments based on the active source approach. <lb/>In particular, the best limit on 0νDBD comes from the <lb/>Heidelberg-Moscow (HM) experiment [31] on <lb/> 76  Ge even <lb/>if similar results have been obtained also by the IGEX <lb/>experiment [34] (table 3). <lb/>In both cases a large mass (several kg) of isotopically <lb/>enriched (86%) germanium diodes, is installed deep un-<lb/>derground under heavy shields for gamma and neutron <lb/>environmental radiation. Extremely low background lev-<lb/>els are then achieved thanks to a careful selection of the <lb/>setup materials and further improved by the use of pulse <lb/>shape discrimination (PSD) techniques. Both experiments <lb/>quote similar background levels in the 0νDBD region of <lb/> ≈ 0.2 (c/keV · kg · y) and ≈ 0.06 (c/keV · kg · y) before <lb/>and after PSD. Taking into account the uncertainties in <lb/>the NME calculations, such experiments indicate a limit <lb/>of 0.3–1 eV for m  ν  . <lb/> As will be discussed later, new ideas to improve such a <lb/>successful technique characterize many of the proposed <lb/>future projects. However, given the NME calculation <lb/>problem, more ββ emitters than allowed by the use of <lb/></body>

			<body> conventional detectors (e.g. <lb/> 76  Ge, <lb/> 136  Xe, <lb/> 116  Cd) should <lb/>be investigated using the calorimetric approach. A solu-<lb/>tion to this problem, suggested [42] and developed [43] by <lb/>the Milano group, is based on the use of low temperature <lb/>calorimeters (bolometers). Besides providing very good en-<lb/>ergy resolutions they can in fact practically eliminate any <lb/>constraint in the choice of the ββ emitter. Due to their <lb/>very simple concept (a massive absorber in thermal con-<lb/>tact with a suitable thermometer measuring the temper-<lb/>ature increase following an energy deposition), they are <lb/>in fact constrained only by the requirement of finding a <lb/>compound allowing the growth of a diamagnetic and di-<lb/>electric crystal. Extremely massive [44] detectors can then <lb/>be built, by assembling large crystal arrays. <lb/>Thermal detectors have been pioneered by the Milano <lb/>group for <lb/> 130  Te (chosen, because of its favourable nuclear <lb/>factor-of-merit and large natural isotopic abundance, from <lb/>a large number of other successfully tested ββ emitters) <lb/>in a series of constantly increasing mass experiments car-<lb/>ried out at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), <lb/>whose last extension, started in 2003, is the CUORICINO <lb/>experiment [38]. Consisting of an array of 62 TeO  2  crystals <lb/>totalling a mass of 40.7 kg and operating at a temperature <lb/>of ∼ 8–9 mK, CUORICINO is characterized by a good en-<lb/>ergy resolution (7–8 keV on the average at the 0νDBD <lb/>transition energy, 2528 keV) and a background level of <lb/> ∼ 0.18 (c/keV · kg · y). The quoted limit of 1.8 × 10 <lb/> 24  y <lb/>on the <lb/> 130  Te 0νDBD half-life, corresponding to a limit of <lb/>0.2–1.1 eV on m  ν  , represents the best limit after those <lb/>reached by Ge diodes experiments (see table 3). <lb/>Half-way with next-generation experiments, NEMO <lb/>III [45] is a passive source detector located in the Fre-<lb/>jus underground laboratory at a depth of ∼ 4800 m.w.e. <lb/>It consists of a tracking (wire chambers filled with an <lb/>ethyl-alcohol mixture, operated in the Geiger mode) and <lb/>a calorimetric (1940 plastic scintillators) system operated <lb/>in a 30 gauss magnetic field. A well designed source sys-<lb/>tem allows the simultaneous analysis of up to 10 kg of dif-<lb/>ferent 0νDBD active isotopes. Despite a relatively mod-<lb/>est energy resolution (11% FWHM at 3 MeV), implying <lb/>a non-negligible background contribution from 2νDBD, <lb/>they achieved very good results on the study of the 2νDBD <lb/>spectra of several ββ emitters ( <lb/> 82  Se, <lb/> 96  Zr, <lb/> 116  Cd, <lb/> 150  Nd). <lb/>However, regarding the 0νDBD a good result was obtained <lb/>with <lb/> 100  Mo (see table 3). <lb/>In January 2002, a few members of the HM col-<lb/>laboration claimed evidence for <lb/> 76  Ge 0νDBD [46] with <lb/> T <lb/> 0ν <lb/>1/2  = 0.8–18.3 × 10 <lb/> 25  y (best value T <lb/> 0ν <lb/>1/2  = 1.5 × 10 <lb/> 25  y) <lb/>corresponding to a m  ν  range of 0.11–0.56 eV (best value <lb/>0.39 eV). This claim is based on the identification of tiny <lb/>peaks close to the 0νDBD region of <lb/> 76  Ge, one of them <lb/>at the energy of the Q-value of the DBD. However this <lb/>announcement raised immediate scepticism [47]. Several <lb/>reanalyses of the data were published by the claim&apos;s au-<lb/>thors [48,49,50,51], while other authors [52,53,54] still <lb/>criticize the claim. Probably a definite answer to the cor-<lb/>rectness of the claim will be given only by the very sensi-<lb/>tive next-generation 0νDBD projects. <lb/> 7 Towards second-generation experiments <lb/> We have seen that the field of 0νDBD searches is very ac-<lb/>tive. The goal of the future experiments is to reach sensi-<lb/>tivities capable of probing the inverted mass hierarchy, i.e. <lb/> sensitivities in the decay time of the order of ∼ 10 <lb/> 26  –10 <lb/> 27 <lb/> years. There are several possibilities in order to improve <lb/>the sensitivities of the experiments. It is up to the ex-<lb/>perimentalist to choose the philosophy of the experiment <lb/>and, consequently, to select the detector characteristics, <lb/>privileging some properties with respect to others, having <lb/>clearly in mind the final sensitivity of the set-up to half-life <lb/>and, consequently, to m  ν  . The question is: how to im-<lb/>prove the experiments? Most of the criteria that need to be <lb/>considered when optimizing the design of a new 0νDBD <lb/>experiment follow directly from eq. (10) combined with <lb/>eq. (3); the sensitivity at 68% CL on the neutrino mass, <lb/> F  0ν  , can be written as <lb/> F  0ν  = <lb/> m  e <lb/> √ <lb/> ln 2N  A <lb/> 1 <lb/> G  0ν  |M  0ν  |  2 <lb/> A <lb/>i.a..x <lb/> 4 <lb/> BΔE <lb/>Mt <lb/>. (11) <lb/> 7.1 Exposure time <lb/> The first consideration is that an &quot; improvement &quot; could <lb/>be simply reached with the present experiments just by <lb/>measuring for longer time; from eq. (11) we have <lb/> m  ν  |  t→∞  = m  ν   ΔT <lb/> ΔT <lb/>ΔT + t → ∞ <lb/>  1/4 <lb/> , <lb/> (12) <lb/>where ΔT is the measurement lifetime that has allowed <lb/>the present limit on m  ν   ΔT  . Now, almost all the ex-<lb/>periments (except the CUORICINO and NEMO III ex-<lb/>periments, that have, respectively, a lifetime of ΔT ∼ 4 <lb/>months and of ΔT ∼ 13 months) have ∼ ΔT ≥ 2 y. This <lb/>implies that to have an improvement of only a factor 2 in <lb/>the neutrino mass one has to measure ∼ 30 years! From <lb/>this consideration it is also clear that, generally, DBD ex-<lb/>periments have a, somewhat, &quot; short &quot; life. <lb/> 7.2 Mass <lb/> The mass is one of the &quot; parameters &quot; with which one needs <lb/>to deal. Regarding this point one has to consider also other <lb/>variables, i.e. the isotopic abundance. From table 3 we see <lb/>that all the interesting ββ emitters (except <lb/> 130  Te) have <lb/>isotopic abundances of the order of 5–10%. Let us con-<lb/>sider, for example, two experiments with the same envi-<lb/>ronmental natural background and with the same mass; <lb/>let us suppose that one has the ββ emitter with natural <lb/> i.a. (for example 5%) while the second has a 90% enrich-<lb/>ment; then, from eq. (11), it turns out that the sensitiv-<lb/>ity of the enriched experiment is a factor <lb/> 90/5 = 4.2 <lb/>better with respect to the other. This result can be seen <lb/>also from another point of view: the time needed for the <lb/></body>

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> non-enriched experiment to reach the sensitivity of the en-<lb/>riched one will be (90/5) <lb/> 2  = 324 times larger! This point <lb/>is crucial and, in fact, all the most sensitive experiments <lb/>carried out in the past (except the ones based on <lb/> 130  Te) <lb/>used enriched materials. This holds (see next section) also <lb/>for the next planned experiments. It is also clear that en-<lb/>richment is extremely expensive and raises tremendously <lb/>the cost of an experiment. <lb/>Another crucial point comes directly from eq. (9). <lb/>From table 1 it turns out that the decay time in order <lb/>to reach a sensitivity on neutrino mass of the order of <lb/>10 meV (the goal of the most ambitious next-generation <lb/>experiments) is of the order of 10 <lb/> 28  y. Thus, assuming a <lb/>measurement of three years, supposing to have zero back-<lb/>ground (it is clear that this is practically impossible) and <lb/>considering at least three events for the 0νDBD discovery, <lb/>then we need to have at least N <lb/>  * <lb/> ββ  = 10 <lb/> 28  / ln 2 ββ nuclei, <lb/>or ≈ 24·10 <lb/> 3  moles. It is therefore clear that the mass scale <lb/>for the second-generation experiments is of the order of a <lb/>ton. It is also clear that if no signal is detected with the <lb/>next experiments it will be necessary to cover the normal <lb/>hierarchy region, i.e. a few meV. Using the same argu-<lb/>ment it turns out that such third-generation experiments <lb/> (if any) should be able to reach decay times of the order <lb/>of ∼ 10 <lb/> 30  y with a mass of ∼ 100 ton. <lb/> 7.3 Background <lb/> The background is a very delicate point and repre-<lb/>sent the main task of DBD experiments. There are sev-<lb/>eral background sources that need to be taken into ac-<lb/>count. Cosmic-ray–induced background can, in principle, <lb/>be made negligible operating deep underground and us-<lb/>ing, furthermore, active shielding to discard events corre-<lb/>lated with the passage of a nearby muon. Neutron induced <lb/>background (mainly (n, γ) reactions) can also be lowered <lb/>to a negligible contribution by shielding the experimental <lb/>setup with suitable moderators/neutron-catchers. It turns <lb/>out, therefore, that the main source of background is the <lb/>one arising from the natural radioactivity (mainly <lb/> 232  Th <lb/>and <lb/> 238  U) overall present in traces in all kind of materials. <lb/>Therefore the main work in order to build an experiment is <lb/>the screening of materials used for the setup. The present <lb/>techniques are based on High-Purity Ge diodes, neutron <lb/>activation analysis (for solid and liquid samples), and <lb/>High-Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spec-<lb/>trometry (HR-ICPMS) for liquid samples. The best limits <lb/>that can be obtained with the first two techniques are <lb/>around 10 <lb/> −11  –10 <lb/> −12  g/g (grams of contaminant/grams of <lb/>sample) while 10 <lb/> −13  g/g can be reached on liquid samples. <lb/>Both techniques are extremely delicate and, moreover, ex-<lb/>tremely long: for Ge measurement the time needed in or-<lb/>der to reach such limits is of the order of several months. <lb/>Having screened all the samples of materials to be used <lb/>for the experiment, one has to assemble the setup. Assum-<lb/>ing that all the batches (also the ones that underwent me-<lb/>chanical machining) are as clean as the screened samples, <lb/>extreme care has to be used in order to avoid possible re-<lb/>contamination. Clean room operation is absolutely needed <lb/>and operation in &quot; synthetic &quot; air (without Radon) or under <lb/>clean atmosphere (pure nitrogen) is necessary. The back-<lb/>ground levels that need to be reached for the next experi-<lb/>ments (see sect. 8) require reduction of the order of 10–100 <lb/>(this means 10–1 c/(keV · ton · y)) with respect to the pre-<lb/>vious &quot; pilot &quot; experiments. These levels of radiopurity can-<lb/>not be directly tested with the standard techniques [55], so <lb/>that the only way to measure them will be the experiment <lb/>itself. Many physicists consider this somehow as &quot; bet &quot; . <lb/>Strictly connected with the background is also the <lb/>choice of the ββ emitter. Apart some extremely rare high <lb/>energy γ&apos;s from the <lb/> 238  U chain, the highest natural γ line <lb/>arising from natural radioactivity is the 2615 keV line of <lb/> 208  Tl (from <lb/> 232  Th chain). It would be, therefore, extremely <lb/>useful to choose a ββ emitter with a Q  ββ  value above this <lb/>energy. <lb/> 7.4 Energy resolution <lb/> Energy resolution will be the key point for some future ex-<lb/>periments. Apart from the obvious role played in eq. (11), <lb/>there is another fundamental aspect that has to be ad-<lb/>dressed. Assuming also the ability to reduce all the back-<lb/>ground sources, there is an intrinsic, unavoidable, undis-<lb/>tinguishable &quot; background &quot; : the 2νDBD. This source of <lb/>background did not play a reasonable role in the present <lb/>and past experiments due to the &quot; low &quot; sensitivity reached. <lb/>As pointed out in [56] the fraction F of 2νDBD events that <lb/>are contained in the ΔE <lb/> FWHM  energy window centred at <lb/>the Q  ββ  value is given by <lb/> F ≈ 7 <lb/> Q  ββ  δ <lb/> 6 <lb/> m  e <lb/> , δ = <lb/> ΔE <lb/> FWHM <lb/> Q  ββ <lb/> . <lb/> (13) <lb/>An expression for the 0νDBD signal (S) to the 2νDBD <lb/>background (B) ratio can be written <lb/> S <lb/>B <lb/> ≈ <lb/> m  e <lb/> 7Q  ββ  δ  6 <lb/> T <lb/> 2ν <lb/>1/2 <lb/> T  0ν <lb/>1/2 <lb/> . <lb/> (14) <lb/>For example, looking at table 3, taking T <lb/> 2ν <lb/>1/2  ≈ 10 <lb/> 20  y <lb/>and Q  ββ  ≈ 3 MeV, in order to reach a sensitivity on <lb/> T <lb/> 0ν <lb/>1/2  of the order of 10 <lb/> 27  (10 <lb/> 28  ) y with S/B = 1 the en-<lb/>ergy resolution should be less than 3.7 (2.5)% FWHM at <lb/>the Q  ββ  value. This energy resolution is extremely chal-<lb/>lenging for all detectors except Ge diodes and bolome-<lb/>ters that have, normally, energy resolutions of the order <lb/>of 0.2–0.4% FWHM. For the sake of completeness it has <lb/>to be noted that the S/B ratio can be slightly enhanced <lb/>by choosing an asymmetric analysis window defined as <lb/> Q  ββ  &lt; E &lt; Q  ββ  + ΔE <lb/> FWHM  . <lb/> 8 Future experiments <lb/> So far, the best results have been obtained by exploit-<lb/>ing the calorimetric approach (active source detectors) <lb/>which characterizes therefore most of the future proposed <lb/></body>

Actually, a series of new proposals has been <lb/>boosted by the recent renewed interest in 0νDBD follow-<lb/>ing neutrino oscillation results. It is not so easy to classify <lb/>them: <lb/>1. High energy resolution calorimetric experiments based <lb/>on already consolidated techniques with improvements <lb/>in background suppression/rejection (e.g. CUORE, <lb/>GERDA, MAJORANA). <lb/>2. Calorimetric experiments based on consolidated tech-<lb/>niques of scintillation light detection (CANDLES, <lb/>CAMEO). <lb/>3. Calorimetric experiments with or without background <lb/>identification techniques based on non-standard tech-<lb/>niques that require further R&amp;D (EXO, XMASS). <lb/>4. &quot; Passive &quot; experiments based on standard techniques <lb/>that requires R&amp;D (SUPERNEMO, MOON, DCBA). <lb/>Expected sensitivities on T <lb/> 0ν <lb/> 1/2  of the proposed projects <lb/>are compared in table 4. The sensitivities on m  ν  are eval-<lb/>uated using table 1. In many cases technical feasibility <lb/>tests are requested, but the crucial issue will be the capa-<lb/>bility of each project to pursue the expected background <lb/>suppression. <lb/>Many proposals have been recently suggested. However <lb/>most of them are not officially approved or require further <lb/>R&amp;D to actually prove the feasibility. A complete report <lb/>can be found in [67,68]. <lb/>GERDA [59] (GERmanium Detector Array) is the <lb/>only completely approved and funded experiment. It will <lb/>be carried on in the INFN Gran Sasso National Labo-<lb/>ratories. It is based on the technique already suggested <lb/>by the HM Collaboration [69]: &quot; naked &quot; Ge diodes will be <lb/>suspended in the centre of a very large liquid nitrogen <lb/>container, which will act as a very effective shield. The <lb/>experiment will consist of two phases: in the first one the <lb/> same detectors of the HM Collaboration and the IGEX <lb/>Collaboration will be &quot; naked &quot; , removing all the compo-<lb/>nents that are not needed for operating them in liquid <lb/>nitrogen. The total mass will be ∼ 17 kg of 86% enriched <lb/> 76  Ge. The collaboration will probe the HM claim within <lb/>the first 1–2 years. They plan to reach zero background <lb/>in the 0νDBD region. Therefore, if the result of the HM <lb/>Collaboration is true they will expect to confirm it at 5σ <lb/>CL within the first year of operation. The second phase <lb/>will consist of the addition of new enriched detectors for a <lb/>total mass of 60 kg (0.7 kmol). For the second phase they <lb/>will use background discrimination techniques and they, <lb/>again, quote zero background. The first phase should start <lb/>data taking in 2007. <lb/>CUORE [57] (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for <lb/>Rare Events) will be a larger extension of CUORICINO. <lb/>The experiment is scientifically approved and partially <lb/>funded. CUORE will consists of 25 CUORICINO-like tow-<lb/>ers with 988 5×5×5 cm <lb/> 3  TeO  2  non-enriched crystals. The <lb/>number of ββ nuclei will be 1.6 kmol. The construction of <lb/>a large custom cryostat, already funded, will start in 2006. <lb/>Among all the proposed experiments it is the only one that <lb/>needs a background suppression of &quot; only &quot; a factor 10 with <lb/>respect to the &quot; pilot &quot; CUORICINO experiment. A factor <lb/>of two was already achieved in 2004. The expected sen-<lb/>sitivity will be 7 · 10 <lb/> 26  y. The experiment should start in <lb/>2009. <lb/>MAJORANA [60], which involves many of the IGEX <lb/>collaborators, will consist of an array of 210 isotopically <lb/>enriched Ge diodes for a total mass of 0.5 tons. As op-<lb/>posed to the GERDA design, the use of a very low activity <lb/>conventional cryostat (extremely radiopure electroformed <lb/>Cu) able to host simultaneously a large number of diodes <lb/>is proposed. The driving principle behind the project is <lb/>a strong reduction of the background by the application <lb/>of very effective pulse-shape discrimination and the devel-<lb/>opment of special segmented detectors. Despite the very <lb/>promising R&amp;D developed in the last years, the project is <lb/>not yet funded. <lb/> 9 Conclusions <lb/> A renewed interest in 0νDBD has been stimulated by <lb/>recent neutrino oscillations results. Neutrinoless DBD is <lb/>finally recognized as a unique tool to measure neutrino <lb/>properties (nature, mass scale, intrinsic phases) unavail-<lb/>able for the successful experiments on neutrino oscilla-<lb/>tions. The attainability of such a goal strongly depends on <lb/>the true capability of these projects to reach the required <lb/>background levels in the 0νDBD region. An experimen-<lb/>tal confirmation of the (sometimes optimistic) background <lb/>predictions of the various projects (even if extrapolated <lb/>from the results of lower-scale successful experiments) is <lb/>therefore worthwhile and the construction of preliminary <lb/>test setups is absolutely needed. The ultra-low background <lb/>understanding is a very complicated issue that needs care-<lb/>ful investigations and experimental confirmation. The re-<lb/>cently claimed evidence for a 0νDBD signal in the HM <lb/>data seems still too weak but will be verified by the fu-<lb/>ture experiments. <lb/>A strong effort to improve the NME evaluation should <lb/>be encouraged while stressing the need of experiments ad-<lb/>dressed to different nuclei. <lb/></body>

After a short introduction on the low background liquid xenon DAMA set-up (DAMA/LXe) <lb/>and its main previous results, we discuss the search for the nucleon, di-nucleon and tri-nucleon decays <lb/>into invisible channels (disappearance or decay to neutrinos, Majorons, etc.) in the <lb/> 136  Xe isotope. The <lb/>obtained limits (90% C.L.) on the lifetimes are: τn &gt; 3.3 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr, τp &gt; 4.5 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr, τnp &gt; 3.2 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr, <lb/> τpp &gt; 1.9 · 10 <lb/> 24  yr, τnnp &gt; 1.4 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr, τnpp &gt; 2.7 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr and τppp &gt; 3.6 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr. In particular, the <lb/>tri-nucleon decay into invisible channels is investigated here for the first time. <lb/> PACS. 29.40.Mc Scintillation detectors – 95.35.+d Dark matter (stellar, interstellar, galactic, and cosmo-<lb/>logical) – 11.30.Fs Global symmetries (e.g., baryon number, lepton number) <lb/> 1 Introduction on previous results <lb/> The DAMA/LXe experiment has realized several proto-<lb/>type detectors and, then, has preliminarily put in mea-<lb/>surement the set-up used in the data taking of refs. [1,2]; <lb/>this set-up was firstly upgraded in fall 1995 as mentioned <lb/>in refs. [3,4,5,6,7]. In particular, it has an inner vessel <lb/>filled by  6.5 kg (i.e.  2 l) of liquid xenon. Firstly it used <lb/>Kr-free xenon enriched in <lb/> 129  Xe at 99.5% [8]; then, in 2000 <lb/>the set-up was deeply modified reaching the configuration <lb/>in fig. 5 of ref. [8] to handle also Kr-free xenon enriched <lb/>in <lb/> 136  Xe at 68.8% [9,10]. In this latter case, the interest <lb/>has mainly been focused on the higher energy region. The <lb/>main features of the set-up, details on the data acqui-<lb/>sition, on the cryogenic and vacuum systems and on the <lb/>running parameters control are described in [6,7,8,10,11]. <lb/>In particular, the energy scale in the high energy region <lb/>is determined with the help of external standard gamma <lb/>sources, having identified the possibility to perform high <lb/>energy calibrations with external sources near a flange lo-<lb/>cated on the top of the detector, opening a limited upper <lb/>part of the external shield. The energy resolution for <lb/> 208  Tl <lb/>line (E  γ  = 2614 keV) is σ  220 keV, while for <lb/> 137  Cs line <lb/>(E  γ  = 662 keV), which is the source usually exploited for <lb/>the routine calibrations, σ is  70 keV [10,11,7]. <lb/> a  e-mail: riccardo.cerulli@lngs.infn.it <lb/> We pointed out the interest in using liquid xenon as <lb/>target-detector for particle Dark Matter (DM) investiga-<lb/>tion deep underground since long time [12]. After pre-<lb/>liminary measurements both on elastic and inelastic DM <lb/>particles-<lb/> 129  Xe scattering [1,3], the recoil/electron light <lb/>ratio and pulse shape discrimination capability in a similar <lb/>pure LXe scintillator have been measured both with Am-<lb/>B neutron source and with 14 MeV ENEA-Frascati neu-<lb/>tron generator [6]. Moreover, in 2000/2001 further mea-<lb/>surements on the recoil/electron light ratio with 2.5 MeV <lb/>ENEA-Frascati neutron generator have also been carried <lb/>out; see ref. [5] for details and comparisons. <lb/>After upgrading of the LXe set-up, new results on <lb/>the DM particles investigation have been obtained [4,6]. <lb/>In particular, in ref. [6] pulse shape discrimination be-<lb/>tween recoils and electromagnetic background in the de-<lb/>veloped pure LXe scintillators has been exploited. After-<lb/>wards the inelastic excitation of <lb/> 129  Xe by DM particles <lb/>with spin-dependent coupling has further been investi-<lb/>gated in ref. [4]. <lb/>Several other rare processes have also been searched <lb/>for by means of the detector filled with the Kr-free xenon <lb/>gas enriched in <lb/> 129  Xe. In particular, as regards the elec-<lb/>tron stability, limits on the lifetime of the electron decay <lb/>in both the disappearance and the ν  e  +γ channels were set <lb/>in ref. [2]. The latter has been more recently improved up <lb/>to 2.0(3.4) · 10 <lb/> 26  yr at 90% (68%) C.L. [13]. Furthermore, <lb/></body>

			<body> new lifetime limits on the charge non-conserving electron <lb/>capture with excitation of <lb/> 129  Xe nuclear levels have also <lb/>been established to be in the range (1–4) · 10 <lb/> 24  yr at 90% <lb/>C.L. for the different excited levels of <lb/> 129  Xe [14]. The strin-<lb/>gent restrictions on the relative strengths of charge non-<lb/>conserving (CNC) processes have been consequently de-<lb/>rived: <lb/> 2 <lb/> W  &lt; 2.2·10 <lb/> −26  and <lb/> 2 <lb/> γ  &lt; 1.3·10 <lb/> −42  at 90% C.L. [14]. <lb/>Moreover, we have searched for the nucleon and di-<lb/>nucleon decay into invisible channels in the <lb/> 129  Xe isotope <lb/>by exploiting a new approach [15]. It consisted in a search <lb/>(in the real-time experiment) for radioactive decay of un-<lb/>stable daughter nuclei which were created in result of the <lb/> N or NN disappearance in parent nucleus. If the half-life <lb/>of the daughter nucleus is of the order of 1 s or greater, <lb/>such a decay will be time-resolved from prompt products <lb/>if they were emitted and observed in a detector. This ap-<lb/>proach has the advantage of a branching ratio close to 1 <lb/>and —if the parent and daughter nuclei are located in the <lb/>detector itself— also of an efficiency close to 1. The ob-<lb/>tained limits at 90% C.L. are: τ (p → invisible channels) &gt; <lb/> 1.9 · 10 <lb/> 24  yr; τ (pp → invisible channels) &gt; 5.5 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr and <lb/> τ (nn → invisible channels) &gt; 1.2 · 10 <lb/> 25  yr. These limits <lb/>are similar to or better than those previously available; <lb/>moreover, they are valid for every possible disappearance <lb/>channel [15] and the limits for the di-nucleon decay in ν  τ  ¯ <lb/> ν  τ <lb/> are set there for the first time. <lb/>Afterwards, measurements have been carried out by <lb/>using the Kr-free xenon gas containing 17.1% of <lb/> 134  Xe and <lb/>68.8% of <lb/> 136  Xe to investigate the <lb/> 134  Xe and <lb/> 136  Xe double <lb/>beta decay modes. After the preliminary results of refs. [9, <lb/>16] a joint analysis of the 0νββ decay mode in <lb/> 134  Xe and <lb/>in <lb/> 136  Xe (as suggested in ref. [17]) has been carried out. <lb/>New lower limits on various ββ decay modes have been ob-<lb/>tained: for the 0νββ(0 <lb/> + <lb/> → 0 <lb/> +  ) decay mode in <lb/> 134  Xe and <lb/>in <lb/> 136  Xe the limits at 90% C.L. are T  1/2  = 5.8 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr <lb/>and T  1/2  = 1.2 · 10 <lb/> 24  yr, respectively; they correspond to <lb/>a limit value on effective light Majorana neutrino mass <lb/> ranging from 1.1 eV to 2.9 eV (90% C.L.), depending on <lb/>the adopted theoretical model. For the neutrinoless dou-<lb/>ble beta decay with Majoron (M ) in the <lb/> 136  Xe isotope <lb/>the limit is T  1/2  = 5.0 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr (90% C.L.); for the <lb/>2νββ(0 <lb/> + <lb/> → 0 <lb/> +  ) and the 2νββ(0 <lb/> + <lb/> → 2 <lb/> +  ) decay modes <lb/>in <lb/> 136  Xe the limits at 90% C.L. are 1.0 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr and <lb/>9.4 · 10 <lb/> 21  yr, respectively. It is worthy to note that the ex-<lb/>perimental limit on the 2νββ(0 <lb/> + <lb/> → 0 <lb/> +  ) decay mode is in <lb/>the range of the theoretical estimate by [18] (2.11 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr) <lb/>and about a factor 5 higher than that of ref. [19] <lb/> 1  . <lb/>A search for the charge non-conserving decay of <lb/> 136  Xe <lb/>into <lb/> 136  Cs has also been performed for the first time [7], <lb/>using the data collected during 8823.54 h and already pub-<lb/>lished in ref. [10]. The used approach has been the in-<lb/>vestigation of the CNC processes by the search for the <lb/>possible CNC decay firstly considered in [20]: if in a β <lb/> decay (A, Z) → (A, Z + 1) + e <lb/> −  + ν  e  some massless un-<lb/>charged particle would be emitted instead of the electron <lb/>(e.g., ν  e  or γ or Majoron), an additional 511 keV energy <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 1  On the other hand, similar theoretical estimates suffer from <lb/>the large uncertainties typically associated to the calculations <lb/>of the nuclear matrix elements. <lb/></note>

			<body> release would occur. Thus, usually forbidden decays to <lb/>the ground state or to the excited levels of the daugh-<lb/>ter nuclei would become energetically possible. The pres-<lb/>ence of the (A, Z + 1) isotope or of its daughter products <lb/>in a sample, initially free from them, would indicate the <lb/>existence of the CNC decay searched for. Large advan-<lb/>tages arise when the so-called &quot; active-source &quot; technique <lb/>(source = detector) is considered as in the case described <lb/>here. In particular, after the possible <lb/> 136  Xe CNC decay, <lb/>the daughter nucleus <lb/> 136  Cs will be created. It is β un-<lb/>stable (T  1/2  = 13.16 d) with quite high energy release <lb/>(Q  β  = 2.548 MeV) [7]. Comparing the experimental en-<lb/>ergy distribution with the expected response function, no <lb/>evidence for the effect searched for has been found. Thus, <lb/>the lifetime limit is: τ  CNC  ( <lb/> 136  Xe → <lb/> 136  Cs) &gt; 1.3 · 10 <lb/> 23  yr <lb/>at 90% C.L. This limit is one of the highest available limits <lb/>for similar processes [7]; however, the bound on the charge <lb/>non-conserving admixture in the weak interactions, which <lb/>can be derived according to ref. [21], is modest mainly due <lb/>to the big change in nuclear spin in the considered CNC <lb/>transition (ΔJ <lb/> Δπ  = 5 <lb/> +  ). <lb/> 2 The search for nucleon instabilities into <lb/>invisible channels in the <lb/> 136 Xe isotope <lb/> The baryon number (B) conservation was introduced by <lb/>Stuckelberg [22] and Wigner [23] more than fifty years <lb/>ago and remains an accidental symmetry of the Stan-<lb/>dard Model, when this is seen as a renormalizable theory, <lb/>not explained by deeper theoretical understanding. Mod-<lb/>ern theories of particle physics (GUTs, SUSY), unifying <lb/>quarks and leptons into the same multiplets and predict-<lb/>ing new interactions which transform quarks into leptons, <lb/>naturally lead to the decay of the protons and the oth-<lb/>erwise stable bound neutrons [24]. Many decay mecha-<lb/>nisms, which violate B on one or two units, have been <lb/>discussed [24,25]. In a recent work [26], a new process <lb/>was examined in which two neutrons simultaneously de-<lb/>cay to bulk Majoron, nn → M , with typical lifetime 10 <lb/> 32  – <lb/>10 <lb/> 39  yr; due to weak coupling of Majorons to normal mat-<lb/>ter they are not detected in an experiment, and such a <lb/>process looks as a disappearance of two neutrons from a <lb/>nucleus. Also mechanisms for the tri-nucleon decay have <lb/>been proposed in the literature; in particular, very recently <lb/>in ref. [27] also tri-nucleon decay processes with ΔB = 3 <lb/>have been considered. Moreover, disappearance of parti-<lb/>cles (electrons, e <lb/> −  , or nucleons, N ) are expected also in <lb/>theories with extra dimensions [28,29,30]. No processes <lb/>with baryon number violation were detected to date. We <lb/>refer to our previous article [15] for a review of various <lb/>ideas used in the search for the N and NN decays into <lb/>invisible channels. <lb/>Here a search for the N , NN and NNN instabilities <lb/>in the <lb/> 136  Xe isotope is described, looking for decays of the <lb/>unstable daughter nuclei. The experimental energy distri-<lb/>bution collected during 8823.54 h by the LXe scintillator <lb/>(enriched in <lb/> 136  Xe at 68.8%) in the energy region 550– <lb/>3550 keV (the same as in refs. [10] and [7]) is shown later. <lb/></body>

As a consequence, a correction <lb/>(which depends on the used hardware cut in high energy <lb/>measurements) estimated by Monte Carlo program, prop-<lb/>erly considering the real geometry and the features of the <lb/>detector, has been applied to the rate. <lb/>The isotopes given in table 1 are produced [31] after <lb/>the disappearance of one, two or three nucleons in the par-<lb/>ent <lb/> 136 <lb/>54  Xe nucleus, when the daughter de-excitation occurs <lb/>only by γ emission. In general, the created daughter nu-<lb/>cleus —with one, two or three holes in nuclear shells due <lb/>to disappeared nucleons— will be in an excited state, un-<lb/>less the nucleons were on the outermost shell. The holes <lb/>will be filled in the subsequent de-excitation process in <lb/>which different particles could be emitted. If the excita-<lb/>tion energy is lower than the binding energy of the least <lb/>bound nucleon, only γ quanta will be emitted; otherwise, <lb/>heavy particles such as p, n or α will be ejected leading to <lb/>daughter nuclei with lower atomic masses and numbers. <lb/>In that follows we will take into account the N , NN and <lb/> NNN disappearance from a few outermost shells in the <lb/>parent nucleus, when only γ&apos;s would be emitted, avoiding <lb/>in this way uncertainty in created daughter nuclide. <lb/>The lifetimes for the N , NN and NNN disappearance <lb/>in <lb/> 136  Xe can be calculated using the formula: <lb/> τ = <lb/>  ΔE  · N  nucl  · N <lb/> eff <lb/>obj  · T <lb/>S  ΔE <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where N  nucl  = 2.00 · 10 <lb/> 25  is the number of <lb/> 136  Xe nuclei; <lb/> T = 8823.54 h is the time of measurement; N <lb/> eff <lb/>obj  is the <lb/> &quot; effective &quot; number of objects (n, p, NN pairs or NNN <lb/> Table 2.

[15]. As regards the NNN decays <lb/>into invisible channels, there is no available information <lb/>from previous search and, in particular, there are no ref-<lb/>erence criteria to evaluate N <lb/> eff <lb/>obj  in these cases. Thus, in <lb/>the search we have carried out, we cautiously assumed <lb/> N <lb/> eff <lb/>obj  = 1 for all the NNN processes (nnn, nnp, npp and <lb/> ppp), as done in the search for the NN decays into invisible <lb/>channels in ref. [32]. The used values of N <lb/> eff <lb/>obj  are summa-<lb/>rized in table 2. Referring to table 1, we note that, except <lb/>for the <lb/> 134  Xe nucleus which is stable and does not allow <lb/>us to search for the nn disappearance, all other daugh-<lb/>ter nuclei are radioactive. In the subsequent decays (third <lb/>column of table 1), if we exclude the <lb/> 135  Cs which has <lb/> T  1/2  = 2.3·10 <lb/> 6  yr and breaks the decay chain, the half-lives <lb/>of the involved nuclides are relatively small. This ensures <lb/>equilibrium in chains and thus equal number of decays for <lb/> 135  I and <lb/> 135  Xe (in case of the p disappearance), for <lb/> 134  Te <lb/>and <lb/> 134  I (pp decay), etc. The expected response functions <lb/>of the LXe detector for the β <lb/> −  decays of the nuclei in-<lb/>volved in the decay chains were simulated with the help <lb/>of the EGS4 package [33]. The whole schemes of the de-<lb/>cays, using the information from ref. [34] for the A = 133 <lb/>isotopes, from ref. [35] for the A = 134 isotopes and from <lb/>ref. [36] for the A = 135 isotopes, were implemented in <lb/>an event generator which described the initial kinematics <lb/>of the events. The response functions for the N , NN and <lb/> NNN disappearance are given by a linear combination of <lb/>the response functions obtained for the single decays of <lb/>the generated decay chain. Comparison of the experimen-<lb/>tal spectrum with the calculated response functions gives <lb/>no strong indication of the signals searched for. Thus, we <lb/>limit ourselves to extract only the limits on the proba-<lb/>bility of these processes. We will see that, except for the <lb/> np and pp channel, the calculated response function do <lb/>not present any distinctive structure, as a peak, at en-<lb/>ergies above the experimental energy threshold (550 keV) <lb/>but their shapes are similar to some extent to that of the <lb/>measured spectrum. As a consequence, the limit on the <lb/>amplitude of the expected response function, which can <lb/>be hidden in the experimental data, was determined in a <lb/>very cautious and simple way (used also in the investiga-<lb/>tion of other rare processes). In fact, it has been required <lb/>that —in no energy interval, ΔE— the number of events <lb/>which could be ascribed to the investigated process, S  ΔE  , <lb/></body>

In the data analysis we considered the 550– <lb/>700 keV energy region of the experimental spectrum (see <lb/>fig. 1 left), where 369 events were accumulated.

As evident, the maximum <lb/>energy released in this process is below the 550 keV energy <lb/>threshold of the present measurements; thus, this decay <lb/>process cannot be investigated here. <lb/>As a consequence of a nnp disappearance in the <lb/> 136  Xe <lb/>nucleus, a <lb/> 133  I nucleus is instead created in the sensitive <lb/>volume of DAMA/LXe. This isotope is the parent of the <lb/> β <lb/> −  decay chain <lb/> 133  I → <lb/> 133  Xe → <lb/> 133  Cs. The energy dis-<lb/>tribution expected for the <lb/> 133  I β <lb/> −  decay (T  1/2  = 20.8 h <lb/>and Q  β  −  = 1770 keV) in our liquid xenon set-up is mainly <lb/>determined by the β <lb/> −  decay with end-point ∼ 1240 keV <lb/>(83% of the cases) followed by a 530 keV de-excitation γ <lb/> 2  Other parameterizations gave similar results. <lb/> (the β <lb/> −  energy distribution is moved towards higher en-<lb/>ergy of 530 keV); a 233 keV peak is instead due to the de-<lb/>excitation of the <lb/> 133  Xe metastable state (T  1/2  = 2.19 d), <lb/>which is reached by the ∼ 3% of the decays [11]. The signal <lb/>to be searched for in case of a nnp disappearance in <lb/> 136  Xe <lb/>is given by the <lb/> 133  I+ <lb/> 133  Xe β <lb/> −  decay distributions but the <lb/>last one in the analysis does not play any role since it falls <lb/>under the experimental energy threshold (550 keV). <lb/>The more selective region in the present case is ΔE = <lb/>1100–1150 keV (see fig. 3 left); it contains 35 events, which <lb/>gives rise to the upper limit (90% C.L.) S  ΔE  &lt; 42.6 events <lb/>and being  ΔE  = 3.0% gives: <lb/> τ  nnp  &gt; 1.4 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr at 90% C.L. <lb/>(6) <lb/>In the case of the process npp → invisible channels in <lb/>the <lb/> 136  Xe nucleus, a <lb/> 133  Te nucleus is created. This isotope <lb/>(T  1/2  = 12.5 m and Q  β  −  = 2920 keV) produces a β <lb/> −  decay <lb/>to <lb/> 133  I followed by the decay chain <lb/> 133  I → <lb/> 133  Xe → <lb/> 133  Cs <lb/>already described above for the nnp channel. The simu-<lb/>lation result for a <lb/> 133  Te decay in the DAMA/LXe detec-<lb/>tor gives peculiar structures in the expected distribution <lb/>determined by the γ&apos;s emitted in the <lb/> 133  I de-excitation, <lb/>whose energies are summed to the initial β <lb/> −  of <lb/> 133  Te. <lb/>The more probable emitted γ&apos;s are those with energies <lb/>312 keV (62%) and 408 keV (27%), from the first two ex-<lb/>cited levels of <lb/> 133  I. In fact, a bump at ∼ 300 keV is due <lb/>to the γ at 312 keV which, in most cases, releases all its <lb/>energy in the detector, while a bump at ∼ 700 keV is due <lb/>to the sum of the energies released by the two γ&apos;s emitted <lb/>in cascade. Each possible npp decay in <lb/> 136  Xe is associated <lb/>to a signal given by the sum of the energy distributions <lb/>expected for the β <lb/> −  decays of the <lb/> 133  Te, of the <lb/> 133  I and of <lb/>the <lb/> 133  Xe (this latter, as already mentioned, gives here a <lb/>signal under the experimental energy threshold and, there-<lb/>fore, is not considered) [11]. Comparing the experimental <lb/>spectrum measured (see fig. 3 center) and the expected <lb/>signal, one gets that the more selective energy window is <lb/> ΔE = 1100–1150 keV which contains 35 events, giving rise <lb/>to the upper limit: S  ΔE  &lt; 42.6 events (90% C.L.). Taking <lb/>into account the calculated efficiency  ΔE  = 5.7%, one can <lb/>derive <lb/> τ  npp  &gt; 2.7 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr at 90% C.L. <lb/>(7) <lb/>Finally, a possible ppp → invisible channels decay in <lb/> 136  Xe <lb/>will create in the liquid xenon the <lb/> 133  Sb nucleus which <lb/> β <lb/> −  decays with T  1/2  = 2.5 m and Q  β  −  = 4003 keV.

As re-<lb/>gards the response function of DAMA/LXe for the β <lb/> − <lb/> decay of <lb/> 133  Sb, it is more difficult to identify the struc-<lb/>ture due to the γ&apos;s emitted in the daughter nucleus de-<lb/>excitation. In fact, the more probable γ&apos;s have energies <lb/>of the order of MeV and, therefore, they can escape the <lb/>detector releasing only a part of their energy. The last <lb/>process in (8) is the <lb/> 133m  Te decay (T  1/2  = 55.4 m). The <lb/>expected energy distribution for the <lb/> 133m  Te decay process <lb/>gives a 334 keV peak due to the de-excitation γ, which in <lb/>the 17.5% of the cases move the <lb/> 133m  Te into the ground <lb/>state of <lb/> 133  Te; the remaining part of the expected signal <lb/>(branching ratio = 82.5%) is instead given by the <lb/> 133m  Te <lb/> β <lb/> −  decay (Q  β  −  = 2920 keV) to <lb/> 133  I. In particular, the <lb/>presence of the <lb/> 133  I metastable state at 1634 keV with <lb/> T  1/2  = 9 s induces other peaks in the expected energy dis-<lb/>tribution (a 74 keV peak which can be well distinguished, <lb/>but also peaks at 721 keV, 987 keV and 1634 keV) [11]. The <lb/>signal expected for the ppp → invisible channels in <lb/> 136  Xe <lb/>can be obtained by summing according to (8) the obtained <lb/>energy distributions [11] (we remind that the signal associ-<lb/>ated to the <lb/> 133  Xe decay is below the experimental thresh-<lb/>old 550 keV). Considering the expected energy distribu-<lb/>tion (see fig. 3 right), the most sensitive energy window <lb/>is ΔE = 1100–1150 keV which contains 35 events, giving <lb/>rise to the upper limit: S  ΔE  &lt; 42.6 events (90% C.L.); the <lb/>detection efficiency is:  ΔE  = 7.6%. One obtains <lb/> τ  ppp  &gt; 3.6 · 10 <lb/> 22  yr at 90% C.L. <lb/>(9) <lb/> 3 Conclusion <lb/> The DAMA/LXe set-up, deeply improved several times, <lb/>has allowed to achieve competitive results in the search for <lb/>various rare processes as summarized in the first section <lb/>of this paper. <lb/>Here in particular, the most recent results on nucleon <lb/>decays into invisible channels in the <lb/> 136  Xe isotope have <lb/> Table 3. Experimental limits (90% C.L.) obtained by <lb/>DAMA/LXe on the lifetime values of N , NN and NNN de-<lb/>cays into invisible channels in the <lb/> 136  Xe isotope. <lb/>Decay <lb/> τ  limit  years (90% C.L.) <lb/> n <lb/> 3.3 · 10 <lb/> 23 <lb/> p <lb/> 4.5 · 10 <lb/> 23 <lb/> nn <lb/> − <lb/> np <lb/> 3.2 · 10 <lb/> 23 <lb/> pp <lb/> 1.9 · 10 <lb/> 24 <lb/> nnn <lb/> − <lb/> nnp <lb/> 1.4 · 10 <lb/> 22 <lb/> npp <lb/> 2.7 · 10 <lb/> 22 <lb/> ppp <lb/> 3.6 · 10 <lb/> 22 <lb/> been discussed. The considered experimental approach as-<lb/>sures a high detection efficiency and a branching ratio ∼ 1 <lb/>with respect to other different approaches that used very <lb/>large mass installations to compensate for the much lower <lb/>values for those quantities. In particular, NNN decays <lb/>into invisible channels have been investigated here for the <lb/>first time. The obtained results are summarized in table 3. <lb/>All the limits achieved here are valid for every invisible de-<lb/>cay channel, including disappearance in extra-dimensions <lb/>or decay into particles which weakly interact with matter. <lb/>Further data taking is foreseen. <lb/></body>

We show that low-energy beta beams are very well suited to obtain information about supernova-<lb/>neutrino interactions. Linear combinations of low-energy beta-beam spectra are fitted to supernova-<lb/>neutrino energy distributions. The resulting synthetic spectra are able to reproduce the response of a <lb/>nuclear target to an incoming supernova neutrino flux in a very accurate way. This can provide impor-<lb/>tant information about the neutrino response in a terrestrial detector. We illustrate this technique using <lb/>deuterium and <lb/> 16  O as target material. The procedure provides an easy and straightforward way to ap-<lb/>ply the results of a beta-beam neutrino-nucleus measurement to a supernova neutrino detector, virtually <lb/>eliminating potential uncertainties due to nuclear-structure calculations. <lb/> PACS. 25.30.Pt Neutrino scattering – 26.50.+x Nuclear physics aspects of novae, supernovae, and other <lb/>explosive environments – 97.60.Bw Supernovae – 13.15.+g Neutrino interactions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The supernova problem is a longstanding one. Since an-<lb/>cient times, literature has reported the observation of sud-<lb/>denly appearing bright new objects in the sky. While the <lb/>name of the phenomenon reflects the confusion the ori-<lb/>gin of these events caused, today the general nature of <lb/>core-collapse supernovae is understood. Notwithstanding <lb/>the progress that has been made, the modeling of core-<lb/>collapse supernova events and in particular the genera-<lb/>tion of successful explosions still seems to face major prob-<lb/>lems. The neutrinos from supernova 1987A confirmed that <lb/>weak interactions play an important role in the explosion <lb/>mechanism. Hence, neutrinos from the next galactic core-<lb/>collapse supernova are much anticipated, since they are <lb/>the only particles giving us the chance to see deep into <lb/>the center of the event and shed light on the processes <lb/>driving the explosion mechanism. <lb/>The terrestrial detection of supernova neutrinos can <lb/>provide a broad variety of information [1,2]. The arrival <lb/>times of the neutrinos are related to their mass and can <lb/>moreover hint at the fate of the star [2,3]. Several reactions <lb/>provide directional information, important for optical tele-<lb/>scopes awaiting the photons in the wake of the supernova <lb/>neutrino flux. The energy of the neutrinos can be inferred <lb/>from the energy of the decay products. It indicates the de-<lb/> a  e-mail: natalie.jachowicz@ugent.be <lb/> b  e-mail: Gail McLaughlin@ncsu.edu <lb/> coupling site of the neutrinos and the temperature there. <lb/>As mu and tau supernova neutrinos do not have enough <lb/>energy to produce a massive lepton in a charged-current <lb/>reaction, the flavor of the arriving neutrinos can be in-<lb/>ferred from the frequency differences between the occur-<lb/>rence of neutral and charge-exchange processes. Whether <lb/>a neutrino or an antineutrino entered the detector can <lb/>be determined by looking at the charge of the outgoing <lb/>lepton for electron (anti)neutrinos or by examining the <lb/>spin of the outgoing nucleon in neutral-current nucleon <lb/>knockout off nuclei [4,5]. When the signal in the detector <lb/>is accurately resolved, the observed neutrino energies and <lb/>flavors can help to disentangle the mixing scheme induced <lb/>by oscillations [6,7,8]. <lb/>Nuclei have relatively large cross-sections for neutrino <lb/>reactions and are energy-sensitive in the range of inter-<lb/>est, several particle-emission thresholds opening up with <lb/>increasing incoming neutrino energies. This makes nu-<lb/>clear targets important as detecting material. Galactic <lb/>supernova neutrinos could be detected by existing and <lb/>proposed supernova neutrino detectors such as SNO [9], <lb/>SuperKamiokande [10], KamLAND [1], LVD [11], Mini-<lb/>BooNe [12], OMNIS [13], LAND [14], and LENA [15]. <lb/>Favored detection nuclei are <lb/> 12  C, <lb/> 16  O, <lb/> 56  Fe, <lb/> 208  Pb, and <lb/>deuterium. However, the signal in the detector can only <lb/>be interpreted as well as the relevant neutrino-nucleus <lb/>cross-sections are understood. For most nuclei very little <lb/>experimental neutrino data exists in the relevant energy <lb/></body>

This is due to the very small cross-sections for <lb/>weak-interaction processes, and an additional limitation <lb/>is caused by the fact that monochromatic neutrino beams <lb/>are not available [16,17]. This has as a consequence that <lb/>for most applications one has to rely on theoretical predic-<lb/>tions, with their related uncertainties and model depen-<lb/>dencies [18]. <lb/>Beta beams, which are neutrino beams produced by <lb/>the beta decay of nuclei that have been accelerated to high <lb/>gamma factor, were original proposed for high-energy ap-<lb/>plications, such as the measurement of the third neutrino <lb/>mixing angle θ  13  [19]. Volpe [20,21,22] suggested that a <lb/>beta beam run at lower gamma factor, would be useful <lb/>for neutrino measurements in the tens of MeV range. <lb/>We suggest exploiting the flexibility these beta-beam <lb/>facilities offer [23], combined with the fact that beta-beam <lb/>neutrino energies overlap with supernova neutrino ener-<lb/>gies, to construct &quot; synthetic &quot; spectra that approximate <lb/>an incoming supernova neutrino energy distribution. Us-<lb/>ing these constructed spectra we are able to reproduce <lb/>total and differential folded supernova neutrino cross-sec-<lb/>tions very accurately. <lb/> 2 Synthetic spectra <lb/> Traditionally, supernova neutrino energy distributions <lb/>were parametrized using Fermi-Dirac distributions. The <lb/>spectra are however not purely thermal, as the decoupling <lb/>sites of the neutrinos are influenced by their flavor and <lb/>energy, leading to the use of &quot; effective temperatures &quot; and <lb/> &quot; effective chemical potentials &quot; in these distributions. Re-<lb/>cent calculations showed that descriptions of a supernova <lb/>neutrino spectrum are provided by a power law distribu-<lb/>tion [24]: <lb/> n  SN[ε,α]  (ε) = <lb/> ε <lb/> ε <lb/>  α <lb/> e <lb/> −(α+1) <lb/> ε <lb/> ε  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where ε and α represent the average energy and the <lb/>width of the spectrum, respectively. The average neutrino <lb/>energy ε is related to the temperature at the decou-<lb/>pling site, and the effect of α is equivalent to that of <lb/>the introduction of the effective chemical potential in the <lb/>Fermi-Dirac distribution. Neutrino-nucleus reaction cross-<lb/>sections depend on the square of the incoming energy, thus <lb/>rising very fast with neutrino energies. Hence, the folded <lb/>cross-sections reach their maximum at much higher energy <lb/>values than the supernova neutrino energy spectrum does. <lb/>Typically even neutrinos with energies more than twice <lb/> 0 <lb/> 20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>n(ε <lb/> ν  ) <lb/> ε ν  (MeV) <lb/> γ=3 <lb/>γ=5 <lb/>γ=7 <lb/>γ=9 <lb/>γ=11 <lb/>γ=13 <lb/>γ=15 <lb/> 0 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>n(ε <lb/> ν  ) <lb/> ε ν  (MeV) <lb/> − − − α=3.0 <lb/>−−−− α=2.0 <lb/>......... α=4.0 <lb/> &lt;ε  ν  &gt;=14 MeV <lb/>&lt;ε  ν  &gt;=22 MeV <lb/>0 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>n(ε <lb/> ν  ) <lb/> ε ν  (MeV) <lb/> α=3.0 <lb/> &lt;ε  ν  &gt;=10 MeV <lb/>&lt;ε  ν  &gt;=14 MeV <lb/>&lt;ε  ν  &gt;=18 MeV <lb/>&lt;ε  ν  &gt;=22 MeV <lb/>&lt;ε  ν  &gt;=26 MeV <lb/> Fig. 1.

This <lb/>makes the high-energy tail of the spectra very important <lb/>for the determination of the nuclear response [26]. Fig-<lb/>ure 1 illustrates these distributions and compares them to <lb/>beta-beam spectra at low gammas. The precise shape of <lb/>the beta-beam spectra depends on the boost factor γ of <lb/>the primary ion beam and the opening angle of the flux to <lb/>the target, but is remarkably similar to the supernova neu-<lb/>trino energy distribution. Both classes of distributions are <lb/>characterized by long tails. The range of the low-energy <lb/>beta-beam spectra covers the energy region of interest for <lb/>supernova neutrinos. <lb/>We exploit the flexibility offered by beta-beam facili-<lb/>ties to construct linear combinations of beta-beam energy <lb/>distributions, <lb/> n  Nγ  (ε  i  ) = <lb/> N <lb/> i=1 <lb/> a  i  n  γi  (ε  i  ), <lb/>(2) <lb/>where all distributions involved were normalized to 1: <lb/> dε  i  n  Nγ  (ε  i  ) = 1 , <lb/> (3) <lb/>and <lb/> dε  i  n  γi  (ε  i  ) = 1, ∀i . <lb/> (4) <lb/>The constructed spectrum that represents the best fit to <lb/>the original supernova spectrum is then obtained by min-<lb/>imizing the expression <lb/> εi <lb/> dε  i  |n  Nγ  (ε  i  ) − n  SN  (ε  i  )| , <lb/> (5) <lb/>where the similarities between beta-beam and supernova <lb/>neutrino spectra assure that a good fit is easily obtained. <lb/>In this way, the values for the expansion parameters a  i  and <lb/>the boost factors γ  i  that yield a spectrum that is as close <lb/>as possible to the original power law distribution are de-<lb/>termined.

The parameters are shown <lb/>for constructions with three and five beta-beam spectra in <lb/>the fit of eq. (5). Whilst the main contribution stems from <lb/>spectra at low gamma, contributions from higher gammas <lb/>are very important for the reproduction of the spectrum&apos;s <lb/>tail. This is illustrated in fig. 2. There we show the original <lb/>power law spectra, together with the N = 3 and N = 5 <lb/>fits, and the respective folded cross-sections for neutral-<lb/>current scattering off <lb/> 16  O as a function of incident neu-<lb/>trino energy. The figure clearly illustrates that the folded <lb/>cross-section reaches its main strength for neutrinos in the <lb/>high-energy part of the distribution. Therefore, it is im-<lb/>portant that the addition of some spectra at higher γ in <lb/>the fit assures a good agreement between the constructed <lb/>and the original spectrum in this energy region. The min-<lb/>imization procedure indeed fulfills this demand: whereas <lb/>the peak of the fitted spectrum is slightly shifted to higher <lb/>energies, the agreement between the folded cross-sections <lb/>is rather satisfying. Including five beta-beam spectra in <lb/>the construction clearly improves the performances of the <lb/>minimization procedure at higher energies. <lb/> 3 Detector response <lb/> Of course the spectrum as such is not an important observ-<lb/>able. The information brought along by supernova neutri-<lb/>nos is encoded in the response of the detector to the in-<lb/>coming neutrino flux. This quantity is determined by the <lb/>folded differential cross-section: the folded cross-section as <lb/>a function of the excitation energy of the target indicates <lb/>what the neutrino signal in the detector will look like. <lb/>In fig. 3, we show the differential cross-section for <lb/>neutral-current neutrino scattering on an <lb/> 16  O target for <lb/>different energy distributions. The agreement between <lb/>cross-sections folded with the power law supernova neu-<lb/>trino spectrum and those folded with the synthetic spec-<lb/>trum is remarkably good. The procedure is able to repro-<lb/>duce total strength, and the position and width of the <lb/>resonances very accurately. <lb/></body>

Comparison between differential cross-sections for the charged-current reaction νe + d → p + p + e <lb/> −  , folded with a power <lb/>law supernova neutrino spectrum (full line) and synthetic spectra with 5 components, using gamma factors ranging from 5 to <lb/>15 (dotted line) and including lower energy beta-beam spectra with γ = 2 to 15 (dashed line), for different energy distributions: <lb/> ε = 14 MeV, α = 3 (a), ε = 22 MeV, α = 3 (b), ε = 18 MeV, α = 2 (c), and ε = 18 MeV, α = 4 (d). The deuteron <lb/>cross-sections were obtained from [29]. <lb/> In principle, the formalism can be applied to any target <lb/>material. Its efficiency, however, depends on the accuracy <lb/>of the fitting procedure in the relevant energy range. Fig-<lb/>ure 4 illustrates differential cross-sections for the reaction <lb/> ν  e  + d → p + p + e <lb/> −  as a function of the energy of the <lb/>outgoing electron. For these reactions, thresholds are sit-<lb/>uated at considerably smaller energy values than for <lb/> 16  O <lb/>and the cross-section peaks at smaller energies, typically <lb/>around the maximum of the neutrino distribution. As a <lb/>consequence, supernova spectra with lower average ener-<lb/>gies require smaller gamma components in the synthetic <lb/>spectrum to obtain a good agreement. This is shown in the <lb/>figure. For fits including beta-beam spectra only down to <lb/> γ = 5, folded cross-sections at low average energies tend <lb/>to be overestimated. Including spectra at lower gamma <lb/>increases the agreement [30]. The introduction of a weight <lb/>function in the fitting procedure can assure that the fit <lb/>is optimal in the energy region dominating the nuclear <lb/>response [30]. <lb/> 4 Conclusion <lb/> Low-energy beta beams are efficient tools to learn about <lb/>the response of a neutrino detector to supernova neutri-<lb/>nos. Taking linear combinations of the detector response <lb/>to beta-beam spectra provides a very accurate picture of <lb/>the supernova neutrino signal in a terrestrial detector. <lb/>This technique would work for almost any target nucleus. <lb/>We have demonstrated theoretically its potential for deu-<lb/>terium and oxygen which are the nuclei relevant for SNO <lb/>and for SuperKamiokande. <lb/> The authors would like to thank C.

			<body> EPJ A direct <lb/> electronic only <lb/> Neutrino-nucleon scattering rates in protoneutron stars and <lb/>nuclear correlations in the spin S = 1 channel <lb/> L. Mornas <lb/> a <lb/> Departamento de Física, Universidad de Oviedo, Avda Calvo Sotelo 18, 33007 Oviedo, Spain <lb/>Received: 20 June 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 27 February 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. The neutrino-nucleon cross-section is calculated in dense nuclear matter at finite temperature, <lb/>in view of applications to supernovae and protoneutron stars. The main contribution to this parameter is <lb/>provided by the axial response function. Nuclear correlations play an important role: while the ν-N cross-<lb/>section is usually reduced by correlations, a collective mode in the spin S = 1 channel may be excited. In <lb/>that case, the cross-section diverges and the neutrino mean free path would be drastically reduced. The <lb/>predictions of various models of the nuclear force commonly used in the literature are compared in relation <lb/>with a possible spin instability. While Skyrme or Gogny forces lead to attraction in this channel, variational <lb/>or Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations predict a repulsive contribution. An interesting alternative appears <lb/>to be the density-dependent M3Y interaction. <lb/> PACS. 26.60.+c Nuclear matter aspects of neutron stars – 25.30.Pt Neutrino scattering – 21.60.Jz Hartree-<lb/>Fock and random-phase approximations <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> With the development of more sensitive neutrino detec-<lb/>tors, we would now be able to measure the neutrino burst <lb/>produced in a supernova explosion with good statistics. <lb/>At the same time, more powerful computers make it pos-<lb/>sible to solve numerically the general relativistic collapse <lb/>together with neutrino transport described by the Boltz-<lb/>mann equations (see, e.g., [1]). The shape of the neutrino <lb/>burst could thus be predicted —even though this is still <lb/>obscured in the early stages by the problem of shock stall. <lb/>Of special interest is the tail of the signal, between 20 <lb/>and 50 seconds after beginning of the collapse. The outer <lb/>shells of the supernova should have then been expelled. <lb/>This corresponds to the deleptonization and first cooling <lb/>phase of the newly formed protoneutron star. The neutri-<lb/>nos, which were dynamically trapped in the interior by the <lb/>high density and temperature reached during the collapse, <lb/>are now gradually released out. During this phase, the <lb/>neutrino transport can be described by a diffusion equa-<lb/>tion [2]. The main ingredient of this description, the mean <lb/>free path, is affected by the state of the matter. Thus, the <lb/>observation of the tail of the neutrino burst could bring <lb/>some information on the properties of nuclear matter. <lb/> a  e-mail: lysiane@fisi24.ciencias.uniovi.es <lb/> 2 Neutrino-nucleon scattering rates <lb/> Since the purpose of this work is to investigate the re-<lb/>liability of the available descriptions of the nuclear in-<lb/>teractions rather than to make accurate predictions for <lb/>the neutrino mean free path, a number of simplifications <lb/>will be made: i) among all possible processes involving <lb/>neutrinos, only neutrino-nucleon scattering is considered; <lb/>ii) the interaction potential in the p-h channel will be <lb/>treated in the Landau-Fermi Liquid approximation. In <lb/>the non-relativistic approximation, the differential cross-<lb/>section for ν–N scattering is given as a function of the <lb/>energy of the scattered neutrino E <lb/> ν  and of the scattering <lb/>angle θ by <lb/>1 <lb/> V <lb/> dσ <lb/>dωdΩ <lb/>= <lb/> G <lb/> 2 <lb/> F <lb/> 8π  3  (E <lb/> ν  ) <lb/> 2  [1 − f (E <lb/> ν  )] <lb/> × <lb/> (1 + cos θ)S <lb/> (0)  + (3 − cos θ)S <lb/> (1) <lb/> . <lb/> In this limit, the spin-0 and spin-1 responses S <lb/> (0)  , <lb/> S <lb/> (1)  correspond to the vector and axial couplings, re-<lb/>spectively.

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> The main contribution comes from the axial response <lb/>function, for which reason the neutrino-nucleon mean free <lb/>path will be specially sensitive to the properties of the <lb/>nuclear interaction in the spin S = 1 channel. <lb/> 2.1 Medium effects <lb/> It has long been known (see, e.g., [3]) that the neutrino-<lb/>nucleon cross-section is affected by the fact that the nucle-<lb/>ons with which it is interacting are not free, but strongly <lb/>correlated. The medium effects are of various types. A <lb/>straightforward correction is to treat the nucleons in the <lb/>mean-field approximation, where they acquire effective <lb/>masses, momenta and chemical potentials due to their <lb/>interactions with the other nucleons surrounding them. <lb/>If one goes further to the random phase approximation <lb/>(RPA), we are taking into account the screening of the nu-<lb/>clear interaction by particle-hole production. Usually, the <lb/>RPA correlations are found to reduce the cross-section. <lb/>If, however, a collective mode is excited, there is a siz-<lb/>able enhancement. For Skyrme parametrizations of the <lb/>nuclear interaction, for example, a spin instability —which <lb/>is identified in pure neutron matter with the onset of <lb/>ferromagnetism— appears at high density. In this case, <lb/>a pole is present in the cross-section and the mean free <lb/>path consequently goes to zero [4,5,6,7]. Another effect, <lb/>the broadening of the width of the nucleon, which is im-<lb/>portant for the Bremsstrahlung and modified URCA pro-<lb/>cesses, will not be treated in this contribution. <lb/>The vector and axial structure functions are propor-<lb/>tional to the imaginary part of the corresponding polar-<lb/>izations. In the random phase approximation, the polar-<lb/>izations obey Dyson equations: <lb/> Π <lb/> RPA <lb/> V /A  = Π  0  + Π <lb/> RPA <lb/> V /A  V  (S=0/1)  Π  0  . <lb/> In asymmetric np matter in β equilibrium, these equa-<lb/>tions have a 2 × 2 matrix structure, e.g., <lb/> Π  0  = <lb/> Π <lb/> 0 <lb/> n  0 <lb/>0 Π <lb/> 0 <lb/> p <lb/> (Linhardt function). <lb/>The interaction potential in the p-h channel in the <lb/>Landau-Fermi Liquid approximation is <lb/> V  (S=0)  = <lb/> f  nn  f  np <lb/> f  pn  f  pp <lb/> , <lb/>V  (S=1)  = <lb/> g  nn  g  np <lb/> g  pn  g  pp <lb/> . <lb/> The Landau parameters f  ij  , g  ij  describe the interaction <lb/>between particles having momenta close to the Fermi mo-<lb/>mentum. They can be obtained, e.g., from the second func-<lb/>tional derivative of the polarized energy functional with <lb/>respect to the density (or from the first derivative of the <lb/>single-particle potential). In order to keep things as simple <lb/>as possible we will work in the monopolar approximation <lb/> l = 0 (no angular or momentum dependence). In this case, <lb/>the Landau parameters are real functions of the partial <lb/>densities of neutrons and protons. <lb/> 2.2 Spin (in-)stability <lb/> The criterion for a spin instability to occur is when the <lb/>determinant of the inverse magnetic susceptibility matrix <lb/>(χ  ij  , where i, j ∈ {n, p}) vanishes. In terms of the Landau <lb/>parameters: <lb/>Det <lb/> 1 <lb/> χ  ij <lb/> = 0 ↔ Det <lb/> (1 + G <lb/> nn <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> G <lb/> np <lb/> 0 <lb/> G <lb/> pn <lb/> 0 <lb/> (1 + G <lb/> pp <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> = 0 , <lb/> where G <lb/> ij <lb/> 0  = <lb/> N  i <lb/> 0  N <lb/> j <lb/> 0  g <lb/> ij <lb/> 0  and N <lb/> i <lb/> 0  = m <lb/>  * <lb/> i  k  F i  /π <lb/> 2  . <lb/>On the other hand, when solving the RPA equations, <lb/>we obtain, e.g., <lb/> Π <lb/> RPA <lb/> A nn  = <lb/>(1 − g  pp  Π <lb/> 0 <lb/> p  )Π <lb/> 0 <lb/> n <lb/> Det[I − V  (S=1)  Π  0  ] <lb/> . <lb/> In the limit where the temperature T and the energy <lb/>transfer ω go to zero we find <lb/> Re Π <lb/> i <lb/> 0  (ω, k) → −N <lb/> i <lb/> 0 <lb/> ⇒ D  A  = Det[I − V  (S=1)  Π  0  ] = 0. <lb/>A spin instability, therefore, gives rise to a peak in <lb/>the structure function and in the neutrino cross-section. <lb/>Such a spin instability has been observed to appear in non-<lb/>relativistic (e.g. Skyrme) [8] as well as in relativistic (σωρ) <lb/>models [9] of the nuclear interaction. It has been argued <lb/>that it could be related to the exchange (Fock) part of <lb/>the interaction. On the other hand, such an instability is <lb/>not seen in recent non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock <lb/>calculations. <lb/> 3 The effective nuclear interaction in the spin <lb/>channel <lb/> In order to investigate this point more closely, we have <lb/>tried a large variety of modelizations of the nuclear in-<lb/>teraction commonly used to describe, on the one hand <lb/>the properties of nuclei and of heavy-ion collisions, on the <lb/>other hand the properties of neutron stars. Ideally, a sin-<lb/>gle model should be able to accommodate all these facts <lb/>before we can risk to perform extrapolations and make <lb/>predictions in less accessible situations such as those en-<lb/>countered in protoneutron stars. Among the interactions <lb/>probed were: <lb/> – The Skyrme interaction <lb/> V (r) = t  0  (1 + x  0  P  σ  )δ(r) <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> t  1  (1 + x  1  P  σ  ) <lb/> k <lb/> 2  δ(r) + δ(r) k <lb/> 2 <lb/> + t  2  (1 + x  2  P  σ  )k <lb/>  δ(r) k + <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/> t  3  (1 + x  3  P  σ  ) ρ <lb/> α <lb/>N  δ(r). <lb/> The Skyrme interaction leads to a good description of <lb/>properties of nuclei, nuclear matter and neutron stars. <lb/>Recent parametrizations adapted to non-symmetric nu-<lb/>clear matter have been developed in the context of neutron <lb/>stars, like the Skyrme-Lyon series [10] which was adjusted <lb/>to reproduce microscopical neutron matter calculations. <lb/>All Skyrme interactions (except the rather old and inac-<lb/>curate SV parametrization [11]) lead to spin instabilities. <lb/> L. Mornas: Neutrino scattering rates in protoneutron stars and nuclear correlations in the spin-1 channel <lb/>51 <lb/> – The Gogny interaction <lb/> It has been argued that the reason for this behavior of the <lb/>Skyrme interaction could be that it is written only as a <lb/>combination of contact interactions. On the other hand, <lb/>the Gogny interaction consists of a finite range part, to <lb/>which a Skyrme-like contact term is added to describe <lb/>correlations: <lb/> V (r) = <lb/> i=1,2 <lb/> t <lb/> W <lb/>i  + t <lb/> B <lb/>i  P  σ  − t <lb/> H <lb/>i  P  τ  − t <lb/> M <lb/>i  P  σ  P  τ <lb/> exp −(r/a  i  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> + <lb/> i=1,2 <lb/> t  3i  (1 + x  3i  P  σ  )ρ <lb/> αi  δ(r). <lb/> The Gogny interaction yields a good description of the <lb/>properties of nuclei and nuclear matter. Note that the <lb/>original set D1S is not suitable for neutron matter, which <lb/>would be found to be unstable and collapse. An improved <lb/>parametrization D1P has been developed by Farine et <lb/> al. [12]: it is adjusted to reproduce microscopical neu-<lb/>tron matter calculations. It is indeed found [6] that the <lb/>spin instability, which in the Skyrme models was found <lb/>to occur around 1.5–3 times the saturation density n  sat <lb/> (for some models, even below n  sat  !) is delayed in the D1P <lb/>Gogny model to high densities, where other phenomena, <lb/>like hyperon production and the transition to quark gluon <lb/>plasma, are expected to occur anyway. <lb/> – The Modified Seyler-Blanchard interaction <lb/> In order to see whether the finite-range character of the <lb/>interaction is the key to the suppression of spin insta-<lb/>bility, we next introduced several versions of the Modi-<lb/>fied Seyler-Blanchard interaction (MSB). This interaction, <lb/>originally introduced by Myers and Swiatecki [13], con-<lb/>sists of a finite-range (Yukawa) term and is momentum <lb/>and density dependent: <lb/> V = −C  ul <lb/> 1 − <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> b  2  − d <lb/> 2  (ρ  1  + ρ  2  ) <lb/> n <lb/> e <lb/> −r/a <lb/> r/a <lb/> with parameters C  ul  for {n ↑, n ↓, p ↑, p ↓} It yields a <lb/>good description of the properties of nuclei, nuclear matter <lb/>and neutron stars. It leads to spin instabilities at about <lb/>twice the saturation density, and indeed has been used <lb/>to describe the consequences of having polarized nuclear <lb/>matter in the context of neutron stars [14].

On the one hand, we have <lb/>the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculation of polarized nu-<lb/>clear matter performed by Vidaña and Bombaci [18] and <lb/>the extraction of Landau parameters in pure neutron mat-<lb/>ter with application to the neutrino-nucleon cross-section <lb/>published by Margueron et al. [19] (denoted here by the <lb/>label &quot; MVB &quot; ). A similar work was done by Zuo et al. <lb/> and Shen et al. [20] in symmetric nuclear matter (denoted <lb/>here by the label &quot; ZLS &quot; ). On the other hand, we used <lb/>a parametrization of variational calculations by Akmal, <lb/>Pandharipande and Ravenhall [21] for spin saturated sys-<lb/>tems, supplemented by an extension by Cowell and Pand-<lb/>haripande [22] for spin-polarized systems (denoted here by <lb/>the label &quot; APR + CP &quot; ).

Criterion for ferromagnetic instability in neutron star <lb/>matter (labels: see text). <lb/> can be derived from the observation of the Gamow-Teller <lb/>resonance in the spin-isospin channel. Zuo et al. [20] quote <lb/>a value G <lb/> 0  1.18 referring to a work by Suzuki [23] (indi-<lb/>cated by a star in fig. 2). In an older work by Bäckman et <lb/>al., [24] a higher value G <lb/> 0  1.6–1.7 is quoted. In the <lb/>spin channel, the absence of a clear resonance sets a <lb/>constraint on the value of G  0  , namely it is compatible <lb/>with zero within some error bars. From [24] we will take <lb/> G  0  = 0.1 ± 0.1 (indicated by a double arrow in fig. 1). <lb/> – In the spin-isospin channel ( &quot; Gamow Teller &quot; ) <lb/> The microscopical calculations (Brueckner-Hartree-Fock <lb/>from ZLS and variational from APR + CP) reproduce the <lb/>experimental value at saturation density determined from <lb/>observation of the Gamow-Teller giant resonance. They <lb/>coincide for n  B  &lt; n  sat  but differ strongly at high density. <lb/>The M3Y interactions are also compatible with the experi-<lb/>mental value at saturation density. On the other hand, the <lb/>Skyrme interactions do not generally reproduce the quoted <lb/>value for G <lb/> 0  . An exception should be made for the SGII <lb/>parametrization [25] of the Skyrme force, which was spe-<lb/>cially adjusted to reproduce the Gamow-Teller resonance. <lb/>The value of G <lb/> 0  obtained for this model is nevertheless <lb/>rather low. A further discussion of the adequacy of the <lb/>Skyrme force to describe the spin-isospin modes can be <lb/>found in Bender et al. [26]. <lb/> – In the spin channel ( &quot; Fermi &quot; ) <lb/> The parametrization of variational results APR + CP also <lb/>reproduces the recommended value G  0  = 0.1 ± 0.1. The <lb/>Landau parameters extracted from BHF calculations in <lb/>contrast obtain too high values. The Skyrme results are <lb/>in general too high at saturation density, except, again, <lb/>the SGII parametrization. The MSB result is compatible <lb/>with the available data. Finally, the M3Y models are again <lb/>compatible with the experimental constraint. <lb/> – Pure neutron matter <lb/> In pure neutron matter there is only one relevant Landau <lb/>parameter, G <lb/> nn <lb/> 0  , which is displayed in fig. 3. Its behavior <lb/>is not very different from that of G <lb/> 0  in symmetric nuclear <lb/>matter. Let us note that the SGII parametrization leads <lb/>to an instability at a low value of the density ∼ 1.6 n  sat <lb/> in pure neutron matter. <lb/> – Neutron star matter in β equilibrium <lb/> In neutron star matter in β equilibrium there are three dif-<lb/>ferent Landau parameters, G <lb/> nn <lb/> 0  , G <lb/> pp <lb/> 0  and G <lb/> np <lb/> 0  . They can <lb/>be combined to form the criterion for spin instability as ex-<lb/>plained in sect. 2.2. A sample of the results is displayed in <lb/>fig. 4. We can see that the Skyrme parametrizations indeed <lb/>lead to an instability at low density. In particular, this is <lb/>also the case of the SGII parametrization: even though it <lb/>was adjusted to give optimal results in symmetric nuclear <lb/>matter, the stability criterion is here dominated by the <lb/>interaction between neutrons.

This includes microscopical <lb/>calculations (variational or Brueckner), the M3Y models <lb/>as well as the Gogny parametrization at low density. In <lb/>these figures, we have represented the contribution of the <lb/>neutrons to the response function for the APR + CP [21, <lb/>22] (fig. 5) and M3YP1 [16] (fig. 6) parametrizations <lb/>at saturation density, for neutrino-free matter in β <lb/> equilibrium, at a temperature T = 10 MeV and for a mo-<lb/>mentum transfer k = 10 MeV.

Also <lb/>represented are the vector S  V  (dashed line) and axial S  A <lb/> (dash-dotted line) response functions in the random phase <lb/>approximation.

This is the case of the Skyrme <lb/>or MSB interactions as well as of the Gogny interaction <lb/>at high density. The model chosen for fig. 7 is the SkI3 <lb/>Skyrme parametrization, which fulfills the criterion for <lb/>spin instability for a density ∼ 3.1 n  sat  , whereas the spin <lb/>responses are plotted, as in figs. 5-6, at saturation density: <lb/>even though we are still far from the transition, a precur-<lb/>sor of the pole is already to be seen as an enhancement <lb/>in the axial response function at zero energy ω = 0.

It will be important to investigate the <lb/>role of tensor force [27] (which was not taken into account <lb/>here) in relation with the consequences of this transition <lb/>on the neutrino mean free path. <lb/>The density-dependent Michigan three range models <lb/>also predict a reduction of the cross-section from RPA cor-<lb/>rections, but by a smaller factor (up to 40%). Very similar <lb/>results are obtained for 8 different parametrizations of the <lb/>M3Y forces. More detailed results for the M3Y forces will <lb/>be published in [17]. <lb/> 7 Conclusion and outlook <lb/> The object of this contribution has been to investigate <lb/>whether our knowledge of the nuclear interaction in the <lb/>spin S = 1 is established on a sufficiently firm basis to <lb/>allow to make predictions for the neutrino-nucleon cross-<lb/>section in protoneutron star matter, and eventually to pre-<lb/>dict the shape of the neutrino burst. The answer is, un-<lb/>fortunately, not positive at the present time. This should <lb/>not in fact come as a surprise. The interaction, which we <lb/>have characterized here in terms of the Landau parame-<lb/>ters, is immediately translatable in terms of &quot; spin asym-<lb/>metry &quot;  E  s  and &quot; spin-isospin asymmetry &quot;  E  st  energies. A <lb/>similar uncertainty as to the behavior of the asymmetry <lb/>energy E  t  (or, equivalently, of the Landau parameter F <lb/> 0  ) <lb/>as a function of density has long been the subject of in-<lb/>tense research. Experiments involving neutron-rich nuclei <lb/>or neutrino-nucleon scattering, in parallel with renewed <lb/>efforts of groups who perform Brueckner as well as vari-<lb/>ational many-body calculations in the spin sector, will <lb/>hopefully help reduce this uncertainty. In the meantime, <lb/>some care has to be exerted when choosing an interaction <lb/>to describe the neutrino-nucleon cross-section. <lb/>While the microscopical calculations are —up to a cer-<lb/>tain point— parameter free and more satisfactory from a <lb/>conceptual point of view, their use is hampered by the <lb/>heavy numerical work involved, so that a parametriza-<lb/>tion seems necessary. On the other hand, we have seen <lb/>that the phenomenological interactions are not well under <lb/>control. One could of course extract the Landau parame-<lb/>ters from the microscopical calculations and parametrize <lb/>them. The M3Y interactions can be a valuable alterna-<lb/>tive, since they have the interesting properties of repro-<lb/>ducing without special adjustments the spin Landau pa-<lb/>rameters at saturation, and of being free of spin instabili-<lb/>ties. Moreover, the 3-range Yukawa structure allow a more <lb/>transparent connection to the meson-exchange models of <lb/>the nucleon-nucleon potential: there have indeed been at-<lb/>tempts to parametrize Brueckner calculations in terms of <lb/>M3Y interactions [28]. <lb/> This work was supported by the Spanish-European (FI-<lb/>CYT/FEDER) grant No. PB02-076. <lb/></body>

Some of the many possible corollary model-dependent quests for <lb/>the candidate particle have also been investigated. At present, the second-generation DAMA/LIBRA setup <lb/>( 250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl)) is in operation deep underground.

Several low background setups have been realized; <lb/>the main ones are: i) DAMA/NaI ( 100 kg of highly <lb/>radiopure NaI(Tl)), which took data underground over <lb/>seven annual cycles and was put out of operation in July <lb/>2002 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]; ii) DAMA/LXe <lb/>( 6.5 kg liquid xenon) [15]; iii) DAMA/R&amp;D, which is <lb/>devoted to tests on prototypes and small-scale experi-<lb/>ments [16]; iv) the new second-generation DAMA/LIBRA <lb/>setup ( 250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl)) in operation <lb/>since March 2003. Moreover, in the framework of devoted <lb/>R&amp;D for radiopure detectors and photomultipliers, sam-<lb/>ple measurements are regularly carried out by means of <lb/>the low background DAMA/Ge detector, installed deep <lb/>underground for more than 10 years and, in some cases, <lb/>by means of Ispra facilities. <lb/>In the following, we will focus our attention only on <lb/>the DAMA/NaI results, mainly recalling the investigation <lb/>of the annual modulation signature due to a Dark Matter <lb/>(DM) particle component in the galactic halo. At present, <lb/>apart DAMA/LIBRA, no other experiment is sensitive, <lb/> a  e-mail: Francesco.Nozzoli@roma2.infn.it <lb/> for mass and stability, to such a signature. The model-<lb/>independent annual modulation signature (originally sug-<lb/>gested in [17]) is very distinctive since it requires the si-<lb/>multaneous satisfaction of all the following requirements: <lb/>the rate must contain a component modulated accord-<lb/>ing to a cosine function (1) with one year period, T (2) <lb/>and a phase, t  0  , that peaks around  2nd June (3); this <lb/>modulation must only be found in a well-defined low-<lb/>energy range, where the Dark Matter particle can induce <lb/>signals (4); it must apply to those events in which just <lb/>one detector of many actually &quot; fires &quot; (single-hit events), <lb/>since the DM particle multi-scattering probability is negli-<lb/>gible (5); the modulation amplitude in the region of maxi-<lb/>mal sensitivity is expected to be ∼ 7% for usually adopted <lb/>dark halo distributions (6), but it can be larger in case of <lb/>some possible scenarios such as, e.g., those in refs. [18, <lb/>19]. To mimic such a signature spurious effects or side re-<lb/>actions should be able both to account for the whole ob-<lb/>served modulation amplitude and to contemporaneously <lb/>satisfy all the requirements; none has been found [2,3]. <lb/>Some of the main topics related to this argument on <lb/>the DAMA/NaI results are shortly summarized in the <lb/>following; for a detailed discussion see refs. [2,3] and <lb/>references therein. For a description of the setup and its <lb/>performances see refs. [1,2,3,10]. <lb/></body>

The superimposed curve represents the cosinusoidal <lb/>function behaviour expected for a Dark Matter particle signal with a period equal to 1 y and phase exactly on 2nd June; the <lb/>modulation amplitude has been obtained by best fit. On the right: experimental residual rates over seven annual cycles for <lb/> single-hit events (open circles) —class of events to which Dark Matter particle events belong— and over the last two annual <lb/>cycles for multiple-hits events (filled triangles) —class of events to which Dark Matter particle events do not belong— in the <lb/>(2–6) keV cumulative energy interval. They have been obtained by considering for each class of events the data as collected in a <lb/>single annual cycle and using in both cases the same identical hardware and the same identical software procedures. The initial <lb/>time is taken on August 7th [2, 3]. <lb/> 2 The model-independent result of <lb/>DAMA/NaI <lb/> A model-independent approach on the data collected by <lb/>DAMA/NaI over seven annual cycles offers an immedi-<lb/>ate evidence of the presence of an annual modulation of <lb/>the measured rate of the single-hit events in the lowest-<lb/>energy region. In particular, in fig. 1, left, the time be-<lb/>haviour of the residual rate of the single-hit events in the <lb/>cumulative (2–6) keV energy interval is reported. The data <lb/>favour the presence of a modulated cosine-like behaviour <lb/>(A · cos ω(t − t  0  )) at 6.3σ C.L. and their fit for this cumu-<lb/>lative energy interval offers modulation amplitude equal <lb/>to (0.0200 ± 0.0032) cpd/kg/keV, t  0  = (140 ± 22) d and <lb/> T = <lb/> 2π <lb/> ω  = (1.00 ± 0.01) y, all parameters kept free in the <lb/>fit. The period and phase agree with those expected in <lb/>the case of an effect induced by Dark Matter particles in <lb/>the galactic halo (T = 1 y and t  0  roughly at  152.5th <lb/>day of the year). The χ <lb/> 2  test on the (2–6) keV residual <lb/>rate disfavours the hypothesis of unmodulated behaviour <lb/>giving a probability of 7 · 10 <lb/> −4  (χ <lb/> 2  /d.o.f. = 71/37). The <lb/>same data have also been investigated by a Fourier anal-<lb/>ysis: a clear peak corresponding to a period of  1 y is <lb/>present [2,3]. Modulation is not observed above 6 keV <lb/> 1  . <lb/>Finally, a suitable statistical analysis has shown that the <lb/>modulation amplitudes are statistically well distributed in <lb/>all the crystals, in all the data taking periods and consid-<lb/>ered energy bins. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 1  We recall that DAMA/NaI took data up to the MeV energy <lb/>region despite the optimization was done for the keV energy <lb/>range. <lb/></note>

			<body> As a further relevant investigation, the multiple-hits <lb/> events collected during the DAMA/NaI-6 and 7 running <lb/>periods (when each detector was equipped with its own <lb/>Transient Digitizer with a dedicated renewed electron-<lb/>ics) have been studied and analysed by using the same <lb/>identical hardware and the same identical software proce-<lb/>dures as for the case of the single-hit events (see fig. 1, <lb/>right). The multiple-hits event class —on the contrary <lb/>of the single-hit one— does not include events induced <lb/>by Dark Matter particles since the probability that a <lb/>Dark Matter particle interacts in more than one detec-<lb/>tor is negligible. The obtained modulation amplitudes are: <lb/> A = (0.0195 ± 0.0031) cpd/kg/keV and A = −(3.9 ± 7.9) · <lb/> 10 <lb/> −4  cpd/kg/keV for single-hit and multiple-hits residual <lb/>rates, respectively. Thus, evidence of annual modulation <lb/>is present in the single-hit residuals (event class to which <lb/>the Dark Matter particle induced events belong), while <lb/>it is absent in the multiple-hits residual rate (event class <lb/>to which only background events belong). Since the same <lb/>identical hardware and the same identical software pro-<lb/>cedures have been used for the two classes of events, the <lb/>obtained result offers an additional strong support for the <lb/>presence of Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo fur-<lb/>ther excluding any side effect either from hardware or from <lb/>software procedures or from background. <lb/>Moreover, a careful investigation of all the known pos-<lb/>sible sources of systematics and side reactions has been <lb/>regularly carried out and published at time of each data re-<lb/>lease and quantitative discussions can be found in refs. [2, <lb/>3,10]. No systematic effect or side reaction able to account <lb/>for the observed modulation amplitude and to satisfy all <lb/>the requirements of the signature has been found.

Summary of the results obtained by investigating <lb/>the possible sources of systematics or of side reactions [2, 3]. <lb/>No systematics or side reaction has been found able to give a <lb/>modulation amplitude different from zero; thus very cautious <lb/>upper limits (90% C.L.) have been calculated and are shown <lb/>here in terms of the measured model-independent modulation <lb/>amplitude, S <lb/> obs <lb/> m  . As can be seen, they cannot account for the <lb/>measured modulation amplitude and, in addition, cannot sat-<lb/>isfy the peculiar requirements of the signature. <lb/>Source <lb/>Cautious upper limit <lb/>(90%C.L.) <lb/>Radon <lb/> &lt; 0.2%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Temperature <lb/> &lt; 0.5%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Noise <lb/> &lt; 1%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Energy scale <lb/> &lt; 1%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Efficiencies <lb/> &lt; 1%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Background <lb/> &lt; 0.5%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> Side reactions <lb/> &lt; 0.3%S <lb/> obs <lb/>m <lb/> In addition: no effect can mimic the signature <lb/> tributions to the modulated amplitude have been calcu-<lb/>lated as summarized in table 1; for detailed and quantita-<lb/>tive discussions see refs. [2,3,10]. <lb/>In conclusion, the presence of an annual modulation <lb/>in the residual rate of the single-hit events in the lowest-<lb/>energy interval (2–6) keV, satisfying all the features ex-<lb/>pected for a Dark Matter particle component in the galac-<lb/>tic halo is supported by the data of the seven annual cy-<lb/>cles at 6.3σ C.L. No systematic effect or side reaction able <lb/>to account for the observed effect has been found. This <lb/>is the experimental result of DAMA/NaI; it is model-<lb/>independent. No other experiment, whose result can be <lb/>directly compared with this one in a model-independent <lb/>way, is available so far in the field of Dark Matter investi-<lb/>gation. <lb/> 3 Some corollary model-dependent quests for <lb/>a candidate <lb/> On the basis of the obtained 6.3σ model-independent <lb/>result, corollary investigations can also be pursued on <lb/>the nature of the Dark Matter particle candidate. <lb/>This latter investigation is instead model-dependent and <lb/>—considering the large uncertainties which exist on the <lb/>astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics assumptions <lb/>and on the parameters needed in the calculations— has <lb/>no general meaning (as is also the case of exclusion plots <lb/>and of the Dark Matter particle parameters evaluated in <lb/>indirect detection experiments). Thus, it should be han-<lb/>dled in the most general way as we have pointed out with <lb/>time passing [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,2,3]. <lb/>Candidates, kinds of Dark Matter particle couplings <lb/>with ordinary matter and implications, cross-sections, nu-<lb/>clear form factors, spin factors, scaling laws, halo models, <lb/>etc., are discussed to some extent in refs.

Values of ξσ  SI  lower than those corresponding <lb/>to this allowed region are possible also, e.g., in case of an even small Spin-Dependent contribution.

Values of ξσSD lower than those corresponding to this allowed region are possible also, e.g., in case of an even <lb/>smaller Spin-Independent contribution. <lb/> For simplicity, here the results of these corollary quests <lb/>for a candidate particle are presented in terms of allowed <lb/>volumes/regions obtained as superposition of the configu-<lb/>rations corresponding to likelihood function values distant <lb/> more than 4σ from the null hypothesis (absence of mod-<lb/>ulation) in each of the possible model frameworks con-<lb/>sidered in refs. [2,3]. These allowed regions take into ac-<lb/>count the time and energy behaviours of the single-hit ex-<lb/>perimental data and have been obtained by a maximum-<lb/>likelihood procedure which requires the agreement i) of the <lb/>expectations for the modulated part of the signal with the <lb/>measured modulated behaviour for each detector and for <lb/>each energy bin; ii) of the expectations for the unmodu-<lb/>lated component of the signal with the respect to the mea-<lb/>sured differential energy distribution and —since ref. [9] <lb/>— also with the bound on recoils obtained by pulse shape <lb/>discrimination from the devoted DAMA/NaI-0 data [4]. <lb/>The latter one acts in the likelihood procedure as an ex-<lb/>perimental upper bound on the unmodulated component <lb/>of the signal and —as a matter of fact— as an experi-<lb/>mental lower bound on the estimate of the background <lb/>levels. Thus, the C.L.&apos;s, which we quote for the allowed <lb/>volumes/regions, already account for compatibility with <lb/>the measured differential energy spectrum and with the <lb/>measured upper bound on recoils. Finally, it is worth not-<lb/>ing that the best-fit values of cross-sections and Dark Mat-<lb/>ter particle mass span over a large range when varying the <lb/>considered model framework. <lb/>Figures 2–4 show some of the obtained allowed <lb/>slices/regions [2,3].

Moreover, re-<lb/>cently, it has been suggested [24] that these positive hints <lb/>and the effect observed by DAMA/NaI can also be de-<lb/>scribed in a scenario with multi-component Dark Matter <lb/>in the galactic halo, made of a subdominant component of <lb/>heavy neutrinos of the 4th family and of a sterile dominant <lb/>component [24]. <lb/> 4 Towards the future: from DAMA/NaI to <lb/>DAMA/LIBRA and beyond <lb/> The large merits of highly radiopure NaI(Tl) setup have <lb/>been demonstrated in the practice by DAMA/NaI which <lb/>has been the most radiopure setup available in this partic-<lb/>ular field. It has effectively pursued a model-independent <lb/>approach to investigate Dark Matter particles in the galac-<lb/>tic halo collecting an exposure several orders of magnitude <lb/>larger than those available in the field and has obtained <lb/>many other complementary or by-products results. <lb/>In 1996 DAMA proposed to realize a ton setup [25] and <lb/>a new R&amp;D project for highly radiopure NaI(Tl) detectors <lb/>was funded at that time and carried out for several years <lb/>in order to realize as an intermediate step the second-<lb/>generation experiment, successor of DAMA/NaI, with an <lb/>exposed mass of about 250 kg. <lb/> Fig. 6. The installation of the 25 NaI(Tl) crystals (9.70 kg <lb/>each) of DAMA/LIBRA in high-purity nitrogen atmosphere. <lb/>All the procedures as well as the photos have been carried out <lb/>in high-purity nitrogen atmosphere. <lb/> Thus, new powders and other materials have been se-<lb/>lected, new chemical/physical radiopurification procedu-<lb/>res in NaI and TlI powders have been exploited, new grow-<lb/>ing/handling protocols have been developed and new pro-<lb/>totypes have been built and tested. As a consequence of <lb/>the results of this second-generation R&amp;D, the new exper-<lb/>imental setup DAMA/LIBRA (Large sodium Iodide Bulk <lb/>for RAre processes),  250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl) <lb/>crystal scintillators (matrix of twenty-five  9.70 kg <lb/>NaI(Tl) crystals), was funded at the end of 1999 and re-<lb/>alised. In fact, after the completion of the DAMA/NaI <lb/>data taking in July 2002, the dismounting of DAMA/NaI <lb/>occurred and the installation of DAMA/LIBRA started. <lb/>The experimental site as well as many components of the <lb/>installation itself have been implemented (environment, <lb/>shield of the photomultipliers, wiring, high-purity nitrogen <lb/>system, cooling water of air conditioner, electronics and <lb/>data acquisition system, etc.). In particular, all the cop-<lb/>per parts have been chemically etched before their instal-<lb/>lation following a new devoted protocol and maintained <lb/>in high-purity nitrogen atmosphere until the installation. <lb/>All the procedures performed during the dismounting of <lb/>DAMA/NaI and the installation of DAMA/LIBRA detec-<lb/>tors have been carried out in high-purity nitrogen atmo-<lb/>sphere (see fig. 6). <lb/>DAMA/LIBRA has taken data since March 2003 and <lb/>the first data release will, most probably, occur when an <lb/>exposure larger than that of DAMA/NaI will have been <lb/>collected and analysed in all the aspects. The highly ra-<lb/>diopure DAMA/LIBRA setup is a powerful tool for fur-<lb/>ther investigation on the Dark Matter particle component <lb/>in the galactic halo having many intrinsic merits [1,2,3, <lb/>4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14] and a larger exposed mass, <lb/>an higher overall radiopurity and improved performances <lb/>with the respect to DAMA/NaI. Thus, DAMA/LIBRA <lb/>will further investigate the 6.3σ C.L. model-independent <lb/>evidence pointed out by DAMA/NaI with increased sen-<lb/>sitivity in order to reach even higher C.L. Moreover, it <lb/></body>

			<body> will also offer an increased sensitivity to improve corol-<lb/>lary quests on the nature of the candidate particle, trying <lb/>to disentangle at least some of the many different possible <lb/>astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics models as well <lb/>as to investigate other new possible scenarios. As an ex-<lb/>ample, we remind the effects induced on the Dark Matter <lb/>particles distribution by the contributions from satellite <lb/>galaxies tidal streams, by the possible existence of caus-<lb/>tics and by the possible existence of &quot; solar wakes &quot; [26]. In <lb/>particular, recently it has been pointed out [19] that con-<lb/>tributions to the Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo <lb/>should be expected from tidal streams from the Sagittarius <lb/>Dwarf elliptical galaxy. Considering that this galaxy was <lb/>undiscovered until 1994 and considering galaxy formation <lb/>theories, one has to expect that also other satellite galax-<lb/>ies do exist and contribute as well. In particular, the Canis <lb/>Major satellite Galaxy has been pointed out as reported in <lb/>2003 in ref. [27]; it can, in principle, play a very significant <lb/>role being close to our galactic plane. At present, the best <lb/>way to investigate the presence of a stream contribution <lb/>is to determine more accurately the phase of the annual <lb/>modulation, t  0  , as a function of the energy; in fact, for a <lb/>given halo model, t  0  would be expected to be (slightly) <lb/>different from  152.5 d and to vary with energy. <lb/>Moreover, other interesting topics will be addressed by <lb/>the highly radiopure DAMA/LIBRA, such as the study <lb/>i) on the velocity and spatial distribution of the Dark <lb/>Matter particles in the galactic halo [2,13]; ii) on possible <lb/>structures as clumpiness with small scale size; iii) on the <lb/>couplings of the Dark Matter particle with the <lb/> 23  Na and <lb/> 127  I target nuclei; iv) on the nature of the Dark Matter <lb/>particles; v) on scaling laws and cross-sections (recently, it <lb/>has been pointed out [20] that, even for the neutralino can-<lb/>didate, the usually adopted scaling laws could not hold); <lb/>etc. A large work will be faced by DAMA/LIBRA, which <lb/>will also further investigate with higher sensitivity several <lb/>other rare processes. <lb/>Finally, at present a third-generation R&amp;D effort to-<lb/>wards a possible NaI(Tl) ton setup has been funded and <lb/>related works have already been started. <lb/> 5 Conclusion <lb/> DAMA/NaI has been a pioneer experiment investigating <lb/>as first the Dark Matter particle annual modulation sig-<lb/>nature with suitable sensitivity and control of the run-<lb/>ning parameters. During seven independent experiments <lb/>of one year each, it has pointed out at 6.3σ C.L. in a <lb/>model-independent way the presence of a modulation sat-<lb/>isfying the many peculiarities of an effect induced by Dark <lb/>Matter particles in the galactic halo; no systematic ef-<lb/>fect or side reaction able to account for the observed ef-<lb/>fect has been found. As a corollary result, it has also <lb/>pointed out the complexity of the quest for a candidate <lb/>particle mainly because of the present poor knowledge on <lb/>the many astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics re-<lb/>lated aspects. At present after a devoted R&amp;D effort, the <lb/>second-generation DAMA/LIBRA (a  250 kg more ra-<lb/>diopure NaI(Tl) setup) has been realised and put in op-<lb/>eration since March 2003 and a third-generation R&amp;D to-<lb/>ward a possible ton NaI(Tl) setup, which we proposed in <lb/>1996 [25], is also in progress. <lb/></body>

Wycech <lb/> The Andrzej Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies, 05-400 Otwock -´ <lb/>Swierk, Poland <lb/>Received: 11 July 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 14 March 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. The leading questions in today neutrino physics concern the transformation properties of neu-<lb/>trinos under charge conjugation, the lepton number conservation hypothesis and the values of neutrino <lb/>masses. The answers can be obtained if the neutrinoless double beta decay, 0ν2β, is observed and its rate <lb/>is measured. The mere observation of the process proves the Majorana nature of neutrinos as well as the <lb/>violation of the lepton number conservation, while the rate is a sensitive measure of the neutrino mass. <lb/>The search for this effect at present concerns mainly the double β <lb/> −  decay. This paper describes the recent <lb/>proposal to search for the neutrinoless radiative double electron capture as an attractive alternative to <lb/>the double β <lb/> −  decay. It is shown, moreover, that the same information which is expected from the 0ν2β <lb/>studies can in principle be also obtained from experiments using intense νe beams produced by radioactive <lb/>ions decaying in flight (the &quot; beta beams &quot; ). <lb/> PACS. 13.15.+g Neutrino interactions – 23.40.Bw Weak-interaction and lepton (including neutrino) as-<lb/>pects – 14.60.Pq Neutrino mass and mixing <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The discovery of lepton flavour mixing for neutrinos, <lb/>the so-called neutrino oscillations, has put the neutrino <lb/>physics in the lime-light of interest of particle, astro-parti-<lb/>cle and nuclear physics. Although the number of answered <lb/>questions is impressive, so is the shopping list of essential <lb/>queries. Thus we know that there are three and only three <lb/>kinds of weakly interacting neutrinos, we know that neu-<lb/>trinos are massive, we know the splittings between square <lb/>masses. This paper considers some possibilities of getting <lb/>answers to three of the remaining questions: the abso-<lb/>lute mass values, the lepton number conservation and the <lb/>neutrino-antineutrino identity. <lb/>The present limits on the mass values stem mainly <lb/>from three sources: the cosmologic one, giving the sum of <lb/>the three neutrino masses in a strongly model-dependent <lb/>way (see, e.g., [1]), the direct measurement [2] of the end <lb/>point of the <lb/> 3  H β <lb/> −  spectrum (m  νe  ≤ 2.2 eV) and the neu-<lb/>trinoless double β decay 0ν2β (m  νe  &lt; 0.3–1.0 eV, where <lb/>the range reflects the large nuclear matrix element uncer-<lb/>tainty [3,4]; a claim for having observed the effect cor-<lb/>responding to (0.2–0.6) eV neutrino mass value is made <lb/>in [5]; see [3] for comments). It should be emphasized that <lb/>the mere observation of this decay will provide unambigu-<lb/>ous answers to the next two questions: it will prove the <lb/> a  e-mail: sujkowsk@ipj.gov.pl <lb/> Majorana nature of neutrinos as well as the violation of <lb/>the lepton number conservation law. <lb/>After briefly reviewing the 0ν2β method in general we <lb/>shall concentrate on the recent suggestion of studying the <lb/>radiative neutrinoless double electron capture as an at-<lb/>tractive alternative to the double β <lb/> −  emission [6,7]. We <lb/>shall also outline the possible experiments with beta-beam <lb/>based neutrino factories. We shall show that the informa-<lb/>tion obtainable from such experiments is at least in prin-<lb/>ciple equivalent to that from the double beta decay. <lb/> 2 The neutrinoless double beta processes <lb/> The double beta decay processes are very slow. They are <lb/>observable only in cases for which the single β <lb/> ±  or EC <lb/>decays are energetically forbidden. We may distinguish the <lb/>following decays: <lb/> – β <lb/> −  β <lb/> −  : (Z, N ) → (Z + 2, N − 2) + β <lb/> −  + β <lb/> −  + ν  e  + ν  e  , <lb/> – β <lb/> +  β <lb/> +  : (Z, N ) → (Z − 2, N + 2) + β <lb/> +  + β <lb/> +  + ν  e  + ν  e  , <lb/> – β <lb/> +  EC : (Z, N ) → (Z − 2, N + 2) + β <lb/> +  + ν  e  + ν  e  , <lb/> – ECEC : (Z, N ) → (Z − 2, N + 2) + ν  e  + ν  e  . <lb/>If neutrino is a massive Majorana particle then the <lb/>first three processes can proceed without neutrino emis-<lb/>sion: the neutrino emitted in one weak interaction vertex <lb/>is absorbed in the other one and only the β <lb/> −  or β <lb/> +  elec-<lb/>trons are emitted. These carry out the total energy excess. <lb/>The double electron capture decay is not possible without <lb/></body>

This <lb/>is the radiative neutrinoless double electron capture, see <lb/>fig. 1, discussed in some details below. <lb/>The value to be determined in any of the 0ν2β pro-<lb/>cesses is the rate. This is a sensitive measure of the neu-<lb/>trino mass. To a good approximation the rate can be fac-<lb/>torized: <lb/> Γ = G(E, Z)M <lb/> 2  X <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where G(E, Z) is the phase space factor which can be <lb/>calculated rather accurately, M is the nuclear matrix el-<lb/>ement, not so easy to calculate, and X is proportional to <lb/>the effective neutrino rest mass. <lb/>For a detailed discussion of the 0ν2β processes, and <lb/>especially of the best studied 0νβ <lb/> −  β <lb/> −  one, we refer the <lb/>reader to recent reviews [3,4]. Below, we return to the ra-<lb/>diative neutrinoless double electron capture, 0νECECγ. <lb/>The process is possible due to the admixture of neutrinos <lb/>of opposite helicity. The amplitudes of these admixtures <lb/>are proportional to the neutrino rest mass. It should be <lb/>noted that because of the angular momentum conserva-<lb/>tion requirement the process precludes the capture of two <lb/>1S electrons. It is either the 1S + 2S electrons (the mag-<lb/>netic type transition) or the 1S +2P electrons (the electric <lb/>dipole transition). It is the second case which is of par-<lb/>ticular interest because of the possible atomic resonance <lb/>enhancement of the rate. <lb/>The theory of radiative single electron capture has <lb/>been given by Glauber and Martin in the fifties [8]. The <lb/>continuous photon spectra of this internal bremsstrahlung <lb/>process exhibit an interesting structure in the case of the <lb/>2P (or 3P ) electron capture: there is a singularity at the <lb/>photon energy equal to the 1S-2P or 1S-3P atomic level <lb/>energy difference. This prediction has been confirmed ex-<lb/>perimentally for several cases (cf., e.g., [9]). The same ap-<lb/>proach can be applied to the 0νECECγ case. Figure 2 <lb/>shows the Feynman diagram for such a resonance situa-<lb/>tion. The process can be visualised as follows: after the <lb/>second 1S electron is virtually captured, the system lives <lb/>long enough for one of the 1S holes to be filled by the 2P <lb/> Fig. 2.

The resonance condition is fulfilled if the energy <lb/>of the resulting Kα X-ray transition coincides with the <lb/>energy available for the internal bremsstrahlung photon. <lb/>The rate can be expressed [6] as <lb/> Γ <lb/> 0νγ  (Q) = <lb/> Γ <lb/> r  (2P → 2S) <lb/>[Q − Q  res  (Z − 2)  2  ] + <lb/>  Γ  r <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2  |R  0ν  | <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where Q is the available bremsstrahlung energy Q  res  (Z − <lb/> 2) is the Kα X-ray energy in the daughter atom and Γ  r  is <lb/>the natural width of the X-ray transition in the presence <lb/>of an additional 1S hole (the width of a hypersatellite <lb/>transition, of the order of 100 eV in heavy atoms). <lb/>Figure 3 shows the rate of the 0νECECγ process in <lb/>vicinity of the resonance. The enhancement attainable in <lb/>heavy emitters may reach in favourable cases several or-<lb/>ders of magnitude. This more than compensates the usual <lb/>retardate of a radiative process. For details of the the-<lb/>ory of the 0ν radiation double electron capture we refer <lb/>to [6,7,10,11].

			<body> is due to the presence of characteristic Kα X-rays and, in <lb/>cases of decays to excited states, of characteristic γ-rays <lb/> de-exciting these states. The resonance conditions favour <lb/>in many cases decays to such states, while in the β <lb/> −  β <lb/> − <lb/> case the Q <lb/> 5  -dependence of the rate strongly inhibits the <lb/>process. Without a coincidence trigger the requirements of <lb/>shielding and purity of all the material, necessary in order <lb/>to suppress the overwhelming random background, tend <lb/>to the extremes. Other advantages such as, e.g., the low <lb/>physical background due to the competing two neutrino <lb/>radiative process, are discussed in [6,10]. <lb/>There are several candidates for 0νECEC decays which <lb/>might meet the resonance condition. The rate estimates, <lb/>however, suffer from large uncertainties due to low pre-<lb/>cision of mass measurements, typically a few keV to be <lb/>compared with the resonance width of ∼ 0.1 keV. <lb/>Mass measurements of the required accuracy are <lb/>within the present state-of-the art, but have yet to be <lb/>done. The nuclei to be considered are, e.g., <lb/> 112  Sn, <lb/> 136  Ce, <lb/> 152  Gd, <lb/> 162  Er, <lb/> 164  Er and <lb/> 180  W. The corresponding Q−Q  res <lb/> energy values in keV are −5.8(4.6), 27(13), 0.04(3.5), <lb/> −10.5(4), 5(4), 12(5), where Q is the decay energy avail-<lb/>able for the process [12] and Q  res  is the resonance energy; <lb/>see [6] for details. <lb/> 3 Searching for Majorana neutrinos with beta <lb/>beams <lb/> 3.1 Beta beams <lb/> The present plans for developing high flux, high energy <lb/>neutrino beams, the so-called &quot; neutrino factories &quot; , are <lb/>mainly motivated by the need for the next generation, <lb/>high precision neutrino oscillation experiments. Once con-<lb/>structed, however, these facilities will inevitably be used <lb/>for a number of other research projects. The principle is <lb/>to produce a high intensity beam of a neutrino progenitor, <lb/>be it muons or beta-decaying ions, accelerate these species <lb/>to highly relativistic energies and store in a ring ([13,14, <lb/>15] and references therein). The &quot; ring &quot; will have a long <lb/>straight-linear section. The neutrinos produced during the <lb/>flight in this section will undergo a kinematical focusing <lb/>and a relativistic energy boost. The former concentrates <lb/>the neutrino beam at the detector (the &quot; target &quot; ), the <lb/>latter offers a dramatic increase of the interaction cross-<lb/>section in the detector. The purpose of the present paper <lb/>is to consider the use of the beta beam born neutrinos <lb/>to study other fundamental properties of neutrinos: their <lb/>Majorana or Dirac nature, the lepton number conserva-<lb/>tion hypothesis and the absolute mass scale. <lb/> 3.2 The principle of experiment <lb/> The Majorana neutrinos produced in β <lb/> −  or in β <lb/> +  , EC <lb/>decays differ only by their helicity. If ν is massive then <lb/>in either kind of the decay there is an admixture of the <lb/>helicity opposite to the dominating one. The magnitude <lb/>of this admixture depends on the neutrino rest mass, m  ν  , <lb/>and its energy in the center of mass frame of the decaying <lb/>species, E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν  : <lb/> f <lb/> m  ν  , E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν <lb/>  ∼ <lb/> m  ν <lb/> 2E  CM <lb/> ν <lb/>  2 <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>We assume having <lb/>i) beams of either ν  e  or ν  e  with 100% purity <lb/>ii) detectors with 100% selectivity to neutrinos of a <lb/>given helicity. <lb/>We consider two situations: <lb/>a) single beam, two different detectors <lb/>b) single detector, two different beams. <lb/>For the purpose of the present argument these situa-<lb/>tions are equivalent. <lb/>Consider the case of the single ν beam and two differ-<lb/>ent detectors labelled (det ν) and (det ν). (In the following <lb/>we use the notation ν, ν for the neutrinos with dominating <lb/>left or right handed helicity, respectively.) The correspond-<lb/>ing rates observed by the two detectors are: <lb/> N  ν  (det ν) ∼ N <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν  σ  νn <lb/> E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν <lb/> , <lb/>N  ν  (det ν) ∼ N <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν  σ  νp <lb/> E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν <lb/> f <lb/> m  ν  , E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν <lb/> , <lb/> where N <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν  is the neutrino flux at the detector, E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν <lb/> is <lb/>the boosted neutrino energy in the laboratory frame and <lb/> σ  νn  (E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν  ), σ  νp  (E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν  ) are the cross-sections for the boosted <lb/>neutrinos of the dominating and the admixed helicity, re-<lb/>spectively. The admixed fraction, f , can then be expressed <lb/>by the measured and/or calculated quantities: <lb/> f <lb/> m  ν  , E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν <lb/> = <lb/> N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>σ  νp  (E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν  ) <lb/> σ  νn  (E  lab <lb/>ν  ) <lb/> ε  νn  (E <lb/> lab <lb/>ν  ) <lb/> ε  νp  (E  lab <lb/>ν  ) <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where ε  νn  , ε  νp  denote the detector efficiencies. The nota-<lb/>tion corresponds to the vector current interactions (ν-n) <lb/>and (ν-p), respectively. Note that for any observation an-<lb/>gle there is a continuous energy spectrum depending on <lb/>energy and emission angle in the CMS. <lb/>The detection cross-sections can be calculated, al-<lb/>beit with sizeable nuclear structure uncertainties. Alterna-<lb/>tively, they can be determined experimentally. In the ideal <lb/>case of the experiment done with ν and ν beams of the <lb/>same energy and with the two different detectors, the <lb/> f (m  ν  , E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν  ) function can be expressed in a simplified <lb/>way. The terms of the detector efficiencies and the cross-<lb/>sections (and thus of the nuclear structure dependence) <lb/>cancel: <lb/> f <lb/> m  ν  , E <lb/> CM <lb/> ν <lb/> = <lb/> N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>N  ν  (det ν) <lb/>. <lb/> (5) <lb/> 4 Helicity admixture estimates <lb/> 4.1 Admixture in the CM system <lb/> Consider the <lb/> 6  He decay (this is the prime candidate <lb/>presently proposed for the beta beam, see the CERN fea-<lb/>sibility study, [16]): <lb/></body>

The <lb/> &quot; helicity flip &quot; <lb/> The helicity composition of the boosted beam of massive <lb/>neutrinos will differ from that in the CM system. This <lb/>comes about from the &quot; helicity flip &quot; of the neutrinos emit-<lb/>ted in CM and reoriented due the boost in laboratory. <lb/>Similar effect has been considered in [17] for pion decay. <lb/>The very tiny rest mass of neutrinos, however, means that <lb/>the gain in the helicity admixture is not very spectacular, <lb/>at least not for the boosts presently attainable. <lb/>The ratio R of boosted admixture to that in the CMS <lb/>can be very well approximated for a large range of labo-<lb/>ratory energies by the formula [18]: <lb/> R = <lb/> E  max <lb/> E  lab  = 2γE <lb/> CM  /E <lb/> lab <lb/> Taking a mono-energetic neutrino, e.g., 25keV in <lb/>CMS, and γ = 1000 one gets E  max  = 50 MeV and thus at <lb/> E <lb/> lab  = 1 MeV the gain factor R = 50. <lb/> 5 Conclusions and outlook <lb/> – Neutrino oscillations prove that at least one of the neu-<lb/>trino species has a finite rest mass and that the lepton <lb/>flavour is not conserved. Information from other kind <lb/>of data is needed to determine the values of neutrino <lb/>masses, to establish the mass hierarchy and to test to-<lb/>tal lepton number conservation hypothesis. <lb/> – Neutrinoless double beta decay offers the most sen-<lb/>sitive way to determine the effective neutrino mass. <lb/>If discovered, it proves unambiguously the Majorana <lb/>nature of neutrinos as well as the lepton number non-<lb/>conservation. <lb/> – The radiative neutrinoless double electron capture is <lb/>a promising alternative to the electron emission, with <lb/>definite experimental advantages. <lb/> – Strong, resonance enhancement is predicted at pho-<lb/>ton energy equal to the energy difference of the 1S-2P <lb/>atomic state. <lb/> – Experiments with beta beams can in principle provide <lb/>information equivalent to that from the double beta <lb/>decay. The rates are discouraging but improvements <lb/>possible. <lb/></body>

Starting from chiral Lagrangians, possessing the SU (2)L × SU (2)R local chiral symmetry, we <lb/>derive weak axial one-boson exchange currents in the leading order in the 1/M expansion (M is the <lb/>nucleon mass), suitable for the nuclear physics calculations beyond the threshold energies and with the <lb/>wave functions, obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation with the one-boson exchange potentials. The <lb/>constructed currents obey the nuclear form of the partial conservation of the axial current. We apply the <lb/>space component of these currents in calculations of the cross-sections for the disintegration of deuterons <lb/>by the low-energy neutrinos. The deuteron and the <lb/> 1  S0 final-state nucleon-nucleon wave functions are <lb/>derived i) from a variant of the OBEPQB potential and ii) from the Nijmegen 93 and Nijmegen I nucleon-<lb/>nucleon interactions. The extracted values of the constant L  1, A,  entering the axial exchange currents of the <lb/>pionless effective field theory (EFT), are in agreement with those predicted by the dimensional analysis. The <lb/>comparison of our cross-sections with those obtained within the pionless EFT and other potential model <lb/>calculations shows that the solar neutrino-deuteron cross-sections can be calculated within an accuracy of <lb/> ≈ 3.3%. <lb/> PACS. 11.40.Ha Partially conserved axial-vector currents – 25.30.-c Nuclear reactions: specific reactions: <lb/>Lepton-induced reactions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The semileptonic weak nuclear interaction has been stud-<lb/>ied for half a century. The cornerstones of this field of <lb/>research are i) the chiral symmetry, ii) the conserved vec-<lb/>tor current and iii) the partial conservation of the axial <lb/>current (PCAC). In the formulation [1], the PCAC reads <lb/> q  μ  Ψ  f  |j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (q)|Ψ  i  = if  π  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  Δ <lb/> π <lb/>F <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>  Ψ  f  |m <lb/> a <lb/>π  (q)|Ψ  i  , (1) <lb/>where j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (q) is the total weak axial isovector hadron <lb/>current, m <lb/> a <lb/>π  (q) is the pion source (the pion produc-<lb/>tion/absorption amplitude) and |Ψ  i,f  is the wave function <lb/>describing the initial (i) or final (f ) nuclear state. It has <lb/>been recognized [2] in studying the triton beta decay <lb/> 3  H → <lb/> 3  He + e <lb/> −  + ¯ <lb/> ν , <lb/> (2) <lb/>and the muon capture [3] <lb/> μ <lb/> −  + <lb/> 3  He → <lb/> 3  H + ν  μ  , <lb/> (3) <lb/> μ <lb/> −  + d → n + n + ν  μ  , <lb/> (4) <lb/> a  e-mail: mosconi@fi.infn.it <lb/> b  e-mail: ricci@fi.infn.it <lb/> c  e-mail: truhlik@ujf.cas.cz <lb/> that in addition to the one-nucleon current, the effect <lb/>of the space component of weak axial exchange currents <lb/>(WAECs) enhances sensibly the Gamow-Teller matrix ele-<lb/>ments entering the transition rates. This suggests that the <lb/>current j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (q) can be understood for the system of A nu-<lb/>cleons as the sum of the one-and two-nucleon components, <lb/> j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (q) = <lb/> A <lb/> i=1 <lb/> j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (1, i, q  i  ) + <lb/> A <lb/> i&lt;j <lb/> j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (2, ij, q) . <lb/> (5) <lb/>Let us describe the nuclear system by the Schrödinger <lb/>equation <lb/> H|Ψ  = E|Ψ  , H = T + V , <lb/> (6) <lb/>where H is the nuclear Hamiltonian, T is the kinetic en-<lb/>ergy and V is the nuclear potential describing the interac-<lb/>tion between nucleon pairs.

(8) <lb/>If the WAECs are constructed so that they satisfy <lb/>eq. (8), then the matrix element of the total current, sand-<lb/>wiched between solutions of the nuclear equation of mo-<lb/>tion (6), satisfies the PCAC (1). <lb/>It is known from the dimensional analysis [4], that the <lb/>space component of the WAECs, j <lb/> a <lb/> 5  (2, q), is of the or-<lb/>der O(1/M <lb/> 3  ). Being of a relativistic origin, it is model <lb/>dependent. This component of the WAECs was derived <lb/>by several authors in various models. In the standard nu-<lb/>clear physics approach [5,6,7,8,9], the model systems of <lb/>strongly interacting particles contain various particles (ef-<lb/>fective degrees of freedom), such as N , Δ(1236), π, ρ, <lb/>ω and other baryons and mesons. Using these effective <lb/>degrees of freedom and chiral Lagrangians, it was possi-<lb/>ble to describe reasonably nuclear electroweak phenomena <lb/>in the whole region of intermediate energies. In particu-<lb/>lar, the existence of mesonic degrees of freedom in nuclei, <lb/>manifesting themselves via meson exchange currents, was <lb/>proven to a high degree of reliability [3]. <lb/>One of the employed Lagrangians is the one [5] contain-<lb/>ing the heavy meson fields ρ and a  1  , taken as the Yang-<lb/>Mills gauge fields [10]. It reflects the SU (2)  L  × SU (2)  R <lb/> local chiral symmetry. Another used Lagrangian has been <lb/>built up [11] within the concept of hidden local symme-<lb/>tries [12,13]. Besides possessing the chiral symmetry, our <lb/>Lagrangians are characterized by the following proper-<lb/>ties: i) They respect the vector dominance model, repro-<lb/>duce universality, KSFRI, FSFR2, ii) they provide correct <lb/>anomalous magnetic moment of the a  1  -meson, iii) at the <lb/>tree-level approximation, they correctly describe elemen-<lb/>tary processes in the whole region of intermediate energies <lb/>(E &lt; 1 GeV) and iv) the current algebra prediction for the <lb/>weak pion production amplitude is reproduced. Using such <lb/>an approach, the exchange currents are constructed as fol-<lb/>lows. First, one derives the exchange amplitudes J <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (2) as <lb/>Feynman tree graphs. These amplitudes satisfy the PCAC <lb/>equation <lb/> q  μ  J <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ  (2) = if  π  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  Δ <lb/> π <lb/>F  (q <lb/> 2  ) M <lb/> a  (2) , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where M <lb/> a  (2) are the associated pion absorption/produc-<lb/>tion amplitudes <lb/> 1  . The nuclear exchange currents are con-<lb/>structed from these amplitudes in conjunction with the <lb/>equation, describing the nuclear states. Such exchange <lb/>currents, combined with the one-nucleon currents, should <lb/>satisfy eq. (1). In the present case, we describe the nuclear <lb/>system by the Hamiltonian H = T + V and the nuclear <lb/>states by the Schrödinger equation (6). The nuclear ex-<lb/>change currents are constructed within the extended S-<lb/> matrix method, in analogy with the electromagnetic me-<lb/>son exchange currents [15], as the difference between the <lb/></body>

This method <lb/>has already been applied [16,17] to construct the space <lb/>component of the WAECs of the pion range. <lb/>On the other hand, EFTs are being developed since <lb/>the early &apos;90s. In this approach, one starts from a general <lb/>chiral invariant Lagrangian with heavy-particle degrees of <lb/>freedom integrated out and preserving N , Δ(1232) and <lb/> π [18], or N and π [19,20], or only nucleons [21,22]. Such <lb/>EFTs rely on systematic counting rules and on the exis-<lb/>tence of an expansion parameter, governing a perturbation <lb/>scheme that converges reasonably fast. The expansion pa-<lb/>rameter is given as the ratio of the light and heavy scales. <lb/>In the pionless EFT [21,22], the heavy scale Λ is set <lb/>to the pion mass m  π  . This choice restricts the application <lb/>of the scheme to the processes taking place at threshold <lb/>energies, such as the interaction of solar neutrinos with the <lb/>deuterons [23]. In the EFT with pions, the heavy scale is <lb/> Λ ≈ 4πf  π  ≈ 1 GeV, restricting the application of the EFT <lb/>to low energies. <lb/>The goal of this study is twofold: i) The construc-<lb/>tion of the WAECs of the heavy-meson range, suitable <lb/>in the standard nuclear physics calculations beyond the <lb/>long-wave limit, with the nuclear wave functions gener-<lb/>ated from the Schrödinger equation using the one-boson <lb/>exchange potentials (OBEPs). ii) An application of the <lb/>developed formalism to the description of the interaction <lb/>of the low-energy neutrinos with the deuterons, <lb/> ν  x  + d −→ ν <lb/> x  + n + p , <lb/> (10) <lb/> ν  x  + d −→ ν <lb/> x  + n + p , <lb/> (11) <lb/> ν  e  + d −→ e <lb/> −  + p + p , <lb/> (12) <lb/> ν  e  + d −→ e <lb/> +  + n + n , <lb/> (13) <lb/>where ν  x  refers to any active flavor of the neutrino.

			<body> The cross-sections for the reactions (10) and (12) are im-<lb/>portant for the analysis of the results obtained in the SNO <lb/>detector [24,25,26]. The standard nuclear physics calcula-<lb/>tions [27,28] generally differ [23] by 5%–10%, which pro-<lb/>vides a good motivation to make independent calculations <lb/>aiming to reduce this uncertainty. <lb/>In ref. [23], the effective cross-sections for the reac-<lb/>tions (10)-(13) are presented in the form <lb/> σ  EFT  (E  ν  ) = a(E  ν  ) + L  1, A  b(E  ν  ) . <lb/> (14) <lb/>The amplitudes a(E  ν  ) and b(E  ν  ) are tabulated in [23] for <lb/>each of the reactions (10)-(13) from the lowest possible <lb/>(anti)neutrino energy up to 20 MeV, with 1 MeV step. <lb/>The constant L  1, A  cannot be determined from reactions <lb/>between elementary particles. Here we extract L  1, A  from <lb/>our cross-sections calculated in the approximations of [23]: <lb/>only the <lb/> 1  S  0  wave is taken into account in the nucleon-<lb/>nucleon final state and the nucleon variables are treated <lb/>non-relativistically. The knowledge of L  1, A  allows us to <lb/>compare our cross-sections with σ  EFT  (E  ν  ). <lb/> 2 Weak axial nuclear exchange currents <lb/> The starting quantities of our construction are the rel-<lb/>ativistic Feynman amplitudes J <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ,B  (2) of the range B <lb/> (B = π, ρ, ω, a  1  ). These amplitudes satisfy the PCAC <lb/>constraint (9). The WAECs j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ, B  (2) of the range B are <lb/>defined as [14] <lb/> j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ, B  (2) = J <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ, B  (2) − t <lb/> a, FBI <lb/>5μ, B  , <lb/> (15) <lb/>where t <lb/> a, FBI <lb/>5μ, B  is the first Born iteration of the one-nucleon <lb/>current contribution to the two-nucleon scattering ampli-<lb/>tude, satisfying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation [15]. <lb/>The PCAC for the WAECs, defined in eq. (15), is given <lb/>by <lb/> q  μ  j <lb/> a <lb/> 5μ, B  (2) = ([V  B  , ρ <lb/> a <lb/> 5  (1)] + (1 ↔ 2)) <lb/>+ if  π  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  Δ <lb/> π <lb/>F <lb/>  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m <lb/> a <lb/>B  (2) , <lb/> (16) <lb/>where the nuclear pion production/absorption amplitude <lb/>is given by <lb/> m <lb/> a <lb/>B  (2) = M <lb/> a <lb/>B  (2) − m <lb/> a, FBI <lb/> B <lb/> , <lb/> (17) <lb/> V  B  is the potential of the range B and ρ <lb/> a <lb/> 5  (1) is the one-<lb/>nucleon axial charge density. We note here that the conti-<lb/>nuity equation (16) for our WAECs coincides with eq. (8). <lb/>It follows from eq. (16) that in order to make consistent <lb/>calculations of the exchange current effects, one should use <lb/>OBEPs for the generation of the nuclear wave functions <lb/>and apply in the WAECs the same couplings and strong <lb/>form factors as in the potentials. In our calculations, we <lb/>employ the realistic OBE potentials OBEPQG [29], Ni-<lb/>jmegen 93 (Nijm93) and Nijmegen I (NijmI) [30].

By compar-<lb/>ing them with the EFT cross-sections (14), we extract <lb/>the value of the constant L  1, A  . We also compare our <lb/>cross-sections with the cross-sections of refs. [27,28]. Our <lb/>WAECs contain the following components [14]: the pair <lb/>terms j <lb/> a <lb/> 5, B  (pair) (B = π, ρ, ω), the non-potential ex-<lb/>change currents j <lb/> a <lb/> 5, π  (ρπ), j <lb/> a <lb/> 5, a1 ρ  (a  1  ) and the Δ excitation <lb/>terms j <lb/> a <lb/> 5, B  (Δ) (B = π, ρ). <lb/> The pion exchange part of our model WAECs is simi-<lb/>lar to the one employed in [27]. The representative cross-<lb/>sections, presented in table I of ref. [27], are calculated <lb/>using the AV18 potential [33], that is another high-quality <lb/>second-generation potential <lb/> 2  and the S- and P -waves are <lb/>taken into account in the nucleon-nucleon final states. <lb/>We also compare our results with those reported in <lb/>table I of ref. [28], where the calculations were performed <lb/>i) with the Paris potential [34]; ii) with the currents taken <lb/>in the impulse approximation; iii) with the S- and P -waves <lb/>taken into account in the nucleon-nucleon final states. <lb/> 3 Numerical results <lb/> Using the technique developed in refs. [35,36] one obtains <lb/>the equations for the cross-sections σ  pot  (E  ν  ) that can be <lb/>found in [14]. The equations are the same as those of <lb/>ref. [27], but we treat the nucleon variables in the phase <lb/>space non-relativistically. In ref.

Besides, we give the <lb/>differences between the cross-sections, computed with the <lb/>wave functions of various potential models. <lb/>Comparing the columns NijmI and NSGK of table 3 we <lb/>can see that the NSGK cross-section is closer to the EFT <lb/>cross-section. This means that the standard approach and <lb/>the pionless EFT differ, since the approximations, made <lb/>in our calculations and in EFT, coincide: the nucleon-<lb/>nucleon final state is restricted to the <lb/> 1  S  0  wave and the <lb/>nucleon variables are treated non-relativistically. Besides, <lb/>the inspection of columns Δ  1  and Δ  2  shows that our cross-<lb/>sections closely follow the NSGK cross-section up to the <lb/>energies when the P -waves in the nucleon-nucleon final <lb/>state start to contribute. On the other hand, as follows <lb/>from column Δ  3  , it is difficult to understand the behav-<lb/>ior of the cross-section σ  YHH  in the whole interval of the <lb/>considered neutrino energies. <lb/> 3.2 Reaction ¯ <lb/> ν  x  + d −→ ¯ <lb/> ν <lb/> x  + n + p <lb/> In analogy with sect. 3.1, we present in table 4 a compar-<lb/>ative analysis for the reaction (11). <lb/>Clearly, our cross-sections are closer to σ  EFT  and also <lb/>to the cross-section σ  NSGK  , than in the neutrino-deuteron <lb/>case of table 3.

			<body> Inspecting the difference of the cross-sections Δ  3  shows <lb/>that the cross-section [28] is of the correct size in this case. <lb/> 3.4 Reaction ¯ <lb/> ν  e  + d −→ e <lb/> + <lb/> + n + n <lb/> It follows from table 6 that our cross-sections for the reac-<lb/>tion (13) are in a very good agreement with the EFT [23] <lb/>and [27] calculations. This confirms our conjecture that <lb/>the treatment of the Coulomb interaction between pro-<lb/>tons [23] in the reaction (12) is not correct. <lb/>The calculations [28] provide a too small cross-section. <lb/>The most probable reason for this large difference is that <lb/>the Paris potential does not describe the neutron-neutron <lb/>interaction correctly. <lb/> 4 Conclusions <lb/> We calculated here the cross-sections for the reactions of <lb/>the solar neutrinos with the deuterons, (10)-(13), within <lb/>the standard nuclear physics approach. We took into ac-<lb/>count the weak axial exchange currents of the OBE type, <lb/>satisfying the nuclear continuity equation (8). These cur-<lb/>rents were constructed from the Lagrangians, possessing <lb/>the chiral local SU (2)  L  × SU (2)  R  symmetry, in the tree <lb/>approximation. Using the OBE potentials NijmI, Nijm93 <lb/>and OBEPQG, we made consistent calculations. We took <lb/>into account the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the <lb/> 1  S  0 <lb/> final state and we treated non-relativistically the nucleon <lb/>variables. <lb/>Our cross-sections for the reactions (10), (11) and (13) <lb/>agree with the EFT cross-sections [23] and also with the <lb/>cross-sections [27] within an accuracy better than 3%. The <lb/>agreement for the reaction (12) is within 3.3%. In our opin-<lb/>ion, the agreement for the reaction (12) can be improved <lb/>by paying more attention to the treatment of the Coulomb <lb/>interaction between the protons in the final state in the <lb/>pionless EFT calculations. <lb/> This work is supported in part by the grant GA CR <lb/>202/03/0210 and by Ministero dell&apos;Istruzione, dell&apos;Universià e <lb/>della Ricerca of Italy (PRIN 2003).

			<body>Received: 24 May 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 23 February 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. The astrophysical reaction rates of the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne capture reaction and its inverse <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O photodisintegration reaction are given by the sum of several narrow resonances and a small <lb/>direct capture contribution at low temperatures. Although the thermal population of low-lying excited <lb/>states in <lb/> 16  O and <lb/> 20  Ne is extremely small, the first excited state in <lb/> 20  Ne plays a non-negligible role for <lb/>the photodisintegration rate.

			<body> 3 Discussion <lb/> There are several interesting aspects which arise from the <lb/>calculations in sect. 2. As already pointed out, the first ex-<lb/>cited states of <lb/> 16  O and <lb/> 20  Ne have relatively high excitation <lb/>energies. E.g., at T  9  = 1 this leads to occupation probabil-<lb/>ities of 3 × 10 <lb/> −31  for the 0 <lb/> +  state in <lb/> 16  O at E  x  = 6049 keV <lb/>and 3 × 10 <lb/> −8  for the 2 <lb/> +  state in <lb/> 20  Ne at E  x  = 1634 keV. <lb/>The normalized partition functions practically do not de-<lb/>viate from unity up to T  9  = 3 [2]. <lb/>The reaction rate σv for the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne capture <lb/>reaction can be determined from laboratory experiments <lb/>because the rates under stellar and laboratory conditions <lb/>are identical for this reaction: <lb/> σv <lb/>  = σv <lb/> lab  . <lb/> (18) <lb/>However, this is not the case for the reaction rate of the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O photodisintegration reaction under stellar <lb/>conditions and in the laboratory: <lb/> λ <lb/>  = λ <lb/> lab  . <lb/> (19) <lb/>The stellar reaction rate λ <lb/>  for a resonance is given by <lb/>eq. (16); the full resonance strength (ωγ) of the capture <lb/>reaction contributes to the stellar photodisintegration rate <lb/> λ <lb/>  . The laboratory reaction rate λ <lb/> 0  is reduced by the <lb/>branching ratio B <lb/> 0  to the ground state as can be seen <lb/>from eq. (13). It is interesting to note that for the cho-<lb/>sen example of the 1 <lb/> −  resonance at E  R  = 5788 keV the <lb/>laboratory rate λ <lb/> 0  is only 18% of the stellar rate λ <lb/>  be-<lb/>cause of the branching ratio B <lb/> 0  . The first excited state at <lb/> E  x  = 1634 keV in <lb/> 20  Ne contributes with 82% to the stel-<lb/>lar rate λ <lb/>  although the thermal occupation probability is <lb/>only 3×10 <lb/> −8  at T  9  = 1! The reason for this surprising con-<lb/>tribution can be understood from eqs. (9) and (14). The <lb/>small thermal occupation probability at E  x  = 1634 keV is <lb/>exactly compensated by the much higher photon density <lb/>at the required energy E <lb/> γ <lb/>R  = E <lb/> α <lb/>R  + Q − E <lb/> 1634 <lb/> x <lb/> . <lb/>The contribution of the laboratory reaction rate λ <lb/> lab <lb/> to the stellar rate λ <lb/>  (taken from the detailed-balance cal-<lb/>culation of [2]) is shown in fig. 2. The contributions of <lb/>these resonances to the stellar <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reaction rate <lb/> λ <lb/>  are identical to the contributions in the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne <lb/>reaction rate which is shown in fig. 1. <lb/>The ratio λ <lb/>  /σv does not depend on individual prop-<lb/>erties of the respective resonance. Consequently, eq. (17) <lb/>is also valid for the direct capture contribution which <lb/>becomes relevant at relatively low temperatures. The <lb/>detailed-balance theorem hence is also applicable to re-<lb/>actions between nuclei with high-lying first excited states <lb/>as, e.g., the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne and <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reactions. <lb/>Further details on the direct capture contribution at low <lb/>energies are given in [7]. <lb/>A further consequence of the relation between cap-<lb/>ture and photodisintegration reactions is that the so-called <lb/>Gamow windows of both reactions have a strict relation. <lb/>The Gamow window —the energy region where a reaction <lb/>mainly operates— of a capture reaction is characterized <lb/>by its position at <lb/> E  G  = 1.22 <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  Z <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  A  red  T <lb/> 2 <lb/>6 <lb/>  1/3  keV <lb/>(20) <lb/> 0 <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/> T  9 <lb/> 0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/> contribution (%) <lb/> 7422 <lb/>6725 <lb/>5788 <lb/>5621 <lb/> Fig. 2. Ground-state contribution λ <lb/> lab  /λ <lb/>  of individual res-<lb/>onances to the stellar reaction rate λ <lb/>  of the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O <lb/>photodisintegration reaction as given by detailed balance [2]. <lb/>The resonances are labelled by their energies ER in keV. There <lb/>is no contribution from the resonance at E  R  = 6725 keV be-<lb/>cause of B <lb/> 0  = 0 for this resonance. Note the different scale <lb/>(compared to fig. 1). <lb/> and its width Δ <lb/>Δ = 0.749 <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  Z <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  A  red  T <lb/> 5 <lb/>6 <lb/>  1/6  keV. <lb/>(21) <lb/>The corresponding Gamow window of the (γ, α) reaction <lb/>is shifted by the Q value of the reaction <lb/> E <lb/> γ <lb/> G  = E <lb/> α <lb/> G  + Q . <lb/> (22) <lb/>The width Δ remains the same for the (α, γ) and (γ, α) <lb/> reactions. <lb/>In the chosen example of the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne cap-<lb/>ture and <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O photodisintegration reactions, one <lb/>finds, e.g. at T  9  = 1, energies E <lb/> α <lb/> G  = 1141 keV and <lb/> E <lb/> γ <lb/> G  = 5871 keV and a width Δ = 725 keV. As an obvious <lb/>consequence the 1 <lb/> −  resonance at E  R  = 5788 keV is dom-<lb/>inating around T  9  = 1 (see also fig. 1). Properties of the <lb/>Gamow window for (γ, α) reactions have been discussed <lb/>in further detail in [8,9]. <lb/>As shown above, the detailed-balance theorem holds <lb/>for the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne and <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reactions pro-<lb/>vided that the population of excited states is thermal ac-<lb/>cording to the Boltzmann statistics. How long does it take <lb/>until thermal equilibrium is obtained in such cases where <lb/>the first excited states are only weakly populated? In gen-<lb/>eral, one can read from the formalism of photoactivation <lb/>with a constant production rate (which is approximately <lb/>fulfilled in the above case), that the time until equilibrium <lb/>is reached is a few times the lifetime of the unstable prod-<lb/>uct. In the case of the 2 <lb/> +  state in <lb/> 20  Ne at E  x  = 1634 keV <lb/>the mean lifetime is τ = 1.05 ps [4]. Compared to the <lb/>timescale of neon burning, which is of the order of years, <lb/>thermal equilibrium is reached almost instantaneously. <lb/></body>

			<body> disintegration reaction <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O is given by <lb/> Y = N  T  n  γ  (E  R  ) <lb/> ¯ hc <lb/>E  R <lb/>  2 <lb/> π <lb/> 2  B <lb/> 0  (2J  1  + 1)(2J  2  + 1) <lb/>(2J  3  + 1) <lb/>(ωγ). <lb/>(23) <lb/>Here N  T  is the number of target nuclei, and n  γ  (E  R  ) is the <lb/>number of incoming photons per energy interval and area <lb/>at the energy of the resonance E  R  . Using realistic num-<lb/>bers for present-day facilities and thin targets for direct <lb/>detection of the α-particles, one obtains a relatively small <lb/>yield. E.g., N  T  ≈ 10 <lb/> 17  , n  γ  ≈ 10 <lb/> 5  /keV cm <lb/> 2  s, and the weak <lb/>1 <lb/> −  resonance at E  R  = 5788 keV with the properties given <lb/>in table 1, leads to Y ≈ 0.5/d. For stronger resonances the <lb/>yields are higher by up to two orders of magnitude which <lb/>makes experiments difficult but feasible with present-day <lb/>facilities. <lb/>The astrophysical reaction rate λ <lb/> for the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O photodisintegration reaction is well defined <lb/>from experimental data of the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne capture <lb/>reaction. Nevertheless, experimental yields for several <lb/>resonances can be obtained simultaneously in one irradia-<lb/>tion using the quasi-thermal spectrum which will become <lb/>available at SPring-8 [6]. Consequently the ratios of all <lb/>observed resonances will be measured in one irradiation <lb/>—provided that the ground-state branching ratios are well <lb/>known. This might help to resolve minor discrepancies <lb/>between the adopted resonance strengths in [4] and [2]. <lb/>There are further interesting experimental properties <lb/>of the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reaction which have to be discussed <lb/>in the following. The analysis of experiments with <lb/>non-monochromatic photons (see, e.g., refs. [5,10,11,12]) <lb/>requires the precise knowledge of the absolute number of <lb/>incoming photons and their energy dependence. Using <lb/>a non-monochromatic photon spectrum in combination <lb/>with the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reaction (or any other photo-<lb/>disintegration reaction which is dominated by narrow <lb/>resonances) one finds emitted α-particles with discrete en-<lb/>ergies. Because the extremely high-lying first excited state <lb/>in <lb/> 16  O is practically not populated in the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O <lb/>reaction, the α energy is given by the difference between <lb/>the resonance energy E  R  and the Q value of the reaction. <lb/>The experimental yield in each of the discrete lines is <lb/>directly proportional to the resonance strength ωγ, the <lb/>ground-state branching B <lb/> 0  , and the number of incoming <lb/>photons n  γ  (E  R  ) at resonance energy, as can be read <lb/>from eq. (23). Provided that the resonance strengths and <lb/>the branching ratios are well known, a <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O <lb/>experiment may help to determine the properties of the <lb/>incoming-photon spectrum with good accuracy over a <lb/>broad energy range. This is especially relevant for the <lb/>measurement of (γ, α) reaction rates because the relevant <lb/>energy region, the so-called Gamow window, is much <lb/>broader than in the case of (γ, n) reactions which have <lb/>mainly been analyzed in the last years. The intrinsic <lb/>exponential decrease of photon intensity with energy for <lb/>the photon source suggested in [6] may help to avoid <lb/>the problems of reproducing the thermal photon distribu-<lb/>tion over a broad energy range which arise in the present <lb/>technique using a superposition of bremsstrahlung spec-<lb/>tra [5]. <lb/> 5 Conclusions <lb/> The relation between the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne capture reaction <lb/>and the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O photodisintegration reaction has <lb/>been discussed in detail. Whereas the stellar reaction rates <lb/>of the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne reaction are identical to the labora-<lb/>tory rates [2], this is not the case for the photodisinte-<lb/>gration rates under stellar and under laboratory condi-<lb/>tions. Although the thermal population of the first ex-<lb/>cited state in <lb/> 20  Ne remains extremely small at typical <lb/>temperatures of neon burning, it nevertheless provides an <lb/>important contribution to the reaction rate under stel-<lb/>lar conditions. The reason for this surprising behavior is <lb/>that the increasing number of thermal photons at the rel-<lb/>evant energy exactly compensates the small thermal occu-<lb/>pation probability according to the Boltzmann statistics. <lb/>The widely used detailed-balance theorem, which relates <lb/>reaction rates of capture reactions to photodisintegration <lb/>rates, remains valid for the case of the <lb/> 16  O(α, γ) <lb/> 20  Ne and <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O reactions. <lb/>Additionally, it has been shown that the <lb/> 20  Ne(γ, α) <lb/> 16  O <lb/>reaction may be helpful in calibrating new intense non-<lb/>monochromatic photon sources as, e.g., suggested in [6]. <lb/>Such a calibration over a broad energy interval is es-<lb/>pecially relevant for (γ, α) experiments because of the <lb/>broader Gamow window. <lb/></body>

The electron screening in the d(d,p)t reaction has been studied for the deuterated metal Pt at <lb/>a target temperature T = 20 <lb/> •  C to 340 <lb/> •  C, and for Co at T = 20 <lb/> •  C and 200 <lb/> •  C. The enhanced electron <lb/>screening decreases with increasing temperature, where the data agree with the plasma model of Debye <lb/>applied to the quasi-free metallic electrons. The data represent the first observation of a temperature <lb/>dependence of a nuclear cross-section. We also measured the screening effect for the deuterated metal Ti <lb/>(an element of group 4 of the periodic table) at T = −10 <lb/> •  C to 200 <lb/> •  C: above 50 <lb/> •  C the hydrogen solubility <lb/>dropped to values far below unity and a large screening effect became observable. Similarly, all metals of <lb/>groups 3 and 4 and the lanthanides showed a solubility of a few percent at T = 200 <lb/> •  C (compared to <lb/> T = 20 <lb/> •  C) and a large screening became also observable. Within the Debye model the deduced number <lb/>of valence electrons per metallic atom agrees with the corresponding number from the Hall coefficient, for <lb/>all metals investigated. <lb/> PACS. 25.10.+s Nuclear reactions involving few-nucleon systems – 95.30.-k Fundamental aspects of as-<lb/>trophysics – 25.45.-z <lb/> 2  H-induced reactions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The cross-section of a charged-particle–induced nuclear re-<lb/>action is enhanced at sub-Coulomb energies by the elec-<lb/>tron clouds surrounding the interacting nuclides, with an <lb/>enhancement factor [1] <lb/> f  lab  (E) = <lb/> E <lb/>E + U  e <lb/> exp(−2πη(E + U  e  ) + 2πη(E)) , (1) <lb/>for S(E + U  e  ) ≈ S(E), and where E is the center-of-<lb/>mass energy, η(E) the Sommerfeld parameter, and U  e <lb/> the screening potential energy. The electron screening in <lb/>d(d,p)t was studied previously for deuterated metals, in-<lb/>sulators, and semiconductors, i.e. 58 samples in total [2,3] <lb/>(see also [4,5]). As compared to measurements performed <lb/>with a gaseous D  2  target (U  e  = 25 eV [6]), a large screen-<lb/>ing was observed in the metals (of order U  e  = 300 eV), <lb/> a  e-mail: raiola@ep3.rub.de; for the LUNA Collaboration. <lb/> while a small (gaseous) screening was found for the insu-<lb/>lators and semiconductors. An exception was found for the <lb/>metals of groups 3 and 4 of the periodic table and the lan-<lb/>thanides, which showed a small screening; this is related to <lb/>their high hydrogen solubility y (= 1/x [2,3]), of the order <lb/>of unity (see also [7]), that gives the deuterated targets of <lb/>these metals the properties of insulators. Indeed, for the <lb/>metals with high U  e  values, the solubilities were small (a <lb/>few percent) leaving the metallic character of the samples <lb/>essentially unchanged. An explanation of the large screen-<lb/>ing was suggested [3] by the plasma screening of Debye ap-<lb/>plied to the quasi-free metallic electrons.

(3) <lb/>A comparison of the calculated and observed U  e  values <lb/>led to n  ef f  , which was for most metals of the order of <lb/>unity. The acceleration mechanism of the incident positive <lb/>ions leading to the high observed U  e  values is thus the <lb/>Debye electron cloud at the small radius R  D  , about one <lb/>tenth of the Bohr radius. The n  ef f  values were compared <lb/>with those deduced from the known Hall coefficient [8]: <lb/>within 2 standard deviations the two quantities agreed <lb/>for all metals. A critical test of the Debye model is the <lb/>predicted temperature dependence U  e  (T ) ∝ T <lb/> −1/2  (see <lb/>also below); for deuterated Pt at T = 20 <lb/> •  C and 100 <lb/> •  C <lb/>the data agreed with prediction [3]. <lb/>It is known [7] that the hydrogen solubility in metals <lb/>decreases with increasing temperature. Thus, at higher <lb/>temperatures the solubility of the metals of groups 3 and <lb/>4 and the lanthanides may be low enough (a few percent) <lb/>that large U  e  values can be observed and thus new n  ef f <lb/> values deduced. With the assumption that the tempera-<lb/>ture-dependent solubility y(T ) affects directly n  ef f  , one <lb/>obtains <lb/> U  e,D  (T )= <lb/> 1 <lb/>4.78·10  10 <lb/> (n  ef f  (T )(1−y(T ))ρa <lb/> T <lb/> [eV], y(T ) ≤ 1, <lb/>0, <lb/> y (T ) &gt; 1, <lb/>(4) <lb/>where a temperature dependence of n  ef f  (T ) is also taken <lb/>into account. We report on the measurement of such tem-<lb/>perature effects. <lb/> 2 Setup and experimental procedure <lb/> The equipment, procedures, and data analysis have been <lb/>described elsewhere [2,3]. Briefly, the surface of a given <lb/>sample was —in a first step— cleaned in situ by Kr <lb/>sputtering at 35 keV removing typically about 300 mono-<lb/>layers. The sample was —in a second step— deuterated <lb/>at a given deuteron energy until a saturated yield was <lb/>reached. This implantation procedure was repeated over <lb/>the full energy range of the planned experiment taking <lb/>typically about 4 days of running. Finally, the observed <lb/>thick-target yield curve was differentiated to arrive at a <lb/>thin-target yield curve, which was fitted using 2 free pa-<lb/>rameters, y(T ) and U  e  (T ): the absolute yield provided in-<lb/>formation on the hydrogen solubility y(T ) and the energy <lb/>dependence of the data gave the screening potential en-<lb/>ergy U  e  (T ). We tested also the stability of the solubility <lb/>against diffusion by switching the deuteron beam off for an <lb/>extended period (typically 6 hours); the subsequent yield <lb/>measurement was unchanged within experimental uncer-<lb/>tainty indicating a stable solubility, both at room temper-<lb/>ature and elevated temperatures. For the present measure-<lb/>ments at elevated temperatures a new target holder was <lb/> Fig. 1.

It consists of a diamond plate coated with a <lb/>metallic layer (area A = 20×20 mm <lb/> 2  , thickness t = 1 mm) <lb/>and heated by current flow. A given metal sheet (A = <lb/>15×17 mm <lb/> 2  ) is placed on top of the diamond plate with in-<lb/>terim plates (from bottom to top) of MACOR (t = 1 mm), <lb/>Cu (t = 3 mm), and MACOR (t = 1 mm). At the center of <lb/>the top MACOR plate there is a hole of ∅ = 5 mm diam-<lb/>eter, filled with another diamond of cylindrical shape and <lb/>2 mm height: it provides the thermal contact to the metal <lb/>foil. The metal foil is electrically insulated for current mea-<lb/>surement. Thermal elements measure the temperature at <lb/>the diamond plate and the metal foil (near the area of the <lb/>ion beam spot). The Si detectors in close geometry to the <lb/>metal foil were cooled to 0 <lb/> •  C using an Ultra Kryomat. <lb/>The beam direction and spot on target were defined by 2 <lb/>apertures, one of ∅ = 3 mm at a distance d = 62 cm from <lb/>the target and the other of ∅ = 6 mm at d = 280 cm; an <lb/>electric quadrupole triplet placed between the 2 apertures <lb/>was used to focus the beam.

The curve for T = 20 <lb/> •  C <lb/>represents well the bare S(E) factor, while the curve for T = <lb/>200 <lb/> •  C includes the electron screening with the Ue value given. <lb/> solubility of 10% leads to a 5% reduction in the maximum <lb/>value of U  e  , according to eq. (4). <lb/>Finally, all metals of groups 3 and 4 and the <lb/>lanthanides have been studied at T = 200 <lb/> •  C. The <lb/>astrophysical S(E) factor obtained at T = 200 <lb/> •  C for Hf <lb/>is compared in fig. 4 with that obtained at T = 20 <lb/> •  C: <lb/>at T = 200 <lb/> •  C the solubility is reduced to a few percent <lb/>and a large screening became observable, similarly as for <lb/>Ti. In fact, all these metals exhibited a large reduction in <lb/>solubility and thus showed a large screening, as expected <lb/>according to eq. (4). The results for all metals are sum-<lb/>marized in table 1, which also compares the deduced n  ef f <lb/> values with those from the Hall coefficient: there is again <lb/>an agreement between both quantities within two stan-<lb/>dard deviations, for all metals of the present and previous <lb/>work [3], i.e. 49 metals in total. As a consistency test we <lb/>also studied the insulator C at T = 200 <lb/> •  C: the solubility <lb/>decreased from 0.35 (T = 20 <lb/> •  C) to 0.15, but no enhanced <lb/>screening was observed, as expected for an insulator with <lb/> n  ef f  = 0 (eq. (4)). <lb/> 5 Discussion <lb/> All data on the enhanced electron screening in deuter-<lb/>ated metals can be explained quantitatively by the Debye <lb/>model applied to the quasi-free metallic electrons. It was <lb/>argued [3] that most of the conduction electrons are frozen <lb/>by quantum effects and only electrons close to the Fermi <lb/>energy (E  F  ) actually should contribute to screening, with <lb/> n  ef f  (T ) = 0.67 <lb/> kT <lb/>E  F <lb/> ∝ T , <lb/> (5) <lb/>and thus there should be essentially no temperature de-<lb/>pendence for U  e,D  . However, this argument applies only <lb/>to insulators and semiconductors with a finite energy gap, <lb/>while for metals there is no energy gap and the Fermi <lb/>energy lies within the conduction band. Note that the ob-<lb/>served n  ef f  (T ) from the Hall coefficient decreases with <lb/>increasing T , e.g. for Pt, contrary to eq. (5). Clearly, an <lb/>improved theory is highly desirable to explain why the <lb/>simple Debye model appears to work so well. Without <lb/>such a theory, one may consider the Debye model as a <lb/>powerful parameterization of the data. <lb/> This work was supported by BMBF (05CL1PC1), DFG <lb/>(Ro429/31, 436Ung113), AvH (V-8100/B-ITA1066680), <lb/>OTKA (T42733, T49245), China (2003CB716704), Portugal <lb/>(FNU-45092-2002) and Dynamitron-Tandem-Laboratorium. <lb/></body>

The study of the <lb/> 2  H(d, p) <lb/> 3  H reaction at very low energies in deuterized metallic targets provides <lb/>a unique possibility to test models of the electron screening developed for dense astrophysical plasmas. <lb/>Here, we compare the experimental screening energies obtained by our group as well as by other authors <lb/>for different target materials with theoretical predictions based on an improved dielectric function theory. <lb/>The calculations are performed within the self-consistent regime and include polarization of both quasi-<lb/>free and bound electrons. Additionally, the cohesion screening, arising from different binding energies of <lb/>deuterons and α-particles in crystal lattices, is taken into account. The proposed theory predicts only a <lb/>weak material dependence of the screening energy in agreement with our experimental results but fails in <lb/>the absolute strength of the effect by a factor of 2. The projectile-velocity dependence of the screening <lb/>energy corresponding to the transition from the weak-screening regime to the strong-screening limit is <lb/>discussed. <lb/> PACS. 25.45.Hi Transfer reactions – 95.30.Dr Atomic processes and interactions – 95.30.-k Fundamental <lb/>aspects of astrophysics <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Electron screening of the Coulomb barrier between react-<lb/>ing nuclei leads to an enhancement of thermonuclear rates <lb/>in dense astrophysical plasmas. For so-called weakly cou-<lb/>pled plasmas (for example our Sun), where the kinetic en-<lb/>ergy of plasma particles is larger than the mean Coulomb <lb/>repulsion energy, the electron screening contributes only <lb/>to a few percent and can be described within the Debye-<lb/>Hückel model [1] of the nearly perfect stellar gas. In the <lb/>opposite limit of strongly coupled plasmas, at high densi-<lb/>ties and low temperatures the electron gas is degenerate <lb/>and the ions undergo long-range correlation forces form-<lb/>ing either a quantum liquid or a Coulomb lattice beyond <lb/>a critical density. In such a case nuclear reaction rates <lb/>can be increased by many orders of magnitude and are <lb/>probably realized in White and Brown Dwarfs or Giant <lb/>Planets. The study of d + d nuclear reactions at very low <lb/>energies on deuterons embedded in metallic lattices makes <lb/>it possible to test models of the electron screening de-<lb/>veloped for dense astrophysical plasmas in the terrestrial <lb/>laboratory. The exponential-like increase of the reaction <lb/>cross-section observed for decreasing projectile energies, <lb/>as compared to the cross-section for bare nuclei, can be <lb/> a  e-mail: czerski@kalium.physik.tu-berlin.de <lb/> described by a screening energy. As could be shown in our <lb/>first experiments [2,3], the screening energies determined <lb/>for the d + d fusion reactions in metallic environments are <lb/>by about a factor of 10 larger than that observed for the <lb/>gas target [4] and up to a factor of 4 larger than the the-<lb/>oretical predictions [5]. This finding was also confirmed <lb/>by results of other groups [6,7,8,9,10,11]. Especially, the <lb/>data obtained by the LUNA Collaboration for almost 60 <lb/>different target materials [11] enable us to compare the <lb/>experimental results of different groups and to look for <lb/>a theoretical description of the observed target material <lb/>dependence as well as of the absolute screening energy <lb/>values. The approach presented here is based on an im-<lb/>proved dielectric function theory [12,13] that allows to <lb/>derive a reliable deuteron-deuteron potential in the host <lb/>metal including contributions not only from quasi-free va-<lb/>lence electrons but also from polarized bound electrons. A <lb/>special interest will be devoted to the dependence of the <lb/>screening energy on projectile energies. <lb/> 2 Experimental screening energy <lb/> Our experiments have been performed [3,13,14] using the <lb/>D <lb/> +  and D <lb/> + <lb/></body>

The deuteron density used for the Li target <lb/>was even smaller (n  d  /n  Li  ≈ 0.03) to prevent the target <lb/>from oxidation. The reaction products (protons, tritons <lb/>and <lb/> 3  He particles) were detected by four Si detectors lo-<lb/>cated in the reaction plane at backward angles. <lb/>The experimental determination of the electron screen-<lb/>ing energy is based on the assumption that the observed <lb/>exponential-like enhancement of the reaction yield to-<lb/>wards low projectile energies results from the reduction <lb/>of the height of the Coulomb barrier. In the simple case <lb/>of Bohr screening, the screened Coulomb potential energy <lb/>between two reacting deuterons can be presented as fol-<lb/>lows: <lb/> V (r) = <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/> exp <lb/> − <lb/> r <lb/>a <lb/> ≈ <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/> − <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> a <lb/>, <lb/> (1) <lb/>where a is the screening length being of the order of the <lb/>Bohr radius. For projectile energies used in accelerator <lb/>experiments where r  a, the deuteron-deuteron poten-<lb/>tial can be simply described as the Coulomb potential re-<lb/>duced by a constant, the screening energy U  e  = e <lb/> 2  /a. <lb/> Thus, the &quot; screened &quot; cross-section, applying the transfor-<lb/>mation to the only weakly on energy dependent astrophys-<lb/>ical S-factor, reads as follows: <lb/> σ  scr  (E  cm  ) = <lb/>1 <lb/> E  cm  (E  cm  + U  e  ) <lb/> S (E  cm  ) <lb/> × exp <lb/> − <lb/> E  G <lb/> E  cm  + U  e <lb/> . <lb/> (2) <lb/>Here E  cm  denotes the energy in the center-of-mass sys-<lb/>tem and E  G  is the Gamow energy. The screening energy <lb/> U  e  takes into account a drop of the Coulomb barrier in <lb/>the expression for the penetration factor. In the experi-<lb/>ment the strength of the screening effect is described by <lb/>means of the thick-target enhancement factor F (E) de-<lb/>fined as the ratio between the angular integrated thick-<lb/>target yields for screened and bare nuclei [3], <lb/> F (E) = <lb/> Y  scr  (E) <lb/> Y  bare  (E) <lb/>= <lb/>  E <lb/> 0 <lb/> σscr(E) <lb/>ε(E)  dE <lb/>  E <lb/> 0 <lb/> σ(E) <lb/>ε(E)  dE <lb/>= <lb/>  E <lb/> 0 <lb/> σscr(E) <lb/> √ <lb/> E <lb/> dE <lb/>  E <lb/> 0 <lb/> σ(E) <lb/> √ <lb/> E <lb/> dE <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>Here, σ(E) and ε(E) are the cross-sections for bare nu-<lb/>clei and the stopping power taken at the beam energy E, <lb/> respectively. The enhancement factor F (E) is indepen-<lb/>dent of the target deuteron density and of the absolute <lb/>value of the stopping power; the only assumption used <lb/>is that ε(E) ∝ E <lb/> 1/2  which agrees with the experimental <lb/>data for all target materials investigated. The bare-nuclei <lb/>cross-section is very well known from the precision mea-<lb/>surements performed with the gas target [15]. From the <lb/>exponential increase of F (E) towards lower projectile en-<lb/>ergies the screening energy U  e  can be determined. The U  e <lb/> values obtained in our experiments for C, Li, Al, Zr, Pd <lb/>and Ta targets are presented in fig. 2. For heavier metals <lb/>the screening energy amounts to about 300 eV which is <lb/>one order of magnitude larger than the value 25 ± 5 eV <lb/>obtained in the gas target experiment [4]. <lb/> 3 Theoretical description of the electron <lb/>screening effect <lb/> A charge point impurity embedded in a metallic environ-<lb/>ment leads to a polarization of surrounding degenerate <lb/>electrons causing a cut-off of the screened Coulomb field <lb/>at a characteristic distance of the inverse of the Fermi <lb/>wave number. Additionally, the bound electrons of the <lb/>host metal can also be polarized and contribute to the <lb/>screening. Thus, using the standard Fourier representa-<lb/>tion of 1/r, the screened Coulomb potential energy V (r) <lb/>between reacting deuterons within a static approximation <lb/>can be expressed as follows [13]: <lb/> V (r) = <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/>Φ (r) <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π) <lb/> 3 <lb/>  4π (eϕ (q)) <lb/> 2 <lb/> ε  ν  (q) ε  c  (q) q  2  exp (iqr) d <lb/> 3  q , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where ε  ν  (q) and ε  c  (q) are the static wave-number– <lb/>dependent dielectric functions resulting from quasi-free <lb/>valence electrons and from bound metallic core electrons, <lb/>respectively, and Φ(r) denotes the screening function. <lb/>The elementary charge e is multiplied by a self-consistent <lb/>charge form factor ϕ(q) for deuterons with the screening <lb/>electrons in the Thomas-Fermi approximation: <lb/> ϕ (q) = 1 − z + zq <lb/> 2  / <lb/> q <lb/> 2  + k <lb/> 2 <lb/> T F <lb/> . <lb/> (5) <lb/>Here, the Thomas-Fermi wave number k <lb/> 2 <lb/> T F  = 6πe <lb/> 2  n/E  F <lb/> has been used; n and E  F  are the electron number density <lb/>and the Fermi energy, respectively. The number z corre-<lb/>sponds to the fraction of electrons bound to deuterons and <lb/>can vary between 0 and 1. Since we are interested in the <lb/>evaluation of the strongest possible screening effect, we set <lb/> z = 1. In the absence of screening ε  ν  ≡ ε  c  ≡ 1 and z = 0, <lb/> V (r) reduces to the bare Coulomb potential (Φ(r) ≡ 1). <lb/>The response of the valence electron gas to an external <lb/>field is given by the dielectric function: <lb/> ε  ν  (q) = 1 − <lb/> ν (q) P (q) <lb/>1 + ν (q) G (q) P (q) <lb/> , <lb/> (6) <lb/>where ν(q) = 4πe <lb/> 2  /q <lb/> 2  and P (q) is the static Lindhard <lb/>RPA polarizability [16]. G(q) is the static local field cor-<lb/>rection that takes into account the short-range electron <lb/>correlation and the exchange interaction [17]. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1. Screening function calculated for PdD with the lo-<lb/>cal field correction (LFC). For comparison the Bohr screening <lb/>function with the same screening length is presented. <lb/> If we set G(q) = 1 and apply the long-wave approxima-<lb/>tion [12], the expression for the valence electron dielectric <lb/>function (eq. (6)) reduces to the Thomas-Fermi form <lb/> ε  T F  (q) = 1 + <lb/> k <lb/> 2 <lb/> T F <lb/> q  2  . <lb/> (7) <lb/>In this case the screening function can be described by the <lb/>exponential function exp(−k  T F  r) leading to the screening <lb/>energy e <lb/> 2  k  T F  = e <lb/> 2  (4me <lb/> 2  /π <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 1/2  (3π2n) <lb/> 1/6  . Hence, the <lb/>corresponding value depends only weakly on the electron <lb/>density and amounts for Pd to 54 eV. <lb/>In the case of core electron polarization we applied <lb/>the dielectric function proposed in [18]. Different from <lb/>the valence electron polarization, ε  c  takes a finite value <lb/>at the limit q = 0. In the case of Ta the core-dielectric <lb/>constant ε  c  (0) = 3.21. The screening function Φ(r) calcu-<lb/>lated by a numeric integration of eq. (4) differs from the <lb/>simple Bohr screening exp(−r/a) particularly for larger <lb/>distances where the numeric potential becomes negative <lb/>and shows characteristic Friedel oscillations. For smaller <lb/>distances the potential becomes attractive reducing ap-<lb/>propriately the screening length (see fig. 1). <lb/>In the metallic lattice, besides electrons also posi-<lb/>tive ions can contribute to the screening of the Coulomb <lb/>barrier between reacting nuclei. This effect, called co-<lb/>hesion screening, can be calculated in analogy to the <lb/>dense astrophysical plasmas within the ion-sphere model <lb/>of Salpeter [1] providing in the case of the TaD target a <lb/>screening energy of 18 eV. In our calculations we used a <lb/>more realistic model based on the universal ion-ion poten-<lb/>tial introduced by Biersack [19]. This potential describes <lb/>the interaction between light ions as well as between heavy <lb/>ions at low energies with very good accuracy. Since the po-<lb/>tential energy of two deuterons in the field of a host metal <lb/>atom is larger than that of the helium atom produced in <lb/>the fusion reaction, one obtains a gain in potential energy. <lb/>For a rough estimation of the cohesion screening energy <lb/> U  coh  , we calculated the potential energy gain resulting <lb/>from the surrounding 12 host atoms assuming the same fcc <lb/>crystal structure for all target materials investigated [13]. <lb/>The above description of the screening effect is limited <lb/>to the charged particles with a velocity lower than the <lb/>Fermi velocity v  F  , for which the adiabatic approximation <lb/>can be used. For higher velocities the electrons have not <lb/>enough time to follow the ions and a wake wave [20] trails <lb/>the ion through the electron gas. Thus, the electron screen-<lb/>ing gets weaker and depends on the velocity v of the ion. <lb/>The screening length for the dynamic screening can be ex-<lb/>pressed by a  d  = v/ω  p  , where ω  p  is the plasmon frequency <lb/> ω <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  = 4πne <lb/> 2  /m. Since the ion velocity v can be treated <lb/>as velocity of electrons relative to the resting ion, the dy-<lb/>namic screening can also be applied to hot plasmas where <lb/>the electron velocity arises from the plasma temperature <lb/> T . Then v <lb/> 2  = k  B  T /m, where k  B  is the Boltzmann con-<lb/>stant. Consequently, the screening length in a hot plasma <lb/>reads as follows: <lb/> a <lb/> 2 <lb/> hp  = <lb/> k  B  T <lb/> 4πe  2  n <lb/> (8) <lb/>which corresponds to the Debye radius determining the <lb/>electron screening within the Debye-Hückel model. In this <lb/>sense, the velocity dependence of the screening length can <lb/>describe the transition between a weak electron screening <lb/>(hot plasmas) for v &gt; v  F  and the strong electron screening <lb/>(cold plasmas) for v &lt; v  F  . A corresponding formula has <lb/>been proposed by Lifschitz and Arista [21], <lb/>1 <lb/> a  2  (v) <lb/>= γ <lb/> 2v  F <lb/> π <lb/> 1 + <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> F  − v <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2v  F  v <lb/> ln <lb/> v + v  F <lb/> v − v  F <lb/> , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where γ is a number factor depending on the form of <lb/>the screening function Φ(r). For small v the expression in <lb/>parenthesis reaches the limit of 2 and the screening length <lb/>its minimum value (strong screening). <lb/>Since the deuteron energies, for which an enhancement <lb/>of the d + d reaction cross-sections due to the electron <lb/>screening can be observed, are smaller than the corre-<lb/>sponding deuteron Fermi energy (for Al E  F  (d) = 46 keV), <lb/> 0 <lb/> 2 0 <lb/>4 0 <lb/>6 0 <lb/>8 0 <lb/>1 0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/> Ta <lb/> Pd <lb/>Zr <lb/>Al <lb/>Be <lb/>C <lb/>Li <lb/> exp <lb/>theo <lb/> polarization <lb/>cohesion <lb/> Screening Energy (eV) <lb/> Atomic Number <lb/> Fig. 2.

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> Fig. 3. Comparison of experimental screening energies. Also depicted are the corresponding densities of the implanted deuterons. <lb/> we consider the experimentally determined screening en-<lb/>ergy independent of velocity. Thus, the experimental val-<lb/>ues of U  e  can be directly compared with the theoretical <lb/>ones according to the prescription <lb/> U  pol  = lim <lb/> r→0 <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/> − <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/>Φ (r) <lb/> . <lb/> (10) <lb/>The theoretical value for the total electron screening en-<lb/>ergy U  e  is a sum of the polarization and cohesion screening <lb/>energies U  pol  + U  coh  . The theoretical and experimental U  e <lb/> values determined for all target materials we have inves-<lb/>tigated are presented in fig. 2. <lb/>The theoretical calculations describe the observed ma-<lb/>terial dependence of the screening energy qualitatively <lb/>correctly. The main contribution to the theoretical val-<lb/>ues is provided by polarization of the free valence elec-<lb/>trons [13], although the contribution of bound electrons <lb/>(core polarization) cannot be neglected. In the case of <lb/>TaD, the resulting core polarization energy amounts to <lb/>about 1/3 of the valence electron screening energy. An in-<lb/>crease of U  e  with the atomic number arises mainly from <lb/>the cohesion contribution. However, the absolute values <lb/>of the theoretically calculated U  e  fail by a factor of about <lb/>two as compared to our experimental values. Including <lb/>the self-consistent correction and the full wave number <lb/>dependence of the dielectric function leads to screening en-<lb/>ergies lower than those determined within the simplified <lb/>theory [12]. No reason for such a large discrepancy be-<lb/>tween theoretical and experimental values has been found <lb/>so far. Even if a possible contribution of the channeling <lb/>effect to the experimentally determined U  e  values would <lb/>be taken into account —in the case of Ta much smaller <lb/>than 100 eV [22]— the difference between experiment and <lb/>theory remains large. <lb/> 4 Comparison with results of other authors <lb/> The screening energies measured by different groups to-<lb/>gether with the deuteron densities achieved in the experi-<lb/>ments are presented in fig. 3. The largest part of data was <lb/>obtained by the LUNA Collaboration (Bochum group) <lb/>which measured the screening energies for more than 50 <lb/>metals in three different experiments. Compared to our U  e <lb/> values that show only a weak material dependence and a <lb/>kind of saturation for heavier metals (Zr, Pd, Ta) with a <lb/>screening energy of about 300 eV, there are partially large <lb/>deviations. <lb/>The screening energy determined for Ta by the LUNA <lb/>Collaboration [8] (309±12 eV) and for Pd by the Japanese <lb/>group (Tohoku 1998 and 2002) [6,7] (310 ± 50 eV) are <lb/>very close to our values 302 ± 13 eV and 296 ± 15 eV, <lb/>respectively. On the other hand, the corresponding Pd <lb/></body>

			<body> value obtained by the LUNA Collaboration is much larger <lb/>amounting to 800 ± 90 eV [11]. For Zr the LUNA Collabo-<lb/>ration reported a significantly smaller U  e  value than ours, <lb/>whereas the values obtained for Al changed from a low <lb/>value in the first experiment to a large one in the third <lb/>experiment where the target surface was cleaned by Kr <lb/>sputtering immediately before the deuteron incidence. <lb/>The strong variation of the experimental screening en-<lb/>ergies for different metals, as depicted in fig. 3, contradicts <lb/>our results and cannot be explained within the proposed <lb/>theory. For some metals, the experimental screening ener-<lb/>gies are even smaller than theoretical ones. In order to ex-<lb/>plain this, an application of the Debye-Hückel model was <lb/>suggested [10,11,23]. The authors, setting room temper-<lb/>ature into the expression for the Debye screening length <lb/>(eq. (8)) and comparing with experimental U  e  values, ob-<lb/>tain charge carrier densities which are close to those de-<lb/>termined from experimental Hall constants. Consequently, <lb/>the experimental screening energies should be dependent <lb/>on temperature and proportional to the density of charge <lb/>carriers, i.e. electrons and holes. However, as shown in the <lb/>previous section, the Debye-Hückel screening is applicable <lb/>only for large temperature (k  B  T &gt; E  F  ) for which the elec-<lb/>tron degeneration vanishes and the Maxwell-Boltzmann <lb/>statistics can be used. For low temperatures (k  B  T &lt; E  F  ) <lb/>or correspondingly low projectile energies, the strong-<lb/>screening limit should be applied. According to eq. (9), <lb/>the screening length within this limit is smaller than the <lb/>Debye length at the temperature k  B  T = E  F  by a factor of <lb/> √ <lb/> 2. By the same factor the screening energy increases for <lb/>low velocities. Additionally, no temperature dependence <lb/>should be observed for the strong screening. Furthermore, <lb/>the dominant contribution to the screening effect, the va-<lb/>lence electron polarization, should only weakly depend on <lb/>the electron density, in accordance with the Fermi-Dirac <lb/>model U  F D  ∝ n <lb/> 1/6  (see fig. 2). <lb/>Thus, the strong variation of U  e  observed in some <lb/>experiments probably arises from experimental problems <lb/>with keeping constant a homogeneous deuteron density <lb/>in the metallic targets. Contrary to our experiments, the <lb/>large screening energies were measured using targets with <lb/>relatively low deuteron densities. This can cause a tem-<lb/>poral increase of the deuteron density in the surface re-<lb/>gion during the irradiation by projectile with lower ener-<lb/>gies and lead to an artificially large U  e  values. In turn, <lb/>too low screening energies can result from an oxidation <lb/>layer on the target surface. Since the deuteron density in <lb/>such a layer is much smaller than in the metallic bulk, the <lb/>increase of the cross-section at low beam energy should <lb/>be reduced [24]. Even cleaning of the target surface by <lb/>a sputtering gun cannot help much under high-vacuum <lb/>conditions, since in a vacuum of order 10 <lb/> −8  mbar the tar-<lb/>gets can re-oxidize within a few minutes (see, for exam-<lb/>ple, [25]). This effect depends very strongly on the chem-<lb/>ical reactivity of the target material and can be, on the <lb/>other hand, reduced by the sputtering process of the target <lb/>surface during the deuteron irradiation, which is, however, <lb/>also target material dependent. Thus, the small value of <lb/> U  e  for some metals being significantly smaller than both <lb/>our experimental and theoretical values, might be due to <lb/>the re-oxidation process of the target. For a further de-<lb/>tailed discussion of experimental results, we refer to our <lb/>forthcoming paper [26]. <lb/> 5 Discussion and conclusions <lb/> In contradiction to results of the LUNA Collaboration, our <lb/>experimental screening energies show only a weak target <lb/>material dependence. As already stated above, discrepan-<lb/>cies probably arise from an inhomogeneous depth distribu-<lb/>tion of deuterons within the irradiated targets. The situa-<lb/>tion can certainly be improved in the future experiments <lb/>performed under ultra-high–vacuum conditions with an <lb/>on-line monitoring of the deuteron density. <lb/>Clearly, the target material dependence of the screen-<lb/>ing energy is very important for the theoretical description <lb/>of the effect. The improved dielectric function theory pre-<lb/>sented here supports a weak target material dependence <lb/>of the screening energy. The theory provides, however, ab-<lb/>solute values being by a factor of 2 smaller than the ex-<lb/>perimental ones. Therefore, one of the aims of future ex-<lb/>periments remains to prove which screening contribution <lb/>—valence electron polarization, core electron polarization <lb/>or cohesion screening— is enhanced in the deuterized met-<lb/>als. Such a test is also very interesting for the physics <lb/>of dense astrophysical plasmas. A large advantage of the <lb/>presented theoretical approach is its ability to determine <lb/>the deuteron-deuteron potential also for large distances <lb/>(fig. 1). This enables to calculate the effective screening <lb/>energies down to room temperature and consequently to <lb/>compare the experimental results at higher energies with <lb/>those achieved in the cold-fusion experiments by means of <lb/>the heavy-water electrolysis. As shown in [13], the screen-<lb/>ing energy of order 300 eV determined in accelerator ex-<lb/>periments can explain the neutron production rate ob-<lb/>served by Jones et al. [27] at room temperature. Much <lb/>larger U  e  values of order 750 eV obtained in some acceler-<lb/>ator experiments would increase the neutron production <lb/>rate at room temperature by a factor of 10 <lb/> 7  , which is, <lb/>however, not observed. <lb/>The method proposed to include the velocity depen-<lb/>dence for the dynamic screening allows to demonstrate the <lb/>transition from the weak-to the strong-screening regime. <lb/>Since the electron screening effect in the nuclear reactions <lb/>is observable only at very low projectile energies, the the-<lb/>oretical description in the frame of the adiabatic dielec-<lb/>tric function theory is well founded. On the contrary, the <lb/>model based on the Debye-Hückel theory is for low tem-<lb/>peratures and projectile velocities below the Fermi veloc-<lb/>ity not applicable. <lb/></body>

We study the effect of screening by bound electrons in low energy nuclear reactions. We use <lb/>molecular dynamics to simulate the reactions involving many electrons: D+d, D+D, <lb/> 3  He+d, <lb/> 3  He+D, <lb/> 6  Li+d, <lb/> 6  Li+D, <lb/> 7  Li+p, <lb/> 7  Li+H. Quantum effects corresponding to the Pauli and Heisenberg principles are enforced <lb/>by constraints in terms of the phase space occupancy. In addition to the well-known adiabatic and sudden <lb/>limits, we propose a new &quot; dissipative limit &quot; which is expected to be important not only at high energies <lb/>but in the extremely low energy region. The dissipative limit is associated with the chaotic behavior of <lb/>the electronic motion. It affects also the magnitude of the enhancement factor. We discuss also numerical <lb/>experiments using polarized targets. The derived enhancement factors in our simulation are in agreement <lb/>with those extracted within the R-matrix approach. <lb/> PACS. 25.45.-z <lb/> 2  H-induced reactions – 34.10.+x General theories and models of atomic and molecular <lb/>collisions and interactions (including statistical theories, transition state, stochastic and trajectory models, <lb/>etc.) <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The relation between the tunneling process and dynam-<lb/>ical chaos has been discussed with great interests in re-<lb/>cent years [1,2]. Though the tunneling is a completely <lb/>quantum-mechanical phenomenon, it is influenced by clas-<lb/>sical chaos. In the sense that the chaos causes the fluctua-<lb/>tion of the classical action which essentially determines the <lb/>tunneling probability. We study the phenomenon by ex-<lb/>amining the screening effect by bound electrons in the low <lb/>energy fusion reaction. In the low energy region the exper-<lb/>imental cross-sections with gas targets show an increasing <lb/>enhancement with decreasing bombarding energy with re-<lb/>spect to the values obtained by extrapolating from the <lb/>data at high energies [3]. Many studies attempted to at-<lb/>tribute the enhancement of the reaction rate to the screen-<lb/>ing effects by bound target electrons. In this context one <lb/>often estimates the screening potential as a constant de-<lb/>crease of the barrier height in the tunneling region through <lb/>a fit to the data. A puzzle has been that the screening po-<lb/>tential obtained by this procedure exceeds the value of the <lb/>so-called adiabatic limit, which is given by the difference <lb/>of the binding energies of the united atoms and of the <lb/>target atom and it is theoretically thought to provide the <lb/>maximum screening potential [4].

			<note place="footnote"> a  e-mail: kimura@lns.infn.it <lb/> determination of the bare cross-sections has been proposed <lb/>theoretically [5] and experimentally [6], using the Tro-<lb/>jan Horse method [7,8,9]. The comparison between newly <lb/>obtained bare cross-sections, i.e., astrophysical S-factors, <lb/> and the cross-sections by the direct measurements gives <lb/>a variety of values for the screening potential. These val-<lb/>ues are often smaller than the sudden limit or larger than <lb/>the adiabatic limit. Theoretical studies performed using <lb/>the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) scheme [10,11] <lb/>suggest that the screening potential is between the sudden <lb/>and the adiabatic limits. <lb/>One of the aims of this paper is to try to assess the <lb/>effect of the screening quantitatively. Up to now, the dy-<lb/>namical effects of bound electrons have been studied only <lb/>in some limited cases with a few bound electrons (the <lb/>D+d with atomic target [10,11] and molecular D  2  tar-<lb/>get [12], the <lb/> 3  He+d [10]) with the TDHF method. We in-<lb/>vestigate here the dynamical effects, including the tunnel-<lb/>ing region, for other systems with many bound electrons: <lb/>D+D, <lb/> 3  He+D, observing the effect of the electron capture <lb/>of projectile. We consider also some reactions including Li <lb/>isotopes: <lb/> 6  Li+d, <lb/> 6  Li+D, <lb/> 7  Li+p and <lb/> 7  Li+H. <lb/>To simulate the effects of many electrons, we use the <lb/>constrained molecular dynamics (CoMD) model [2,13,14]. <lb/>At very low energies fluctuations are anticipated to play a <lb/>substantial role.

Such <lb/>a limitation is not necessarily true in nature and the mean <lb/>field dynamics could be not correct especially in the pres-<lb/>ence of large fluctuations. Molecular dynamics contains <lb/>all possible correlations and fluctuations due to the initial <lb/>conditions (events). For the purpose of treating quantum-<lb/>mechanical systems like target atoms and molecules, we <lb/>use classical equations of motion with constraints to sat-<lb/>isfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the Pauli <lb/>exclusion principle for each event [13]. In extending the <lb/>study to the lower incident energies, we would like to stress <lb/>the connection between the motion of bound electrons and <lb/>chaos. In fact, depending on the dynamics, the behavior of <lb/>the electron(s) is unstable and influences the relative mo-<lb/>tion of the projectile and the target. The feature is caused <lb/>by the non-integrability of the N -body system (N ≥ 3) <lb/>and it is well known that the tunneling probability can <lb/>be modified by the existence of chaotic environment. We <lb/>discuss the enhancement factor of the laboratory cross-<lb/>section in connection with the integrability of the system <lb/>by looking the inter-nuclear and electronic oscillational <lb/>motion. More specifically we analyze the frequency shift <lb/>of the target electron due to the projectile and the small <lb/>oscillational motion induced by the electron to the rel-<lb/>ative motion between the target and the projectile. We <lb/>show that the increase of chaoticity in the electron mo-<lb/>tion decreases the fusion probability. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows. In sect. 2 we intro-<lb/>duce the enhancement factor f  e  and describe the essence <lb/>of the constrained molecular dynamics approach briefly. In <lb/>sect. 3 we apply it to assess the effect of the bound elec-<lb/>trons during the nuclear reactions. We discuss also the <lb/>relation between the amplitudes of the inter-nuclear oscil-<lb/>lational motion and the enhancement factor. We summa-<lb/>rize the paper in sect. 4. <lb/> 2 Formalism <lb/> 2.1 Enhancement factor <lb/> We denote the reaction cross-section at incident energy <lb/>in the center of mass E by σ(E) and the cross-section <lb/>obtained in the absence of electrons by σ  0  (E). The en-<lb/>hancement factor f  e  is defined as <lb/> f  e  ≡ <lb/> σ(E) <lb/>σ  0  (E) <lb/> . <lb/> (1) <lb/>If the effect of the electrons is well represented by the <lb/>constant shift U  e  of the potential barrier, following [15, <lb/>10], (U  e  E): <lb/>f  e  ∼ exp <lb/> πη(E) <lb/>U  e <lb/> E <lb/> , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where η(E) is the Sommerfeld parameter [16]. <lb/> 2.2 Constrained molecular dynamics <lb/> We estimate the enhancement factor f  e  numerically using <lb/>molecular dynamics approach: <lb/>dr  i <lb/> dt <lb/>= <lb/> p  i  c <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  i <lb/> , <lb/> dp  i <lb/> dt <lb/>= −∇  r  U (r  i  ), <lb/>(3) <lb/>where (r  i  , p  i  ) are the position, momentum of the particle <lb/> i at time t. E  i  = <lb/> p  2 <lb/> i  c  2  + m  2 <lb/> i  c  4  , U (r  i  ) and m  i  are its en-<lb/>ergy, Coulomb potential and mass, respectively. We set the <lb/>starting point of the reaction at 10Å inter-nuclear separa-<lb/>tion. In eqs. (3) we do not take into account the quantum <lb/>effect of Pauli exclusion principle and Heisenberg princi-<lb/>ple. In order to take the feature of the Pauli blocking into <lb/>account in this framework, we use the Lagrange multiplier <lb/>method for constraints and modify the classical equations <lb/>of motion (3). <lb/>Our constraint which corresponds to the Pauli block-<lb/>ing is ¯ <lb/> f  i  ≤ 1 in terms of phase space density; note that <lb/>the phase space density can be directly related to the dis-<lb/>tance of two particles, i.e., r  ij  p  ij  , in the phase space. Here <lb/> r  ij  = |r  i  −r  j  | and p  ij  = |p  i  −p  j  |. The relation ¯ <lb/> f  i  ≤ 1 is ful-<lb/>filled, if r  ij  p  ij  ≥ ξ  P  ¯ hδ  Si,Sj  , where ξ  P  = 2π(3/4π) <lb/> 2/3  . i, j <lb/> refer only to electrons and S  i  , S  j  (= ±1/2) are their spin <lb/>projection. For the Heisenberg principle r  ij  p  ij  ≥ ξ  H  ¯ h, <lb/> where ξ  H  = 1, i and j refer not only to electrons but <lb/>also to the nucleus. ξ  H  is determined to reproduce the <lb/>correct energy of hydrogenic atoms. Obviously the condi-<lb/>tions r  ij  p  ij  = ξ  H(P )  ¯ h must be fulfilled in the ground-state <lb/>configuration rather than r  ij  p  ij  &gt; ξ  H(P )  ¯ h. <lb/> Using these constraints, the Lagrangian of the system <lb/>can be written down as <lb/> L = <lb/> i <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> i  c <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  i <lb/> − <lb/> i,j( =i) <lb/> U (r  ij  ) + <lb/> i,j( =i) <lb/> λ <lb/> H <lb/>i <lb/>  r  ij  p  ij <lb/> ¯ h <lb/> − 1 <lb/> + <lb/> i,j( =i) <lb/> λ <lb/> P <lb/>i <lb/>  r  ij  p  ij <lb/> ξ  P  ¯ h <lb/>δ  Si,Sj  − 1 <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where λ <lb/> P <lb/>i  and λ <lb/> H <lb/>i  are Lagrange multipliers. The varia-<lb/>tional calculus leads to <lb/>dr  i <lb/> dt <lb/>= <lb/> p  i  c <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  i <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>¯ h <lb/> j( =i) <lb/> λ <lb/> H <lb/>i <lb/> ξ  H <lb/> + <lb/> λ <lb/> P <lb/>i <lb/> ξ  P <lb/> δ  Si,Sj <lb/> r  ij <lb/> ∂p  ij <lb/> ∂p  i <lb/> , <lb/> (5) <lb/>dp  i <lb/> dt <lb/>=−∇  r  U (r  i  ) − <lb/> 1 <lb/>¯ h <lb/> j( =i) <lb/> λ <lb/> H <lb/>i <lb/> ξ  H <lb/> + <lb/> λ <lb/> P <lb/>i <lb/> ξ  P <lb/> δ  Si,Sj <lb/> p  ij <lb/> ∂r  ij <lb/> ∂r  i <lb/> . (6) <lb/>In order to obtain the atomic ground-state configuration, <lb/>we perform the time integration of eqs. (5) and (6). The <lb/>value of λ <lb/> H <lb/>i  and λ <lb/> P <lb/>i  are determined depending on the mag-<lb/>nitude of r  ij  p  ij  . If r  ij  p  ij  is (smaller) larger than ξ  H(P )  ¯ h, <lb/>λ has positive (negative) sign. Thus we change the phase <lb/>space occupancy of the system. The constraints restrict <lb/>us to variations ΔL = 0 that keep the constraints always <lb/>true [14]. In this way we obtain many initial conditions <lb/>which occupy different points in the phase space micro-<lb/>scopically. <lb/> S. Kimura et al.: Influence of chaos on the fusion enhancement by electron screening <lb/>91 <lb/> In order to treat the tunneling process, we define the <lb/>collective coordinates R <lb/> coll  and the collective momentum <lb/> P <lb/> coll  as <lb/> R <lb/> coll <lb/> ≡ r  P  − r  T  , <lb/> P <lb/> coll <lb/> ≡ p  P  − p  T  , <lb/> (7) <lb/>where r  T  , r  P  (p  T  , p  P  ) are the coordinates (momenta) of <lb/>the target and the projectile nuclei, respectively. When <lb/>the collective momentum becomes zero, we switch on the <lb/>collective force, which is determined by F <lb/> coll <lb/>P <lb/> ≡ ˙ <lb/> P <lb/> coll  and <lb/> F <lb/> coll <lb/>T <lb/> ≡ − ˙ <lb/> P <lb/> coll  , to enter into imaginary time [17]. We fol-<lb/>low the time evolution in the tunneling region using the <lb/>equations <lb/>dr <lb/> T (P ) <lb/> dτ <lb/>= <lb/> p <lb/> T (P ) <lb/> E  T (P ) <lb/> , <lb/>dp <lb/> T (P ) <lb/> dτ <lb/> = −∇  r  U (r <lb/> T (P )  ) − 2F <lb/> coll <lb/>T (P )  , <lb/> (8) <lb/>where τ is used for imaginary time to be distinguished <lb/>from real time t. r <lb/> T (P )  and p <lb/> T (P )  are position and mo-<lb/>mentum of the target (the projectile) during the tunnel-<lb/>ing process, respectively. Adding the collective force cor-<lb/>responds to inverting the potential barrier which becomes <lb/>attractive in the imaginary times. The penetrability of the <lb/>barrier is given by [17] <lb/> Π(E) = (1 + exp (2A(E)/¯ h)) <lb/> −1  , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where the action integral A(E) is <lb/> A(E) = <lb/>  ra <lb/>r  b <lb/> P <lb/> coll  dR <lb/> coll  , <lb/> (10) <lb/> r  a  and r  b  are the classical turning points. The internal <lb/>classical turning point r  b  is determined using the sum of <lb/>the radii of the target and projectile nuclei. Similarly from <lb/>the simulation without electron, we obtain the penetrabil-<lb/>ity of the bare Coulomb barrier Π  0  (E). <lb/>Since nuclear reactions occur with small impact pa-<lb/>rameters on the atomic scale, we consider only head-on <lb/>collisions. The enhancement factor is thus given by eq. (1), <lb/> f  e  = Π(E)/Π  0  (E) <lb/>(11) <lb/>for each event in our simulation. Thus we have an ensemble <lb/>of f  e  values at each incident energy. <lb/> 3 Application to the electron screening <lb/>problem <lb/> 3.1 D+d and D+D reactions <lb/> Figure 1 shows the incident energy dependence of the en-<lb/>hancement factor for the reactions D+d and D+D, where <lb/>the systems involve 1 and 2 electrons, respectively.

For the reaction D+d f <lb/> (AD) <lb/> e <lb/> is <lb/>obtained by assuming equally weighted linear combination <lb/>of the lowest-energy gerade and ungerade wave function <lb/>for the electron, reflecting the symmetry in the D+d, i.e., <lb/> f <lb/> (AD) <lb/> e <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> e <lb/> πη(E) <lb/> U <lb/> (g) <lb/> e <lb/>E <lb/> + e <lb/> πη(E) <lb/> U <lb/> (u) <lb/> e <lb/>E <lb/> , <lb/> (12) <lb/>where U <lb/> (g) <lb/> e <lb/> = 40.7 eV and U <lb/> (u) <lb/> e <lb/> = 0.0 eV [11,10]. If we take <lb/>into account the electron capture of the projectile, i.e., in <lb/>the case of D+D, the enhancement factor in the adiabatic <lb/>limit is <lb/> f <lb/> (AD) <lb/> e <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> e <lb/> πη(E) <lb/> U <lb/> (g.s.) <lb/> e <lb/>E <lb/> + <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/> e <lb/> πη(E) <lb/> U <lb/> (1es) <lb/> e <lb/>E <lb/> , <lb/> (13) <lb/>where U <lb/> (g.s.) <lb/> e <lb/> = 51.7 eV and U <lb/> (1es) <lb/> e <lb/> = 31.9 eV [18]. The <lb/>solid curve and dashed curve show the enhancement fac-<lb/>tors in the dissipative limit f <lb/> (DL) <lb/> e <lb/> for the reactions D+d <lb/>and D+D, respectively. Notice how the calculated en-<lb/>hancement factor with their variances nicely ends up be-<lb/>tween the adiabatic and the dissipative limits. We per-<lb/>formed also a fit of our data using eq. (2) including the <lb/>very low energy region and obtained U  e  = 15.9 ± 2.0 eV <lb/>for D+d case and U  e  = 21.6 ± 0.3 eV for D+D. <lb/>Now we look at the oscillational motions of the parti-<lb/>cle&apos;s coordinates as the projection on the z-axis (the re-<lb/>action axis). We denote the z-component of r  T  , r  P  and <lb/> r  e  as z  T  , z  P  and z  e  , respectively. Practically, we examine <lb/>the oscillational motion of the electron around the tar-<lb/>get, z  T e  = z  e  − z  T  , and the oscillational motion of the <lb/>inter-nuclear motion, i.e., the motion between the target <lb/>and the projectile, z  s  = z  T  + z  P  , which essentially would <lb/>be zero due to the symmetry of the system in the ab-<lb/>sence of the perturbation. In fig. 2 these two values are <lb/>shown for 2 events, which have the enhancement factor <lb/> f  e  = 170.8 (ev. A), and f  e  = 6.5 (ev. B), at the inci-<lb/>dent energy E  cm  = 0.15 keV.

Incident energy dependence of the enhancement factor <lb/>for P  ⊥  and P   targets. <lb/> which the system reaches the classical turning point. It is <lb/>clear that in the case of event B the orbit of the electron is <lb/>much distorted from the unperturbed one than in event A. <lb/>Characteristics of z  s  are that 1) its value often becomes <lb/>zero, as is expected in the unperturbed system, and 2) the <lb/>component of the deviation from zero shows a periodical <lb/>behavior. It is remarkable that the amplitude of the de-<lb/>viation becomes quite large at some points in the case of <lb/>event B which shows the small enhancement factor. Note <lb/>that in event B one observes clear beats, i.e., resonances. <lb/>Thus for two events, with the same macroscopic initial <lb/>conditions, we have a completely different outcome, which <lb/>is a definite proof of chaos in our 3-body system. We can <lb/>understand these results in first approximation by consid-<lb/>ering the motion of the ions to be much slower than the <lb/>rapidly oscillating motion of the electrons [2]. From fig. 2 <lb/>we can deduce the following important fact. If the motion <lb/>of the electron is initially in the plane perpendicular to the <lb/>reaction axis, the enhancement factor is large, event A (no-<lb/>tice |z  T e  | | R  B  , i.e., the Bohr radius, at t ∼ 0). On the <lb/>other hand, if there is a substantial projection of the elec-<lb/>tron motion, as in event B (the amplitude of |z  T e  | ∼ R  B <lb/> at t ∼ 0), on the reaction axis the enhancement factor is <lb/>relatively small because of the increase of chaoticity. The <lb/>fact suggests that if one performs experiments at very low <lb/>bombarding energies with polarized targets, the enhance-<lb/>ment factor can be controlled by changing the polarization. <lb/> The largest enhancement would be gained with targets po-<lb/>larized perpendicularly to the beam axis. <lb/>In order to test this estimation, we prepared ensem-<lb/>bles of target atoms which are polarized perpendicular <lb/>(P  ⊥  ) and parallel (P   ) to the beam axis, numerically. In <lb/>fig. 3 we show the incident energy dependence of the av-<lb/>erage enhancement factor for the P  ⊥  and P   targets with <lb/>pluses and crosses, particularly in the low energy region. <lb/>The enhancement factors from the P  ⊥  targets are always <lb/>larger than that from the P   targets. In contrast to the av-<lb/>erage enhancement from the P  ⊥  targets, which increases <lb/>monotonically as the incident energy becomes smaller, the <lb/>average enhancement from the P   targets fluctuates. It has <lb/>also large variances at low energies. A remarkable thing <lb/>is that with the parallel targets there are many events <lb/>in which the enhancement factor becomes less than 1. It <lb/>means that in this case the bound electron gives the effect <lb/>of hindrance to the tunneling probability. <lb/> 3.2 <lb/></body>

[22]. They used LiF solid tar-<lb/>gets and hydrogen projectiles as well as hydrogen molec-<lb/>ular gas targets and Li projectiles.

Again the average <lb/>enhancement factors of the reaction <lb/> 6  Li+D ( <lb/> 7  Li+H) are <lb/>larger than those of the <lb/> 6  Li+d ( <lb/> 7  Li+p). The enhancement <lb/>factors of the reaction <lb/> 6  Li+D are in agreement with the <lb/>extracted values using the R-matrix approach within the <lb/>variances over all the events. The fit of the obtained aver-<lb/>age enhancement factors suggests the screening potentials <lb/> U  e  = 152.0 ± 9.9 eV for <lb/> 6  Li+d and U  e  = 214.4 ± 18.5 for <lb/> 6  Li+D. The screening potential for the reaction <lb/> 6  Li+d in <lb/>our simulation does not exceed the adiabatic limit nor the <lb/>extracted values using the R-matrix theory and the THM, <lb/>but that for <lb/> 6  Li+D verges to the extracted values using <lb/>the R-matrix approach. <lb/> 4 Summary <lb/> We discussed the effect of the screening by the electrons <lb/>in nuclear reactions at the astrophysical energies. We per-<lb/>formed molecular dynamics simulations with constraints <lb/>and imaginary time for the reactions D+d, D+D, <lb/> 3  He+d, <lb/> 3  He+D, <lb/> 6  Li+d, <lb/> 6  Li+D, <lb/> 7  Li+p, <lb/> 7  Li+H. For all the reac-<lb/>tions it is shown that both the average enhancement fac-<lb/>tors and their variances increase as the incident energy <lb/>becomes lower. Using bare projectiles we obtained the av-<lb/>erage screening potential smaller than the value in the <lb/>adiabatic limit for all reactions. This is because of the ex-<lb/>citation or emission of several bound electrons during the <lb/>reactions. The comparison between the bare and atomic <lb/>projectile cases for each reaction revealed that the electron <lb/>capture of the projectile leads to larger enhancements. <lb/>The derived enhancement factors in our simulation are <lb/>in agreement with those extracted within the R-matrix <lb/> approach including the variances over all the events. <lb/>We report also the results of the numerical experi-<lb/>ments using polarized targets for the reaction D+d. Using <lb/>P  ⊥  targets, we obtained relatively large enhancements <lb/>with small variances. While P   targets give large variances <lb/>of the enhancement factors and relatively small averaged <lb/>enhancement factors. This is because with the P   targets <lb/>the force exerted from the electron to the relative motion <lb/>of the nuclei is oscillational, in the direction of the beam <lb/>axis, and the motion of the electron becomes often ex-<lb/>cited or unstable. It is the case where the chaoticity of <lb/>the electron motion affects the tunneling probability and <lb/>at the same time the enhancement factor of the cross-<lb/>section. This suggests that if one performs experiments <lb/>at very low bombarding energies with polarized targets, <lb/>the enhancement factor can be controlled by changing the <lb/>polarization. The largest enhancement will be obtained <lb/>in reactions with targets polarized perpendicularly to the <lb/>beam direction. <lb/></body>

The availability of exotic beams has produced great opportunities for advances in our under-<lb/>standing of the nucleosynthesis occurring in stellar burning and stellar explosions such as novae, X-ray <lb/>bursts, and supernovae. In these extreme environments, synthesized radioactive nuclei can undergo sub-<lb/>sequent nuclear processing before they decay, and thus to understand these events, we must understand <lb/>reaction rates involving radioactive nuclei. At the ORNL Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF), <lb/>we have made a number of measurements using proton-rich beams such as <lb/> 18  F and <lb/> 7  Be and neutron-rich <lb/>beams such as <lb/> 82  Ge and <lb/> 84  Se that help clarify the structure of astrophysically-important nuclei. We are <lb/>also poised to begin studies with doubly-magic <lb/> 132  Sn. The experimental methods and results are discussed. <lb/> PACS. 25.60.-t Reactions induced by unstable nuclei – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae <lb/>and other explosive environments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Nuclear astrophysics addresses some of the most com-<lb/>pelling questions in nature: What are the origins of the <lb/>elements that make life on earth possible? How did the <lb/>sun, the solar system, the stars, and our galaxy form, and <lb/>how did they evolve? What is the total density of matter <lb/>in the universe, and will the universe eventually collapse or <lb/>expand forever? Astrophysical models that address these <lb/>crucial questions require a considerable amount of nu-<lb/>clear physics information as input. The majority of this <lb/>required information, however, is currently based on ex-<lb/>trapolations or theoretical models and does not have a <lb/>firm experimental basis. Nuclear data is also an impor-<lb/>tant ingredient in the interpretation of new observations <lb/>made by ground-based observatories such as the Keck and <lb/>European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Tele-<lb/>scopes, by space-borne observatories such as the Hubble <lb/>Space Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and <lb/>by large subterranean detectors such as the Sudbury Neu-<lb/>trino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. More complete <lb/>and precise nuclear physics measurements are therefore <lb/>needed to improve astrophysical models and to decipher <lb/>the latest observations [1]. <lb/>Because radioactive nuclei play an influential, and <lb/>in some cases the dominant, role in many cosmic phe-<lb/>nomena, information on these nuclei is particularly im-<lb/>portant to improve our understanding of the processes <lb/>that shape our universe.

To understand and interpret observations <lb/>of these events we must understand the nuclear reactions, <lb/>the nuclear structure, and the decay mechanisms for un-<lb/>stable nuclei.

			<body> radioactive beams and 79 beams of stable species [3]. <lb/>Available radioactive beams include proton-rich species <lb/>such as <lb/> 7  Be and <lb/> 17,18  F and neutron-rich beams such as <lb/> 82  Ge and doubly-magic <lb/> 132  Sn. Energies up to ∼ 10 MeV/u <lb/>are possible for low mass beams and up to ∼ 5 MeV/u for <lb/>beams near <lb/> 132  Sn. <lb/>While the availability of radioactive beams provides <lb/>great opportunities for the better understanding of nu-<lb/>clei and nuclear reactions far from stability, there are <lb/>also great challenges that must be overcome to utilize <lb/>such beams. Radioactive beams are generally available <lb/>only at a much lower intensity than stable beams (∼ <lb/>10 <lb/> 4−7  ions/s compared to 10 <lb/> 9−12  ions/s for stable beams). <lb/>High-efficiency large solid-angle detector arrays have been <lb/>developed to deal with low beam intensity measurements. <lb/>The Silicon Detector Array (SIDAR) [4] is a segmented <lb/>array of silicon strip detectors that has been used for <lb/>several of the nuclear astrophysics measurements at the <lb/>HRIBF. Other detector arrays available at the HRIBF <lb/>include the CLARION array of Clover germanium detec-<lb/>tors and the HYBALL array of CsI detectors [5]. Another <lb/>challenge is that radioactive beams are frequently con-<lb/>taminated with an unwanted isobar. While this contami-<lb/>nant can sometimes be removed with chemical techniques <lb/>at the ion source or by fully stripping the beam (usually <lb/>with accompanying drops in intensity), a general solution <lb/>does not exist and many times an isobarically mixed beam <lb/>will be delivered to the experimenter. A detector system <lb/>with high selectivity is many times the best solution to <lb/>the problem. Kinematically-complete measurements uti-<lb/>lizing coincidence techniques is one method to identify the <lb/>events of interest in such cases. We have frequently de-<lb/>tected the beam-like recoil from a reaction in a gas-filled <lb/>ionization counter, identifying the proton number (Z) of <lb/>the recoil, and thus determining the reaction channel. Be-<lb/>cause the measurements of astrophysical interest are usu-<lb/>ally performed in inverse kinematics, the beam-like recoils <lb/>are forward focused and can be efficiently detected in an <lb/>ionization counter covering relatively small laboratory an-<lb/>gles (&lt; 10 <lb/> •  ). <lb/>While direct measurements of the reaction of interest <lb/>are extremely important, it is not generally possible (or <lb/>even desirable) to measure the reaction cross-section at <lb/>all of the energies required to completely determine the <lb/>stellar reaction rate. It is crucial to have complimentary <lb/>measurements which may not directly determine the re-<lb/>action rate but do help to elucidate the structure of the <lb/>compound nuclear system involved. A good understanding <lb/>of the properties of states in the compound nuclei can be <lb/>used to calculate the stellar reaction rate over a large range <lb/>of astrophysical temperatures. Direct measurements of re-<lb/>action cross-sections should thus be complimented with <lb/>other studies such as single-nucleon transfer reactions pop-<lb/>ulating states of interest or particle-decay branching ratio <lb/>studies from stable beam measurements. These points are <lb/>discussed further in the following sections describing our <lb/>studies with <lb/> 18  F beams (sect. 3), <lb/> 7  Be beams (sect. 4), and <lb/>neutron-rich beams (sect. 5). <lb/> 18  F <lb/> 18 F <lb/>p <lb/> α <lb/> 15 O <lb/> SIDAR <lb/>SIDAR <lb/>Target Chamber <lb/>Window <lb/>Cathode <lb/>Anodes <lb/>Gas Ionization Counter <lb/> Fig. 1. Our experimental configuration is shown with the <lb/> 18  F ions impinging on a polypropylene target. For the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F measurement, scattered protons were detected <lb/>in the SIDAR array in coincidence with recoil <lb/> 18  F ions detected <lb/>by the ionization counter. For the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O measurement, <lb/>both the recoil <lb/> 15  O ions and α particles were detected in coin-<lb/>cidence in the SIDAR. <lb/> 3 Studies with <lb/> 18 F beams <lb/> Beams of <lb/> 18  F have been used to study <lb/> 18  F production in <lb/>novae. <lb/> 18  F is relatively long-lived (t  1/2  = 1.8 h) and pro-<lb/>duced in large amounts in novae. It is therefore a target for <lb/> γ-ray astronomy, and its observation in novae would pro-<lb/>vide a rather direct test of nova models [6]. To interpret <lb/>observations such as these, however, we must know the <lb/>rates of thermonuclear reactions that affect <lb/> 18  F produc-<lb/>tion. The <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction is one of the most impor-<lb/>tant reactions to understand as it destroys <lb/> 18  F in the nova <lb/>environment but is also one of the most uncertain [7]. We <lb/>have made several measurements at the HRIBF to better <lb/>determine the <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction rate in novae. <lb/> 18  F beams were produced by bombarding a fi-<lb/>brous HfO  2  target with an 85 MeV <lb/> 4  He beam. The <lb/> 16  O(α, pn) <lb/> 18  F reaction produced <lb/> 18  F atoms which were <lb/>subsequently ionized, extracted, and accelerated by the <lb/>HRIBF tandem electrostatic accelerator. Typical beam <lb/>currents were 2 × 10 <lb/> 5 18  F/s with an <lb/> 18  O contamination <lb/>at a ratio of <lb/> 18  O/ <lb/> 18  F ∼ 8/1. This <lb/> 18  O contamination can <lb/>be removed by stripping the beam to q = 9 <lb/> +  before the <lb/>energy-analyzing magnet with some loss in <lb/> 18  F beam in-<lb/>tensity depending on the energy of the beam. <lb/>Our first measurement [8] was of the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F <lb/>elastic-scattering cross-section as a function of energy. A <lb/> 18  F beam was used to bombard a hydrogen-containing <lb/>(CH  2  )  n  target and elastically-scattered protons were de-<lb/>tected by the Silicon Detector Array (SIDAR) [4]. Beam-<lb/>like recoils were detected and identified in coincidence at <lb/>forward angles in an isobutane-filled gas ionization counter <lb/>(see fig. 1). This coincidence requirement was necessary to <lb/>discriminate protons scattered by <lb/> 18  F from protons scat-<lb/>tered by <lb/> 18  O. The <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F events were then counted <lb/>as a function of beam energy to produce the excitation <lb/>function shown in fig. 2. This study resolved significant un-<lb/>certainties from previous discrepant measurements [9,10] <lb/>concerning the width and energy for an important 3/2 <lb/> + <lb/> resonance at E  c.m.  = 665 keV. <lb/>This measurement has now been extended to a broader <lb/>energy range (0.3–1.3 MeV) [11] using the thick-target <lb/>technique [12].

The beam had been <lb/>fully stripped to remove the <lb/> 18  O contamination. Scat-<lb/>tered protons from the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F reaction were de-<lb/>tected at θ  lab  = 8 <lb/> •  –16 <lb/> •  by a double-sided silicon strip <lb/>detector (DSSD). Because the scattered protons lose rel-<lb/>atively little energy in the target, measurements of the <lb/>proton&apos;s energy and angle of scatter were sufficient to de-<lb/>termine the center-of-mass energy at which the reaction <lb/>occurred [12]. A measurement of the scattered proton en-<lb/>ergy spectrum at a fixed angle can thus be used to ex-<lb/>tract the excitation function for the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F reac-<lb/>tion over a wide range of center-of-mass energies. Using <lb/>this technique, we measured the excitation function shown <lb/> Fig. 4. The α particle energy is plotted vs. the heavy re-<lb/>coil energy. Owing to the different Q-values for the reactions, <lb/>the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O events are readily distinguished from the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  O, α) <lb/> 15  N events. <lb/> in fig. 3. The previously-observed resonance at E  c.m.  = <lb/>0.665 MeV was clearly evident along with a new resonance <lb/>at E  c.m.  = 1.01 MeV. From an R-matrix fit to the data, <lb/>we determined the most-likely properties of the latter to <lb/>be J <lb/> π  = 7/2 <lb/> +  , E  x  = 7.420 ± 0.014 MeV, Γ  p  = 27 ± 4 keV, <lb/>and Γ  α  = 71 ± 11 keV. Possibly more important for no-<lb/>vae temperatures, we were able to set upper limits on the <lb/>proton widths of unobserved resonances, several of which <lb/>are expected based upon comparisons with the mirror nu-<lb/>cleus, <lb/> 19  F. Because the proton widths are typically much <lb/>smaller than the alpha widths for <lb/> 19  Ne energy levels near <lb/>the proton threshold (E  x  = 6.411 MeV), these upper lim-<lb/>its directly constrain the resonance strengths and thus the <lb/>contributions these unobserved levels could possibly make <lb/>to the <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O rate. <lb/>In addition to the elastic-scattering measurements, we <lb/>have also measured the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O cross-section di-<lb/>rectly for astrophysically-important resonances at E  c.m.  = <lb/>330 and 665 keV. The 665 keV measurement was made <lb/>simultaneously with the elastic-scattering measurement <lb/>discussed above [14]. In this case, α particles and <lb/> 15  O <lb/>recoils were both detected in coincidence in the SIDAR <lb/>array. The events of interest were identified by plotting <lb/>(fig. 4) the detected α energy vs. the heavy recoil en-<lb/>ergy. Reactions for which both outgoing particles were de-<lb/>tected appear as lines of constant total energy in fig. 4. <lb/>Owing to the different Q values for the reactions, the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O events were readily distinguished from the <lb/>more intense <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  O, α) <lb/> 15  N events. By counting the num-<lb/>ber of <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O events observed as a function of bom-<lb/>barding energy, the excitation function plotted in fig. 2(b) <lb/>was produced. A simultaneous fit to the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 18  F and <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O data sets yielded a precise value of the res-<lb/>onance strength, ωγ = 6.2 ± 0.3 keV [14]. This work also <lb/>provided the first conclusive evidence for the 3/2 <lb/> +  spin <lb/>assignment of this resonance. <lb/>We have extended this technique to measure the res-<lb/>onance strength of an important 3/2 <lb/> −  level at E  c.m.  = <lb/>330 keV [15]. Since the 1982 study by Wiescher and Ket-<lb/> 100 <lb/> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> 0.2 <lb/> 0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>E c.m.

The measured <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O cross-section is shown <lb/>along with a fit to the data. Since the width of the 330 keV <lb/>resonance is much less than the target energy loss, the curve <lb/>appears &quot; flat-topped &quot; at these energies. <lb/> tner [16] of the <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction, it has generally <lb/>been believed that the reaction rate is dominated over <lb/>a wide range of novae temperatures by a resonance at <lb/> E  c.m.  = 330 ± 6 keV that arises from a <lb/> 19  Ne level at <lb/> E  x  = 6.741 MeV. This analysis and all subsequent cal-<lb/>culations had to be based upon uncertain estimates of <lb/>the strength of this resonance. Such estimates may be in-<lb/>correct by an order of magnitude or more [7]. We have <lb/>made the first significant measurement of the strength of <lb/>this important resonance by measuring the yield of the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 18  F, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction on and off resonance. Because the <lb/>resonance energy was known well from previous studies <lb/>and because the resonance is rather narrow (Γ ∼ 3 keV), <lb/>we chose to measure the thick target yield by covering <lb/>the energy range ΔE  c.m.  = 305–350 keV within the target <lb/>energy loss. In such a study, a measurement of the step <lb/>height of the yield on resonance is directly related to the <lb/>resonance strength of the state. The same technique as <lb/>above was used to identify the events of interest, and the <lb/>results are shown in fig. 5 along with the cross-sections <lb/>from the 665 keV study. The best fit to the data was ob-<lb/>tained for a resonance strength of ωγ = 1.48±0.46 eV and <lb/>a resonance energy of 332 ± 17 keV [15]. <lb/>Additional constraints on the <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction <lb/>rate come from studies of the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 19  F reaction. Lev-<lb/>els in <lb/> 19  Ne containing strong single-proton components <lb/>should have mirror levels in <lb/> 19  F with strong single-neutron <lb/>components. The isospin mirrors to astrophysically im-<lb/>portant <lb/> 19  Ne levels should thus be strongly populated in <lb/>a study of the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 19  F reaction. Furthermore from <lb/>the observed magnitudes of the cross-sections to populate <lb/>the various states, one can use isospin-symmetry argu-<lb/>ments to constrain the proton-spectroscopic factors (and <lb/>thus the proton widths) of important <lb/> 19  Ne levels. <lb/>The <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 18  F, p) <lb/> 19  F reaction was studied at the <lb/>HRIBF [17] by bombarding a 160(10) μg/cm <lb/> 2  (CD  2  )  n  tar-<lb/>get of 98% enrichment for ∼ 3 days with an isotopi-<lb/>cally pure, 108.49 MeV <lb/> 18  F <lb/> +9  beam at an intensity of <lb/> ∼ 5×10 <lb/> 5  /s.

Open points are singles data <lb/>and solid points are events in coincidence with the annular <lb/>strip detector. Excitation energies are given in keV. <lb/> light charged particles were detected in the laboratory <lb/>angular range of 118 <lb/> •  –157 <lb/> •  , corresponding to &quot; forward &quot; <lb/>center-of-mass angles in the range 8 <lb/> •  –27 <lb/> •  . The beam en-<lb/>ergy was selected to be high enough for direct reaction <lb/>models, yet low enough to allow all the protons to be <lb/>stopped in the SIDAR. A silicon strip detector at the fo-<lb/>cal plane of the Daresbury Recoil Separator (DRS) [18] <lb/>was used to detect particle-stable recoils having A = 19 in <lb/>coincidence with the SIDAR. This coincidence efficiency <lb/>was essentially 100% of the +9 charge state fraction for <lb/>recoil angles &lt; 1.6 <lb/> •  and &gt; 70% overall for particle-stable <lb/>final states. Other recoils, from higher, α-decaying states <lb/>in <lb/> 19  F, were detected in coincidence just downstream from <lb/>the target with an annular strip detector. This detector <lb/>was also used for data normalization. Beam current nor-<lb/>malization was achieved by directly counting beam par-<lb/>ticles at low intensity with a retractable silicon surface <lb/>barrier detector placed temporarily at 0 <lb/> •  . The overall un-<lb/>certainty in normalization, estimated to be ∼ 10%, is ow-<lb/>ing mostly to uncertainty in target thickness. Independent <lb/>internal energy calibrations were obtained for each labora-<lb/>tory angle by using excitation energies of the well-known <lb/>levels at 1.554038(9), 4.377700(42), and 5.1066(9) MeV in <lb/> 19  F. This allowed excitation energies in the region of in-<lb/>terest to be determined with uncertainties ∼ 10 keV. <lb/>Singles and coincidence spectra in the (α-decaying) re-<lb/>gion of importance for novae are shown for a laboratory <lb/>angle of 147 <lb/> •  in fig. 6. The coincidence spectra contain <lb/>three main groups at about 6.5, 7.3, and 8.1 MeV excita-<lb/>tion energy. The coincidence efficiencies are roughly 50%, <lb/></body>

Our internal energy calibra-<lb/>tions allow identifications of these states which are con-<lb/>sistent with known levels in <lb/> 19  F, as indicated in fig. 6. <lb/>Considerable strength was observed in the 6497 keV 3/2 <lb/> + <lb/>19  F level, while we see no evidence for the 6528 keV state <lb/>as suggested in ref. [19]. This indicates that the  = 0 <lb/>strength near the proton threshold in <lb/> 19  Ne may well <lb/>be concentrated in a proton-bound state, or perhaps in <lb/>the 8 keV resonance. Furthermore, no evidence was ob-<lb/>served for a strong 3/2 <lb/> +  resonance reported previously <lb/>at 7101 keV [20]. Most likely the mirror to the important <lb/> 19  Ne resonance at 665 keV is thus contained in the doublet <lb/>observed near ∼ 7.3 MeV in fig. 6. This is consistent with <lb/>the results of recent reanalysis of <lb/> 15  N(α, α) <lb/> 15  N data [21]. <lb/>Combining these various pieces of information on <lb/> 19  Ne resonances, we have calculated improved values of <lb/>the <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction rate as a function of temper-<lb/>ature [17]. In fig. 7, we plot our calculated rate as the <lb/>shaded band along with the rate from ref. [7]. We find the <lb/>rate to be dominated by resonances at E  c.m.  = 330 and <lb/>665 keV for temperatures above 0.15 GK and by the reso-<lb/>nance at 38 keV for temperatures below this. The rate is <lb/>about two to five times smaller than that of Coc et al. [7] <lb/>in the nova temperature range. We have used this up-<lb/>dated <lb/> 18  F(p, α) <lb/> 15  O reaction rate in a nova nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis calculation based on a post-processing approach with <lb/>temperature and density histories of 28 zones of ejected <lb/>material determined from hydrodynamics calculations of <lb/>an explosion on the surface of a 1.25 solar mass white <lb/>dwarf star [22]. The tools for this calculation are online <lb/>in the Computational Infrastructure for Nuclear Astro-<lb/>physics [23]. Using these new rates, we find roughly a <lb/>factor of two more <lb/> 18  F is produced than previously cal-<lb/>culated, and thus <lb/> 18  F observations are more likely than <lb/>previously thought. <lb/> 4 Studies with <lb/> 7 Be beams <lb/> Interpretation of solar neutrino flux measurements re-<lb/>quires an accurate knowledge of the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B cross-<lb/> 7  Li <lb/> 7 Be <lb/> 8 B <lb/> Fig. 8. <lb/> 8  B recoils from the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B reaction are identified <lb/>in an ionization counter at the focal plane of the DRS. Scat-<lb/>tered low-energy projectiles of <lb/> 7  Li and <lb/> 7  Be are also observed. <lb/>22 <lb/> 8  B events were identified in this demonstration experiment. <lb/> section. There have been over a dozen measurements of <lb/>the reaction cross-section at a variety of energies, but all <lb/>relatively precise measurements have used a radioactive <lb/>(i.e., decaying) <lb/> 7  Be target and thus have similar system-<lb/>atic uncertainties. To achieve the desired precision, dif-<lb/>ferent approaches, which are not inhibited with the same <lb/>systematic effects, are necessary. <lb/>The present work [24] focuses on the development of <lb/>a new approach for the measurement of <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B, us-<lb/>ing a <lb/> 7  Be beam and a windowless hydrogen gas target at <lb/>ORNL. The possible systematic errors for this measure-<lb/>ment are different from those in normal kinematics using <lb/> 7  Be targets. In this case, the target is known to be pure H  2 <lb/> and to be of intransigent composition and thickness. Fur-<lb/>thermore, the transmission target allows the recoils to be <lb/>detected directly, and the systematic error in the number <lb/>of fusions is decreased in the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 7  Be, γ) <lb/> 8  B measurement, <lb/>due to high recoil-detection efficiency and low background. <lb/>However, low <lb/> 7  Be beam current limits the statistical pre-<lb/>cision of the measurement. Due to the statistical limita-<lb/>tions, our initial efforts will focus on the higher energy <lb/>region of the cross-sections (E  c.m.  = 1–2 MeV), where the <lb/>cross-section is highest and where the largest discrepancy <lb/>exists among the various models used to extrapolate the <lb/>cross-section to stellar energies [25]. <lb/>The <lb/> 7  Be used to make the radioactive beam was pro-<lb/>duced at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory <lb/>(TUNL) using the <lb/> 7  Li(p, n) <lb/> 7  Be reaction. A chemical pro-<lb/>cess was performed to purify the <lb/> 7  BeO material, which <lb/>was mixed with copper or silver in a powder matrix and <lb/>pressed into a pellet for use in a sputter ion source at the <lb/>HRIBF. The sputter source produced a low energy beam <lb/>of <lb/> 7  BeO <lb/> −  which was injected into the tandem accelerator <lb/>where it was broken up at the terminal by a gas strip-<lb/>per, and <lb/> 7  Be <lb/> 1+  was mass analyzed and accelerated to the <lb/>experiment. <lb/>Using this technique, a 12 MeV <lb/> 7  Be beam was deliv-<lb/>ered to the HRIBF windowless hydrogen gas target [18] <lb/>at an intensity of 2.5 ppA and mixed with <lb/> 7  Li at a ratio of <lb/></body>

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> 7  Be/ <lb/> 7  Li ∼ 1/7. The windowless gas target is described in <lb/>detail in ref. [18]. The <lb/> 8  B recoils were tuned through the <lb/>DRS, and counted and identified in the gas-filled ioniza-<lb/>tion counter. The spectrum from the ion counter is shown <lb/>in fig. 8. In this initial test measurement, 22 <lb/> 8  B recoils were <lb/>observed resulting in a rough cross-section measurement <lb/>of 1.12 μb with 24% uncertainty at E  c.m.  = 1.5 MeV. Fur-<lb/>ther measurements with higher <lb/> 7  Be beam intensities are <lb/>planned to obtain a more statistically significant value. <lb/>Another stellar burning reaction studied at the HRIBF <lb/>with <lb/> 7  Be beams was the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 3  He, 2p) <lb/> 4  He reaction. Ap-<lb/>proximately 86% of the hydrogen being processed to he-<lb/>lium in the sun flows through the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 3  He, 2p) <lb/> 4  He reac-<lb/>tion, and thus its rate has a direct effect on our under-<lb/>standing of stellar burning and solar neutrino flux ob-<lb/>servations. The LUNA Collaboration measured the cross-<lb/>section down to 16.5 keV, where the S-factor was observed <lb/>to increase because of the effect of electron screening [26, <lb/>27]. Electron screening effectively reduces the height of the <lb/>Coulomb barrier in the reaction resulting in an increase <lb/>in the measured S-factor and is typically parameterized in <lb/>terms of an electron screening potential, U  e  . It was found <lb/>in ref. [26] that the screening potential needed to repro-<lb/>duce the data was roughly twice the adiabatic (i.e., upper) <lb/>limit. While this discrepancy is not understood, it is clear <lb/>that we must understand electron screening because the <lb/>screening in the stellar plasma is quite different from that <lb/>in laboratory studies. The cross-sections measured in the <lb/>laboratory can only be related to the stellar reaction rate <lb/>if the screening potential is understood. The observed dis-<lb/>crepancy may, in part, be due to a broad <lb/> 6  Be resonance <lb/>near the <lb/> 3  He + <lb/> 3  He threshold at 11.49 MeV. Understand-<lb/>ing the level structure and determining the properties of <lb/>missing <lb/> 6  Be levels is thus important for understanding the <lb/>low energy behavior of the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 3  He, 2p) <lb/> 4  He reaction and <lb/>the electron screening potential. <lb/>There is considerable evidence that unobserved levels <lb/>do exist in this excitation energy region of <lb/> 6  Be. First of <lb/>all, several levels have been observed in the isospin mirror <lb/>nucleus, <lb/> 6  He, for which analogs have not been observed in <lb/> 6  Be [28]. In particular, two <lb/> 6  He levels at 14.6 and 15.5 MeV <lb/>should have analog levels in <lb/> 6  Be near or above the <lb/> 3  He + <lb/> 3  He threshold at 11.49 MeV. Levels have been predicted <lb/>at 12.8, 14.7, and 23.8 MeV [29]. Furthermore, a recent <lb/>measurement at Notre Dame found tentative evidence for <lb/>a <lb/> 6  Be level at 9.6 MeV [30]. <lb/>To search for these unobserved resonances, we have <lb/>studied the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 7  Be, t) <lb/> 6  Be reaction by bombarding a <lb/> ∼ 1 mg/cm <lb/> 2  CD  2  target with a 100 MeV <lb/> 7  Be <lb/> 4+  beam. <lb/>Typical beam intensities were 3 × 10 <lb/> 6 7  Be/s, and since <lb/>the beam was fully stripped at the terminal, there was <lb/>no <lb/> 7  Li contamination in the beam. Tritons were detected <lb/>and identified by the SIDAR array configured in telescope <lb/>mode with 100 μm thick detectors backed by 500 μm thick <lb/>detectors covering laboratory angles between ∼ 11 <lb/> •  and <lb/>33 <lb/> •  . With this range of laboratory angles and detector <lb/>thicknesses, we should be sensitive to <lb/> 6  Be levels between <lb/> E  x  ∼ 2 and 13 MeV. A typical particle identification plot <lb/>is shown in fig. 9. Unfortunately, it was found that a large <lb/> Fig. 9. A particle identification plot from the study of the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 7  Be, t) <lb/> 6  Be reaction is shown. A veto condition has been <lb/>applied which reduces the effect of &quot; punch-through &quot; <lb/> 3  He ions <lb/>near the triton locus by ∼ 95%. <lb/> number of high-energy <lb/> 3  He ions are emitted, presumably <lb/>from α transfer on to carbon in the target. These <lb/> 3  He <lb/>ions penetrate the stopping detector producing a back-<lb/>bending locus in the particle-identification plot which in-<lb/>terferes with the clean identification of tritons. To reduce <lb/>this effect, a third layer (300 μm thick) of silicon-strip de-<lb/>tectors was added to be used as veto detectors. To produce <lb/>the plot in fig. 9, the absence of a veto detector hit is re-<lb/>quired. This condition was effective in reducing the punch-<lb/>through <lb/> 3  He ions around the triton group by about 95%. <lb/>Nonetheless, some contamination of the triton group was <lb/>still observed. Runs were also taken with similar thickness <lb/>CH  2  targets from which it was observed that the number <lb/>of tritons produced per beam particle was reduced by a <lb/>factor of 2.4. Therefore, over 70% of the observed tritons <lb/>are indeed due to <lb/> 7  Be+d reactions. This data is currently <lb/>in a preliminary stage of analysis so no conclusions have <lb/>yet been drawn concerning the level structure of <lb/> 6  Be. <lb/> 5 Studies with neutron-rich beams <lb/> The r process produces roughly half of the elements heav-<lb/>ier than iron via a series of neutron captures and β decays <lb/>flowing through extremely neutron-rich nuclei. The reac-<lb/>tion path and abundances produced are uncertain, how-<lb/>ever, because of the lack of information on the properties <lb/>and structure of extremely neutron-rich nuclei. Recently, <lb/>accelerated beams of many neutron-rich nuclei have be-<lb/>come available at the HRIBF [3] making possible some of <lb/>the first studies of reactions on nuclei along the r-process <lb/> path. While no single measurement is likely to make a <lb/>tremendous difference in r-process calculations, under-<lb/>standing the evolution of shell structure certainly will. <lb/></body>

The top plot shows clear separation of Ge from Se in the ionization counter. By requiring a coincidence with recoil <lb/>Ge ions, protons detected by the SIDAR array from the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 82  Ge, p) <lb/> 83  Ge reaction are identified. <lb/> The low-lying single-particle structure of neutron-rich <lb/>nuclei near closed shells is especially important for under-<lb/>standing how the synthesis of elements in the r process <lb/>may be modified by neutron-capture reactions following <lb/>the fallout from nuclear statistical equilibrium [31]. The <lb/>distribution of nuclei concentrates in tightly-bound iso-<lb/>topes near closed shells. As the material cools, neutron <lb/>captures and β decays of these near-closed-shell nuclei al-<lb/>ter the abundance pattern. Neutron capture reactions on <lb/>neutron-rich, closed-shell nuclei are expected to be dom-<lb/>inated by direct capture to bound states because of the <lb/>small Q values for neutron capture and the low-level den-<lb/>sity in the compound nucleus. Direct capture rates on <lb/>these nuclei depend sensitively on the structure of low-<lb/>energy states —such as energy levels, spins, parities, elec-<lb/>tromagnetic transition probabilities, and single-particle <lb/>spectroscopic factors— and typically cannot be accurately <lb/>estimated in the absence of experimental data [32]. It is, <lb/>therefore, critical that direct capture rate calculations be <lb/>supplemented with experimental data near closed shells <lb/>where the r-process abundances peak. <lb/>Low-lying single-neutron excitations in <lb/> 83  Ge have been <lb/>studied for the first time using the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 82  Ge, p) <lb/> 83  Ge reac-<lb/>tion [33]. Previously, only the half-life (t  1/2  = 1.85 s) of the <lb/> N = 51 nucleus had been measured. The A = 83 isotope <lb/>of Ge has seven neutrons more than the last stable Ge <lb/>nucleus, but it is only one neutron past the N = 50 closed <lb/>shell. It is far enough from stability to lie on the path in <lb/>some r-process models, but its low-lying spectrum is still <lb/>expected to exhibit the simple characteristics of single-<lb/>particle structure. With the (d, p) transfer reaction, neu-<lb/>tron single-particle states are selectively populated, and <lb/>proton angular distributions reveal orbital angular mo-<lb/>menta and single-particle strengths of final states. Because <lb/>the mass of <lb/> 82  Ge has been measured, a measurement of the <lb/> Q value of the reaction also determines the mass of <lb/> 83  Ge. <lb/>A beam of <lb/> 82  Ge (t  1/2  = 4.6 s) was produced at the <lb/>HRIBF by bombarding a UC target with a 42 MeV proton <lb/>beam inducing fission of the uranium. Produced A = 82 <lb/>ions (Se:Ge:As = 85:15:&lt; 1) were accelerated to 330 MeV <lb/>before delivery to the experiment. Beam currents of <lb/> 82  Ge <lb/>averaged 10 <lb/> 4  /s. The isobarically mixed A = 82 beam <lb/>was used to bombard a 430 μg/cm <lb/> 2  CD  2  target. Protons <lb/>from the (d, p) reaction were detected in the SIDAR array <lb/>at backward laboratory angles (θ  lab  = 105 <lb/> •  –150 <lb/> •  ) corre-<lb/>sponding to forward angles in the center of mass (θ  c.m.  = <lb/>36 <lb/> •  –11 <lb/> •  ). In coincidence with protons, beam-like recoils <lb/>were detected and identified at forward angles (θ  lab  &lt; 1 <lb/> •  ) <lb/>in the gas filled ionization counter shown in fig. 1. The co-<lb/>incidence requirement was necessary to distinguish (d, p) <lb/> protons induced by <lb/> 82  Ge projectiles from those induced <lb/>by <lb/> 82  Se. This selection is shown in fig. 10. Events from <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 82  Ge, p) <lb/> 83  Ge and <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 82  Se, p) <lb/> 83  Se are clearly visible af-<lb/>ter the recoil selection. <lb/>The Q-value for populating the ground state of <lb/> 83  Ge <lb/>was found to be 1.47 ± 0.02 MeV resulting in a mass ex-<lb/>cess of Δ( <lb/> 83  Ge) = 61.25 ± 0.26 MeV, where the uncer-<lb/>tainty is mostly the result of the uncertainty in the mass <lb/> 104 <lb/> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> 5 <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>1 5 <lb/>2 0 <lb/>2 5 <lb/>3 0 <lb/>3 5 <lb/>4 0 <lb/> θ  c.m.

In <lb/>the present inverse kinematics study, with the silicon ar-<lb/>ray covering backwards laboratory angles, elastic scatter-<lb/>ing could not be measured. Even so, the global optical <lb/>model parameters as deduced by Lohr and Haeberli [34] <lb/>(deuterons) and Varner et al. [35] (protons) are well suited <lb/>for this mass and energy region. Using the DWBA code <lb/>TWOFNR [36] and global parameter sets for the optical <lb/>model potentials from refs. [34,35], the fits in fig. 11 were <lb/>produced. The best fits supported a J <lb/> π  = 5/2 <lb/> +  assign-<lb/>ment for the ground state and 1/2 <lb/> +  assignment for the <lb/>first excited state with spectroscopic factors of 0.48 ± 0.14 <lb/>and 0.50 ± 0.15, respectively. <lb/>Our second measurement with neutron-rich beams was <lb/>a study of the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 84  Se, p) <lb/> 85  Se reaction [37]. Since the re-<lb/>action kinematics are nearly identical to the <lb/> 82  Ge case, the <lb/>detector setup was nearly the same as well. A 4.5 MeV/u <lb/> A = 84 beam was used to bombard a 200 μg/cm <lb/> 2  CD  2 <lb/> target for nearly 10 days. The higher beam energy and <lb/>thinner target used in this study resulted in a better en-<lb/>ergy resolution than in the <lb/> 82  Ge study (ΔE  c.m.  ∼ 220 keV <lb/>compared with ∼ 300 keV in the <lb/> 82  Ge case). The beam <lb/>consisted mainly of <lb/> 84  Br (93%) and <lb/> 84  Se (7%), and the <lb/>total beam current was ∼ 9 × 10 <lb/> 4  pps. <lb/> 85  Se levels at E  x  = <lb/>0, 0.462, 1.114, and ∼ 1.44 MeV were observed. DWBA <lb/>fits to the ground and first excited states were again con-<lb/>sistent with 5/2 <lb/> +  and 1/2 <lb/> +  spin/parity assignments with <lb/>spectroscopic factors of 0.33±0.08 and 0.30±0.08, respec-<lb/>tively. A summary of our results of (d, p) measurements <lb/>on N = 50 nuclei is shown in fig. 12. <lb/>We are poised to extend these measurements to the <lb/>next closed neutron shell at N = 82 by studying (d, p) <lb/> reactions on <lb/> 130,132  Sn.

At the HRIBF, it is possible to accelerate <lb/>beams of <lb/> 130,132  Sn to energies around the Coulomb barrier <lb/>with sufficient intensity to begin such studies. <lb/>The (d, p) cross-section to populate low lying, low an-<lb/>gular momentum states is often greater at lower beam <lb/>energies, due to kinematic matching conditions, and at <lb/>the same time the reaction is cleaner as there are few <lb/>reaction channels open. However, angular distributions <lb/>below the Coulomb barrier become less distinctive, and <lb/>it was not clear that  values and spectroscopic factors <lb/>could be extracted under such conditions. To examine <lb/>these possible difficulties, we have performed a study of <lb/>the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 124  Sn, p) <lb/> 125  Sn reaction [45]. This reaction has been <lb/>studied at several energies in normal kinematics and was <lb/>therefore a good benchmark [46,47]. <lb/>A beam of <lb/> 124  Sn was accelerated to 562 MeV and fo-<lb/>cused onto a 100 μg/cm <lb/> 2  target of deuterated polyethy-<lb/>lene (CD  2  ). The target was turned 30 <lb/> •  with respect to the <lb/>beam, thus achieving an effective thickness of 200 μg/cm <lb/> 2 <lb/> and at the same time allowing emerging protons to be <lb/>detected around θ  lab  = 90 <lb/> •  without being shadowed by <lb/>the target frame. Protons were detected in two telescopes <lb/>of silicon detectors. One telescope on the downstream side <lb/>subtended θ  lab  = 70 <lb/> •  –102 <lb/> •  . The other telescope on the up-<lb/>stream side subtended θ  lab  = 85 <lb/> •  –110 <lb/> •  . The SIDAR array <lb/>was mounted at more backward angles θ  lab  = 130 <lb/> •  –160 <lb/> •  . <lb/>The telescopes consisted of a thin position-sensitive (ΔE) <lb/>detector and a thicker stopping (E) detector (1000 μm). <lb/> The ΔE detectors were either 65 or 140 μm thick depend-<lb/>ing on the angles (and thus the proton energies) needed. <lb/>Both ΔE detectors had 16 position-sensitive strips allow-<lb/>ing the angle of proton emission to be determined to a <lb/>precision of ±0.5 <lb/> •  . <lb/>Data were collected for about 18 hours with a beam <lb/>rate of 10 <lb/> 7 124  Sn/s. The angles of particles measured in <lb/>the downstream telescope are shown as a function of their <lb/>energy in fig. 13.

We have used the <lb/>tools available at nucastrodata.org to quantify the ef-<lb/>fect and calculate that roughly a factor of 2 more <lb/> 18  F is <lb/>ejected than previously thought. <lb/>We are using <lb/> 7  Be beams to study reactions of impor-<lb/>tance to stellar burning. By bombarding a windowless hy-<lb/>drogen target with the <lb/> 7  Be beam and detecting recoil <lb/> 8  B <lb/>nuclei at the focal plane of the Daresbury Recoil Separa-<lb/>tor, we are on the verge of making the first statistically-<lb/>significant measurement of <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B in inverse kine-<lb/>matics. Only after several measurements with different <lb/>systematic uncertainties, can the community hope to ob-<lb/>tain a truly precise measure of the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B reaction <lb/>rate at stellar energies. We are also studying the unbound <lb/>nucleus, <lb/> 6  Be, via a measurement of the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 7  Be, t) <lb/> 6  Be re-<lb/>action at 100 MeV.

They constitute dramatic stellar explosions occur-<lb/>ring in interacting binary systems, where a compact white <lb/>dwarf (the stellar remnant of a Main Sequence star with <lb/>a mass below ∼ 10 M   ; white dwarfs have planetary di-<lb/>mensions and masses typically in the range 0.6–1.4 M   ) <lb/>accretes material from a low-mass Main Sequence com-<lb/>panion. In contrast, X-ray bursts have been discovered <lb/>much recently, since a major fraction of their energy out-<lb/>put is emitted in X-rays, and hence, detection requires the <lb/>use of space observatories. About 65 Galactic low-mass <lb/>X-ray binaries that exhibit such bursting behavior have <lb/>been found since the independent discovery by Grindlay <lb/> et al. (1976) [1] and Belian et al. (1976) [2]. In these sys-<lb/>tems, the explosion takes place in an even more compact <lb/>stellar remnant: a neutron star (with a mass about 1–2 <lb/>M   , and a very small diameter, 20 to 30 km only; neutron <lb/>stars formation accompanies some type II supernova ex-<lb/>plosions for stars more massive than ∼ 10 M   , but can be <lb/>formed also in other processes such as the so-called &quot; ac-<lb/>cretion induced collapse &quot; of a white dwarf; see Swank et <lb/> a  e-mail: jjose@ieec.fcr.es <lb/> al. (1978) [3] for an account of the identification of a neu-<lb/>tron star as the central emitting source in the bursting <lb/>system 3U 0614 +09). In all these cataclysmic systems, <lb/>mass transfer episodes, caused by Roche lobe overflows of <lb/>the Main Sequence companion, proceed through the in-<lb/>ner Lagrangian point of the system, forming an accretion <lb/>disk around the compact star. A fraction of the material <lb/>contained in the accretion disk ultimately falls on top of <lb/>the white dwarf (as a result of angular momentum losses <lb/>driven by dissipative forces in the disk), where it is gradu-<lb/>ally compressed up to degenerate conditions, thus leading <lb/>to a thermonuclear runaway (TNR). The estimated num-<lb/>ber of nova events in our Galaxy is about 30 ± 10 yr <lb/> −1 <lb/> (Shafter, 2002, [4]). Contrary to type Ia supernovae, for <lb/>which the white dwarf is fully disrupted by the strength of <lb/>the explosion, classical novae are expected to recur within <lb/>a timescale of the order of 10 <lb/> 4  –10 <lb/> 5  yr (Warner, 1995, [5]); <lb/>in contrast, X-Ray bursts recur on timescales from hours <lb/>to days (see Strohmayer and Bildsten, 2006, [6] for a re-<lb/>cent review). These stellar explosions are characterized by <lb/>a remarkable energy output, of the order of 10 <lb/> 39  ergs (X-<lb/>ray bursts), 10 <lb/> 45  ergs (classical novae), and 10 <lb/> 51  ergs (su-<lb/>pernovae). A major difference between these cataclysmic <lb/>events is the amount of mass ejected as well as the mean <lb/>ejection velocities: whereas in a type Ia supernova, the <lb/>whole star (cf., 1.4 M   ) is ejected at &gt; 10 <lb/> 4  km s <lb/> −1  , the <lb/></body>

			<body> explosion in both classical novae and X-ray bursts is re-<lb/>stricted to the accreted envelope. Hence, 10 <lb/> −4  –10 <lb/> −5  M  <lb/> are typically ejected during nova outbursts, at mean ejec-<lb/>tion velocities ranging from 10 <lb/> 2  –10 <lb/> 3  km s <lb/> −1  . In contrast, <lb/>it is likely that in a typical X-ray burst no mass ejection <lb/>takes place, because of the extreme escape velocities from <lb/>a neutron star (the energy required to escape from the <lb/>strong gravitational field of a neutron star of mass M and <lb/>radius R is GM m  p  /R ∼ 200 MeV/nucleon, whereas the <lb/>nuclear energy released from fusion of solar-like matter <lb/>into Fe-group elements is just ∼ 5 MeV/nucleon). <lb/> 2 Classical nova explosions <lb/> The canonical scenario of classical novae consists of an ini-<lb/>tially low-luminosity white dwarf accreting H-rich matter <lb/>from a low-mass Main Sequence companion, at an accre-<lb/>tion rate low enough to allow the building-up of an en-<lb/>velope where the TNR takes place. Accretion compresses <lb/>matter to large densities, such that material becomes de-<lb/>generate. Once H-ignition conditions are reached, a ther-<lb/>monuclear runaway takes place, since degenerate matter <lb/>cannot expand when heated. The large energetic output <lb/>produced by nuclear reactions cannot be only evacuated <lb/>by radiation, and hence convection sets in and transports <lb/>the β <lb/> +  -unstable nuclei to the outer cooler regions where <lb/>their decay provokes the nova outburst: the sudden release <lb/>of energy from those β <lb/> +  -decays increases the temperature <lb/>and the entropy of the material; as a result, the envelope <lb/>degeneracy is lifted and expansion sets in, paving the road <lb/>to the ejection stage. Therefore, the TNR is halted by the <lb/>envelope expansion rather than by fuel consumption. An-<lb/>other important effect of convection is that it transports <lb/>fresh unburned material to the burning shell, and hence, <lb/>non-equilibrium burning occurs and the resulting nucle-<lb/>osynthesis will be far from that of hydrostatic hydrogen <lb/>burning. It is important to stress that significant amounts <lb/>of CNO nuclei are required to let the ignition process really <lb/>progress into a thermonuclear runaway and indeed to get <lb/>an (energetic enough) explosion, and also to account for <lb/>the inferred abundances from nova shells. Mixing episodes <lb/>between the solar-like accreted envelope matter and the <lb/>outer layers of the underlying white dwarf core have been <lb/>invoked to account for the source of those CNO nuclei. <lb/>Nova explosions can occur in two types of white dwarfs: <lb/>carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe). The first <lb/>one correspond to the end-product of a star with a mass <lb/>below ∼ 10 M   , which undergoes two evolutionary stages, <lb/>central hydrogen burning and central helium burning, <lb/>leaving a carbon and oxygen-rich object (CO) supported <lb/>by electron pressure (in contrast, neutron stars balance <lb/>the strong gravitational force by means of neutron pres-<lb/>sure). More massive progenitors undergo an additional <lb/>stage, that is non-degenerate carbon ignition, leading to <lb/>the formation of an oxygen and neon-rich core (ONe), with <lb/>traces of magnesium and sodium. The cut-off mass, that <lb/>somewhat distinguishes both white dwarf subclasses, is <lb/>about 1.1 M   . It is important to stress that historically, <lb/>these cores were thought to be made of oxygen, neon and <lb/>magnesium (the so-called ONeMg white dwarfs) on the <lb/>basis of parametrized calculations of hydrostatic carbon <lb/>burning (Arnett and Truran, 1969, [7]), but more recent, <lb/>self-consistent models of sAGB (super-asymptotic giant <lb/>branch) stars, following the thermally pulsing phases, have <lb/>shown that the amount of <lb/> 24  Mg in these cores is much <lb/>smaller than expected (i.e., smaller than <lb/> 23  Na; see Domí <lb/>nguez et al., 1993, [8]; Ritossa et al., 1996, [9]). It is also <lb/>worth noting that these ONe white dwarfs have thick CO <lb/>buffers on top of their very cores. Explosions on top of <lb/>these objects (before a significant number of outbursts <lb/>may erode the buffer) may be misclassified as non-neon <lb/>(CO) novae, since their spectra will not show evidence for <lb/>strong neon lines. These and other weird nucleosynthetic <lb/>patterns have been predicted to accompany these explo-<lb/>sions (see José et al., 2003, [10] for details). <lb/>It is important to stress that the injection of &quot; seed &quot; nu-<lb/>clei in the Ne-Si mass region, resulting from mixing with <lb/>an ONe white dwarf, withdraws the main argument in <lb/>support of CNO-breakout in classical novae. Indeed, re-<lb/>cent estimates of several CNO-breakout reactions (see, for <lb/>instance, Davids et al., 2003, [11] for <lb/> 15  O(α, γ)), demon-<lb/>strate that at the typical temperatures attained during <lb/>nova outbursts the CNO cycle does not break out (con-<lb/>trary to what happens for X-ray bursts, for which peak <lb/>temperatures are almost an order of magnitude higher <lb/>than in classical nova outbursts). <lb/>In nova outbursts, the main nuclear activity is associ-<lb/>ated with (p, γ) and (p, α) reactions, running between the <lb/>line of stable nuclei and the proton drip line. Some of these <lb/>rates have been measured at the right energy range in the <lb/>laboratory since at the typical temperatures achieved dur-<lb/>ing nova outbursts, measurements of nuclear cross sections <lb/>in the region of the Gamow peak are, except for a few ex-<lb/>ceptions, feasible. In this sense, classical nova are unique <lb/>stellar explosions, and represent the only explosive site for <lb/>which the nuclear physics input is (or will be in the near <lb/>future) primarily based on experimental information (see <lb/>José et al., 2006, [12]). <lb/> 2.1 The role of nova outbursts in the galactic alchemy <lb/> As discussed above, the moderately high peak temper-<lb/>atures achieved during nova explosions, T  peak  ∼ (2–3)× <lb/>10 <lb/> 8  K, suggest that abundance levels of the intermediate-<lb/>mass elements in the ejecta must be significantly <lb/>enhanced, as confirmed by spectroscopic determinations <lb/>in well-observed nova shells. This raises the issue of the <lb/>potential contribution of novae to the Galactic abun-<lb/>dances, which can be roughly estimated as the product <lb/>of the Galactic nova rate (∼ 30 events yr <lb/> −1  ), the average <lb/>ejected mass per nova outburst (∼ 2 × 10 <lb/> −5  M   ), and the <lb/>Galaxy&apos;s lifetime (∼ 10 Gyr). This order of magnitude <lb/>estimate points out that novae scarcely contribute to <lb/>the Galaxy&apos;s overall metallicity (as compared with other <lb/>major sources, such as supernova explosions or AGB <lb/>stars), but nevertheless they can substantially contribute <lb/>to the synthesis of some largely overproduced species. <lb/>Indeed, studies suggest that classical novae are likely sites <lb/></body>

Because of the lower peak temperatures <lb/>achieved in CO models (together with the lack of signifi-<lb/>cant amounts of &quot; seed &quot; nuclei in the NeNa-MgAl region), <lb/>the main nuclear activity in CO novae does not extend <lb/>much beyond oxygen. In contrast, ONe models show a <lb/>much larger nuclear activity, extending up to silicon (for <lb/>1.15 M   ONe) or argon (for 1.35 M   ONe). Hence, the <lb/>presence of significantly large amounts of intermediate-<lb/>mass nuclei in the spectra, such as phosphorus, sulfur, <lb/>chlorine or argon, may reveal the presence of an underly-<lb/>ing massive ONe white dwarf. Another trend derived from <lb/>the analysis of the nucleosynthesis accompanying nova <lb/>outbursts is the fact that the O/N and C/N ratios de-<lb/>crease as the mass of the white dwarf (and hence, the peak <lb/>temperature attained during the explosion) increases. <lb/> 2.2 The abundance pattern of nova shells <lb/> In order to constraint models, several works have focused <lb/>on a direct comparison of the atomic abundances inferred <lb/>from observations of the ejecta with the theoretical nucle-<lb/>osynthetic output (see José and Hernanz, 1998, [14]; Star-<lb/>rfield et al., 1998, [13]; Kovetz and Prialnik, 1997, [15], <lb/>and references therein; see also Yaron et al., 2005, [16]). <lb/>This comparison itself is not very restrictive since obser-<lb/>vations provide only information on elemental abundances <lb/>(i.e., for O we get the total contribution from <lb/> 16  O, <lb/> 17  O, <lb/>and <lb/> 18  O). Indeed, these atomic abundances are not ab-<lb/>solute but relative to one element (often, hydrogen), and <lb/>they cannot be directly inferred from observations: their <lb/>determination involves modeling through photoionization <lb/>codes or other numerical techniques. Nevertheless, and de-<lb/>spite of the problems associated with the modeling of the <lb/>explosion (Starrfield, 2002, [17]), there is, in general, good <lb/>agreement between theory and observations as regards nu-<lb/>cleosynthesis (i.e., including atomic abundances —H, He, <lb/>C, O, Ne, Na-Fe—, and a plausible endpoint for nova nu-<lb/>cleosynthesis). In some cases, such as for PW Vul 1984, <lb/>the agreement between observations and theoretical pre-<lb/>dictions (see José and Hernanz, 1998, [14], Table 5, for de-<lb/>tails) is quite remarkable. The reader is referred to Gehrz <lb/> et al. (1998) [18] for an extended list of abundance deter-<lb/>minations in the ejecta from novae. <lb/>Since the nuclear path is very sensitive to details of <lb/>the evolution (chemical composition, extend of convective <lb/>mixing, thermal history of the envelope. . . ), the agree-<lb/>ment between the inferred abundances and the theoretical <lb/>yields suggests that the overall picture, in the framework <lb/>of the thermonuclear runaway model, is reasonably well <lb/>understood. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 2.3 Presolar grains <lb/> Infrared (Evans, 1990, [19]; Gehrz et al., 1998, [18]) and <lb/>ultraviolet observations of the temporal evolution of nova <lb/>light curves suggest that novae form grains in the expand-<lb/>ing nova shells. Both CO and ONe novae behave similarly <lb/>in the infrared right after the outburst. However, as the <lb/>ejected envelope expands and becomes optically thin, such <lb/>behavior dramatically changes: CO novae are typically fol-<lb/>lowed by a phase of dust formation corresponding to a <lb/>decline in visual light, together with a simultaneous rise <lb/>in the infrared emission (Rawlings and Evans, 2002, [20]; <lb/>Gehrz, 2002, [21]). In contrast, it has been argued that <lb/>ONe novae (that involve more massive white dwarfs than <lb/>CO novae) are not so prolific producers of dust as a result <lb/>of the lower mass, high-velocity ejecta, where the typical <lb/>densities can be low enough to enable the condensation <lb/>of appreciable amounts of dust. Indeed, infrared measure-<lb/>ments in a number of recent novae have revealed the pres-<lb/>ence of C-rich dust (Novae Aql 1995, V838 Her 1991, PW <lb/>Vul 1984, . . .), SiC (Novae Aql 1982, V842 Cen 1986, . . .), <lb/> hydrocarbons (Novae V842 Cen 1986, V705 Cas 1993, . . .), <lb/> or SiO2 (Novae V1370 Aql 1982, V705 Cas 1993). Remark-<lb/>able examples, such as nova QV Vul 1987, exhibited simul-<lb/>taneous formation of all those types of dust (see Gehrz et <lb/>al., 1998, [18] for details on dust forming novae). <lb/>Since the first studies of dust formation in classical no-<lb/>vae (Clayton and Hoyle, 1976, [22]), the identification of <lb/>presolar nova grains in the laboratory (isolated from mete-<lb/>orites), presumably condensed in the shells ejected during <lb/>the explosion, relied only on low <lb/> 20  Ne/ <lb/> 22  Ne ratios (with <lb/> 22  Ne attributed to <lb/> 22  Na in situ decay, rather than trapped <lb/> 22  Ne, since noble gases do not condense into grains). But <lb/>quite recently, five silicon carbide and two graphite grains <lb/>(isolated from both the Murchison and Acfer 094 mete-<lb/>orites) that exhibit isotopic signatures characteristic of <lb/>nova nucleosynthesis, have been identified (Amari et al., <lb/> 2001, [23]; Amari, 2002, [24]). These grains are charac-<lb/>terized by low <lb/> 12  C/ <lb/> 13  C and <lb/> 14  N/ <lb/> 15  N ratios, <lb/> 30  Si excesses <lb/>and close-to or slightly lower-than-solar <lb/> 29  Si/ <lb/> 28  Si ratios, <lb/>high <lb/> 26  Al/ <lb/> 27  Al ratios (determined only for two grains) and <lb/>low <lb/> 20  Ne/ <lb/> 22  Ne ratios (only measured in the graphite grain <lb/>KFB1a-161). This discovery provides valuable constraints <lb/>for nova nucleosynthesis models (in contrast to observa-<lb/>tions of nova shells, for which only atomic abundances are <lb/>inferred). Theoretical efforts to predict the expected im-<lb/>prints of nova outbursts on presolar grains have been con-<lb/>ducted by several authors (Starrfield et al., 1997, [25]; José <lb/> et al., 2003 [26]; 2004 [27]), including preliminary work on <lb/>equilibrium condensation sequences in the ejected shells <lb/>(José et al., 2004, [27]). These studies suggest that clas-<lb/>sical novae may contribute to the known presolar corun-<lb/>dum (Al  2  O  3  ), spinel (MgAl  2  O  4  ), enstatite (MgSiO  3  ), sil-<lb/>icon carbide (SiC) and silicon nitride (Si  3  N  4  ) grain pop-<lb/>ulations. Aspects, such as the conditions that character-<lb/>ize grain formation in novae deserve more attention (see <lb/>Shore and Gehrz, 2004, [28] for an insight into dynamic <lb/>grain formation driven by photo-ionization). <lb/> 2.4 Nova radioactivities <lb/> Among the isotopes synthesized during classical nova out-<lb/>bursts, several radioactive species have deserved special <lb/></note>

			<body> attention. Short-lived nuclei, such as <lb/> 14,15  O and <lb/> 17  F (and <lb/>to some extent <lb/> 13  N) have been identified as the key iso-<lb/>topes that power the expansion and further ejection of the <lb/>envelope during nova outbursts through a sudden release <lb/>of energy, a few minutes after peak temperature (Star-<lb/>rfield et al., 1972, [29]). Other isotopes have been exten-<lb/>sively investigated in connection with the predicted γ-ray <lb/> output from novae (Clayton and Hoyle, 1974, [30]; Clay-<lb/>ton, 1981, [31]; Leising and Clayton, 1987, [32]). Hence, <lb/> 13  N and <lb/> 18  F are responsible for the predicted prompt γ-<lb/> ray emission (Hernanz et al., 1999, [33]) at and below <lb/>511 keV, whereas <lb/> 7  Be and <lb/> 22  Na (Gómez-Gomar et al., <lb/> 1998, [34]), which decay much later (when the envelope is <lb/>optically thin), are the sources that power line emission at <lb/>478 and 1275 keV, respectively. <lb/> 26  Al is another important <lb/>radioactive isotope that can be synthesized during nova <lb/>outbursts, although only its cumulative emission can be <lb/>observed because of its slow decay. We will briefly focus on <lb/>the corresponding nuclear paths leading to the synthesis <lb/>of the above-mentioned gamma-ray emitters, with special <lb/>emphasis on the nuclear uncertainties associated with the <lb/>relevant reaction rates. <lb/> 2.4.1 <lb/> 7  Be-<lb/> 7  Li <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be is the main reaction leading to <lb/> 7  Be synthe-<lb/>sis, which is transformed into <lb/> 7  Li by means of an electron <lb/>capture, emitting a γ-ray photon of 478 keV. The contri-<lb/>bution of nova outbursts to the Galactic <lb/> 7  Li content has <lb/>been regarded as very controversial. Hints from the first <lb/>pioneering estimate, in the framework of a simple para-<lb/>metric model (Arnould and Nørgaard, 1975, [35]), were <lb/>confirmed by early hydrodynamic simulations (Starrfield <lb/> et al., 1978, [36]), assuming however an envelope in-place, <lb/>thus neglecting the impact of the accretion phase on the <lb/>evolution. These results were preliminary refuted later on, <lb/>in terms of parametric one/two zone models (Boffin et <lb/>al., 1993, [37]), pointing out the critical role played by <lb/>the <lb/> 8  B(p, γ) reaction, not included in all previous works <lb/>(i.e., Arnould and Nørgaard, 1975, [35], Starrfield et al., <lb/> 1978, [36]), and claiming therefore for an unlikely synthesis <lb/>of <lb/> 7  Li in novae. The scenario was later revisited by Her-<lb/>nanz et al. (1996) [38] and José and Hernanz (1998) [14], <lb/>who performed new hydrodynamic calculations, taking <lb/>into account both the accretion and explosion stages, and <lb/>a full reaction network (including <lb/> 8  B(p, γ)). These stud-<lb/>ies confirmed that the Be-transport mechanism (Cameron, <lb/>1955, [39]) is capable of producing large amounts of <lb/> 7  Li <lb/>during nova explosions. <lb/>Among the key issues that may affect <lb/> 7  Li synthesis in <lb/>novae, one of the most critical ones is the final amount of <lb/> 3  He that survives the early rise in temperature when the <lb/>thermonuclear runaway ensues. In particular, the different <lb/>timescales to reach T  peak  achieved for CO and ONe novae, <lb/>which deeply depend on the initial <lb/> 12  C content in the en-<lb/>velope, lead to larger amounts of <lb/> 7  Be in CO novae (which <lb/>survives destruction through (p, γ) reactions because of <lb/>the very efficient inverse photodisintegration reaction on <lb/> 8  B). No relevant nuclear uncertainties in the domain of <lb/>nova temperatures affect the main reaction rates for <lb/> 7  Li <lb/>synthesis. It is also worth noting that the potential con-<lb/>tribution of classical novae to the Galactic <lb/> 7  Li content is <lb/>rather small (less than 15%, according to models). How-<lb/>ever, a nova contribution is required to match the <lb/> 7  Li con-<lb/>tent in realistic calculations of Galactic chemical evolution <lb/>(Romano et al., 1999, [40]; Alibés et al., 2002, [41]). <lb/>The observation of <lb/> 7  Li in the ejecta accompanying <lb/>nova outbursts is extraordinarily challenging. Recently, <lb/>the presence of this elusive isotope in an ejected nova en-<lb/>velope has been claimed for the first time: an observed fea-<lb/>ture compatible with the doublet at 6708Å of Li I has been <lb/>reported in the spectra of V382 Vel (Nova Velorum 1999; <lb/>see Della Valle et al., 2002, [42]). However, it has been <lb/>argued (Shore et al., 2003, [43]) that the observed feature <lb/>may correspond instead to another low-ionization emission <lb/>centered at around 6705Å, likely the doublet associated <lb/>with N I. Attempts to detect the 478 keV line associated to <lb/> 7  Be-<lb/> 7  Li in a classical nova outburst (with the GRS instru-<lb/>ment on-board the SMM satellite (Harris et al., 1991, [44]) <lb/>or with the TGRS spectrometer on-board WIND (Harris <lb/> et al., 2001, [45])), have also been unsuccessful to date. <lb/>Unfortunately, current prospects with ESA&apos;s INTEGRAL <lb/>satellite are not much better, because of the small fluxes <lb/>expected from novae and the limited sensitivity of the IN-<lb/>TEGRAL detectors. The predicted detectability distance <lb/>of the 478 keV line (a γ-ray signal that may last for about <lb/>2 months) is of the order of only ≤ 0.2 kpc for INTE-<lb/>GRAL/SPI (Hernanz and José, 2004, [46]). Future instru-<lb/>ments, like the γ-ray lens MAX, will be better suited to <lb/>attempt this challenging detection (see Hernanz and José, <lb/>2004, [47]). <lb/> 2.4.2 <lb/> 22  Na <lb/> The potential role of <lb/> 22  Na for diagnosis of nova outbursts <lb/>was first suggested by Clayton and Hoyle (1974) [30]. It <lb/>decays to a short-lived excited state of <lb/> 22  Ne (with a life-<lb/>time of τ = 3.75 yr), which de-excites to its ground state <lb/>by emitting a γ-ray photon of 1.275 MeV. Through this <lb/>mechanism, nearby ONe novae may provide detectable <lb/> γ-ray fluxes. Several experimental verifications of this γ-<lb/> ray emission at 1.275 MeV from nearby novae have been <lb/>attempted in the last twenty years, using balloon-borne <lb/>experiments and detectors on-board satellites such as <lb/>HEAO-3, SMM, or CGRO, from which upper limits on <lb/>the ejected <lb/> 22  Na have been derived. In particular, the ob-<lb/>servations performed with the COMPTEL experiment on-<lb/>board CGRO of five recent Ne-type novae as well as obser-<lb/>vations of standard CO novae (Iyudin et al., 1995, [48]), <lb/>have led to an upper limit of 3.7 × 10 <lb/> 8  M   for the <lb/> 22  Na <lb/>mass ejected by any nova in the Galactic disk. A limit that <lb/>poses some constraints on pre-existing theoretical models <lb/>of classical nova explosions. <lb/>Synthesis of <lb/> 22  Na in novae proceeds through differ-<lb/>ent reaction paths. In the <lb/> 20  Ne-enriched envelopes of ONe <lb/>novae (José et al., 1999, [49]), it takes place through <lb/> 20  Ne(p, γ) <lb/> 21  Na, followed either by another proton capture <lb/>and a β <lb/> +  -decay into <lb/> 22  Na (cf., <lb/> 21  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 22  Mg(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 22  Na), <lb/></body>

Other poten-<lb/>tial channels, such as proton captures on the seed nu-<lb/>cleus <lb/> 23  Na, play only a marginal role on <lb/> 22  Na synthe-<lb/>sis because of the much higher initial <lb/> 20  Ne content in <lb/>such ONe models. As for the main destruction channel <lb/>at nova temperatures, <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Mg competes favorably <lb/>with <lb/> 22  Na(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 22  Ne. Until very recently, important nu-<lb/>clear uncertainties affected the rates for <lb/> 21  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 22  Mg <lb/>and <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Mg (José et al., 1999, [49]), which trans-<lb/>lated into an uncertainty in the estimated <lb/> 22  Na yields (and <lb/>ultimately on the maximum detectability distance of the <lb/>associated 1275 keV line). These uncertainties have been <lb/>recently reduced by the first direct measurement of the <lb/> 21  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 22  Mg rate with the DRAGON recoil separator <lb/>facility at TRIUMF (Bishop et al., 2003, [50]; D&apos;Auria et <lb/>al., 2004, [51]; see also the indirect approach by Davids <lb/> et al., 2003, [52]), and by improving the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Mg <lb/>rate through spectroscopies studies of the <lb/> 23  Mg nucleus <lb/>(populated by the reaction <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 12  C, n) <lb/> 23  Mg), carried out <lb/>with Gammasphere at the Argonne National Laboratory <lb/>(Jenkins et al., 2004, [53]). <lb/> 2.4.3 <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> 26  Al was discovered in the interstellar medium by the <lb/>HEAO-3 satellite, through the detection of the 1.809 MeV <lb/> γ-ray line (Mahoney et al., 1982, [54]; 1984 [55]), a proof of <lb/>active Galactic nucleosynthesis. This γ-ray feature is pro-<lb/>duced by the β <lb/> +  -decay (τ = 1.04 Myr) of <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> g  (ground <lb/>state) to the first excited state of <lb/> 26  Mg, which de-excites <lb/>to its ground state by emitting a 1.809 MeV photon. <lb/>The synthesis of <lb/> 26  Al requires moderate peak tempera-<lb/>tures, of the order of 2 × 10 <lb/> 8  K, and a fast decline (Ward <lb/>and Fowler, 1980, [56]), conditions that are achieved in <lb/>typical nova outbursts. A detailed analysis of the way <lb/> 26  Al synthesis proceeds, in the framework of 1D hydro-<lb/>dynamic calculations (José et al., 1997, [57]; 1999 [49]) <lb/>reveals the existence of several &quot; seed &quot; nuclei: in particu-<lb/>lar, <lb/> 24,25  Mg and to some extent <lb/> 23  Na and <lb/> 20,22  Ne. The <lb/>main nuclear reaction path leading to <lb/> 26  Al synthesis is <lb/> 24  Mg(p, α) <lb/> 25  Al(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 25  Mg(p, α) <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> g  , whereas destruction <lb/>is dominated by <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> g  (p, γ) <lb/> 27  Si. <lb/>A question raised during the Nuclear Physics in Astro-<lb/>physics II Workshop concerns the importance of the un-<lb/>certainties associated with <lb/> 25  Mg(p, γ) as compared with <lb/>those significantly affecting the <lb/> 25  Al(p, γ) rate (Coc et <lb/>al., 1995, [58]; José et al., 1999, [49]; see also Rowland <lb/> et al., 2004, [59] for a recent update of the <lb/> 23  Na+p rates <lb/>and their impact on <lb/> 26  Al production in novae): according <lb/>to a recent sensitivity study (Iliadis et al., 2002, [60]) in <lb/>nova nucleosynthesis, the uncertainty associated with the <lb/> 25  Mg(p, γ) rates in the domain of nova nucleosynthesis <lb/>(T = 0.1–0.4 GK) is rather limited (i.e., a factor 0.6–1.8 <lb/>deviation from the nominal rate). Hence, their impact on <lb/>nova nucleosynthesis is negligible (cf., less than a factor <lb/>of ∼ 2 change in the <lb/> 25,26  Mg and <lb/> 26  Al yields. In con-<lb/>trast, the <lb/> 25  Al(p, γ) rate is affecting from a much larger <lb/>uncertainty (a factor 0.01–100 deviation from the nomi-<lb/>nal rate). This huge uncertainty translates into an uncer-<lb/>tainty in the contribution of novae to the Galactic <lb/> 26  Al <lb/>content (since this reaction determines the fraction of the <lb/>nuclear path that proceeds through the isomeric <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> m <lb/> instead), an estimate that relies critically on two ingre-<lb/>dients: the adopted surface composition for ONe white <lb/>dwarfs (i.e., the initial <lb/> 24  Mg abundance), and the specific <lb/>rates adopted for the reactions <lb/> 26  Al <lb/> g  (p, γ) and <lb/> 27  Al(p, α); <lb/> see José et al., 1997, [57]). Whereas calculations per-<lb/>formed by the Arizona group (Starrfield et al., 1986, [61]; <lb/>1998 [13]; 2000 [62]) assume a composition based on hydro-<lb/>static models of C-burning nucleosynthesis (Arnett and <lb/>Truran, 1969, [7]), highly enriched in <lb/> 24  Mg (with a ratio <lb/> 16  O: <lb/> 20  Ne: <lb/> 24  Mg of 1.5:2.5:1), the Barcelona group (José <lb/>and Hernanz, 1998, [14]; José et al., 1997, [57]; 1999 [49]; <lb/>2001 [63]) has adopted more recent estimates from stellar <lb/>evolution calculations of intermediate-mass stars (Ritossa <lb/> et al., 1996, [9]), that result in a much smaller <lb/> 24  Mg con-<lb/>tent (cf., <lb/> 16  O: <lb/> 20  Ne: <lb/> 24  Mg is 10:6:1). Calculations based on <lb/>this new ONe white dwarf composition, with an updated <lb/>nuclear reaction network, suggest that the contribution of <lb/>classical nova outbursts to the Galactic <lb/> 26  Al abundance is <lb/>small (less than ∼ 15%), in agreement with the results de-<lb/>rived from the COMPTEL/CGRO map of the 1.809 MeV <lb/> 26  Al emission in the Galaxy (see Diehl et al., 1995, [64]), <lb/>which points towards young progenitors (type II super-<lb/>novae and Wolf-Rayet stars). <lb/> 2.4.4 <lb/> 13  N-<lb/> 18  F <lb/> The most intense emission predicted in γ-rays for classi-<lb/>cal novae is the 511 keV line and a continuum at lower <lb/>energies with a cut-off due to photoelectric absorption at <lb/>about 20–630 keV. This prompt emission, that lasts only <lb/>for a few hours after T  peak  , is caused by the sudden release <lb/>of positrons from the β <lb/> +  -decay of the short-lived species <lb/> 13  N and <lb/> 18  F, that annihilate with the surrounding elec-<lb/>trons when the envelope is already transparent to γ-rays. <lb/> The detection of this short duration emission is a challenge <lb/>since this takes place before the nova optical discovery, <lb/>which rules out any possibility of a pointed observation. <lb/>Only instruments with a wide field-of-view (e.g., BATSE <lb/>and TGRS) have a chance to discover serendipitously this <lb/>prompt emission, provided that they were pointing at the <lb/>right place at the right time. Several attempts have been <lb/>carried out to detect these γ-ray signatures from classical <lb/>novae, from which only upper limits on the <lb/> 18  F annihila-<lb/>tion line were obtained. Detectability distance estimates <lb/>of the 511 keV line with the INTEGRAL&apos;s spectrometer <lb/>SPI and of the continuum with the INTEGRAL&apos;s imager <lb/>IBIS are about 4 kpc (for 10 h of observation; see Hernanz <lb/> et al., 1999, [33]; Hernanz and José, 2004, [47]). However, <lb/>the limited field-of-view of these instruments make this <lb/>detection unlikely.

Indeed, spectroscopic abundance de-<lb/>terminations of nova shells include silicon (Nova Aql 1982, <lb/>QU Vul 1984), sulfur (Nova Aql 1982), chlorine (Nova GQ <lb/>Mus 1983), argon and calcium (Nova GQ Mus 1983, Nova <lb/>V2214 Oph 1988, Nova V977 Sco 1989 and Nova V443 <lb/>Sct 1989), whereas no indication of a significant overpro-<lb/>duction with respect to solar abundances has been ever <lb/>reported for elements above Ca. It is worth mentioning <lb/>that this conclusion relies on the fact that the temper-<lb/>atures attained in the envelope during the explosion are <lb/>limited to T  peak  &lt; 4 × 10 <lb/> 8  K. <lb/>The nuclear activity in the Si-Ca region has been <lb/>scarcely analyzed in detail in the context of classical <lb/>nova outbursts (see Starrfield et al., 1998, [13]; Iliadis <lb/> et al., 1999, [70]; Wanajo et al., 1999, [71], and José <lb/> et al., 2001, [63]). It is powered by a leakage from the <lb/>NeNa-MgAl region, where the activity is confined dur-<lb/>ing the early stages of the explosion (see Rowland et <lb/>al., 2004, [59] for a recent paper on the lack of a closed <lb/>NeNa-cycle in nova conditions). The main reaction that <lb/>drives the nuclear activity towards heavier species (i.e., <lb/>beyond S) is mainly <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) <lb/> 31  S, either followed by <lb/> 31  S(p, γ) <lb/> 32  Cl(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 32  S, or by <lb/> 31  S(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 31  P(p, γ) <lb/> 32  S (José et <lb/>al., 2001, [63]). The current <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) <lb/> 31  S rate is based on <lb/>Hauser-Feshbach estimates, which can be rather uncertain <lb/>at the domain of nova temperatures. To test the effect of <lb/>this uncertainty on the predicted yields, a series of hy-<lb/>drodynamic calculations has been performed (José et al., <lb/> 2001, [63]), modifying arbitrarily the nominal rate. Hence, <lb/>for a high <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) <lb/> 31  S rate (i.e., 100 times the nominal <lb/>one), the final <lb/> 30  Si yields are dramatically reduced by a <lb/>factor of 30, whereas for a low <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) <lb/> 31  S rate (i.e., 0.01 <lb/>times the nominal one), the final <lb/> 30  Si yields are slightly <lb/>increased by a factor of 5, whereas isotopes above silicon <lb/>are reduced by a factor of ∼ 10, with a dramatic impact <lb/>on estimates of the composition of the ejecta and of the <lb/>chemical pattern of meteoritic grains to be condensed in <lb/>the ejected shells. Attempts to reduce the uncertainty as-<lb/>sociated with this rate are currently in progress at several <lb/>nuclear physics facilities, including ORNL (Oak Ridge), <lb/>ANL (Argonne), and JYFL (University of Jyväskylä). In <lb/>particular, a <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 20  Ne, n) <lb/> 31  S experiment to study proton-<lb/>unbound levels in <lb/> 31  S has been performed in ANL with <lb/>gammasphere, with the goal to determine their corre-<lb/>sponding spins and parities (see Jenkins et al., 2005, [72]). <lb/> 3 X-ray bursts <lb/> Accretion onto neutron stars in close binary systems can <lb/>also give rise to some nova-like events known as X-ray <lb/>bursts. Because of the stronger surface gravity in a neutron <lb/>star (as compared with that of a white dwarf), tempera-<lb/>tures and densities in the accreted envelope during X-ray <lb/>bursts are typically an order of magnitude greater than in <lb/>a typical nova outburst (see pioneering models by Woosley <lb/>and Taam, 1976, [73]; Joss, 1977, [74], and Maraschi and <lb/>Cavaliere, 1977, [75]). As a result, detailed nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis studies involve several hundreds of isotopes (up to the <lb/>so-called SnSbTe cycle. See Schatz et al., 2001, [76]) and <lb/>thousands of nuclear reactions. Indeed, the main reaction <lb/>flow moves far away from the valley of stability, and even <lb/>merges with the proton drip line beyond A = 38 (Schatz <lb/> et al., 1999, [77]). Until recently, because of computa-<lb/>tional limitations, many simulations of X-ray bursts were <lb/>performed in the framework of reduced nuclear reaction <lb/>networks. Examples include network endpoints around <lb/>Ni (Woosley and Wallace, 1984, [78]; Taam, 1993, [79]; <lb/>Taam, 1996, [80]), Ga (José and Moreno, 2003, [81]), Se <lb/>(Hanawa et al., 1983, [82]), Kr (Koike et al., 1999, [83]), <lb/>or Y (Wallace and Woosley, 1981, [84]). Indeed, Wallace <lb/>and Woosley (1984) [85] reached <lb/> 96  Cd, but in the con-<lb/>text of a reduced 16-nuclei network. On the other hand, <lb/>Schatz et al. (1999) [77], (2001) [76] have carried out very <lb/>detailed nucleosynthesis calculations, with a complete re-<lb/>action network up to the SnSbTe mass region, but using <lb/>a simple one-zone approach. Similar criticism can be ap-<lb/>plied to other works, such as Moreno et al. (2001) [86], <lb/>that reached Pd, and Koike et al. (2004) [87], whose net-<lb/>work extended up to Bi. Recent hydrodynamic simula-<lb/>tions with a reasonably extended network containing 298 <lb/>isotopes (up to Te) have been performed by Fisker et <lb/>al. (2004) [88]. An unprecedented attempt, coupling de-<lb/>tailed hydrodynamic stellar models in one-dimension with <lb/>a complete nuclear reaction network (up to 1300 isotopes, <lb/>in the framework of an adaptive network) has been re-<lb/>cently performed by Woosley et al. (2004) [89]. <lb/> 3.1 Nucleosynthesis in X-ray bursts <lb/> Contrary to classical novae, where the main nuclear activ-<lb/>ity is driven by proton-capture reactions in competition <lb/>with β <lb/> +  -decays, X-ray bursts are triggered by a combi-<lb/>nation of nuclear reactions, including H-burning (via rp-<lb/>process) and He-burning (that initiates with the triple <lb/></body>

			<body> α-reaction, and is followed both by the breakout of the <lb/>CNO cycle by <lb/> 14,15  O + α, plus a competition of proton <lb/>captures and (α, p) reactions —the so-called αp-process). <lb/> Initially, the CNO breakout is led by <lb/> 15  O(α, γ) <lb/> 19  Ne (see <lb/>Fisker et al., 2005, [90] for a recent study of the impact of <lb/>the <lb/> 15  O(α, γ) rate on the bursting behavior of an accret-<lb/>ing neutron star), which is followed by two consecutive <lb/>proton-captures through <lb/> 20  Na and <lb/> 21  Mg, where the flow <lb/>faces strong photodisintegration reactions on <lb/> 22  Al. Follow-<lb/>ing <lb/> 21  Mg-decay, they flow shifts through <lb/> 21  Na(p, γ) <lb/> 22  Mg <lb/>(see D&apos;Auria et al., 2004, [51] for a recent update of this <lb/>rate for X-ray bursts conditions). As the temperature <lb/>rises, and enough <lb/> 14  O is built up through the triple-α re-<lb/>action, followed by <lb/> 12  C(p, γ) <lb/> 13  N(p, γ) <lb/> 14  O, an alternative <lb/>path through <lb/> 14  O(α, p) <lb/> 17  F reaction dominates the flow <lb/>(see Champagne and Wiescher, 1992, [91], and Woosley et <lb/>al., 2004, [89]), by-passing the <lb/> 15  O(α, γ) <lb/> 19  Ne link to <lb/> 21  Na <lb/>through <lb/> 17  F(p, γ) <lb/> 18  Ne(α, p) <lb/> 21  Na, where <lb/> 18  Ne(α, p) <lb/> 21  Na <lb/>represents the main path towards heavier species. The <lb/>rates for these breakout reactions have huge associated <lb/>uncertainties (see Görres et al., 1995, [92], and Mao et al., <lb/> 1996, [93]) and are subject to intense experimental studies <lb/>both at stable and radioactive beam facilities. Of special <lb/>interest is the fact that H-burning continues after the peak <lb/>of the explosion through the rp-process, which extends the <lb/>main path much beyond <lb/> 56  Ni, up to the SnSbTe region <lb/>(see Fisker et al., 2005, [90] for a detailed account of the <lb/>main nuclear paths at different stages of the TNR). <lb/>A major drawback in the modeling of X-ray bursts <lb/>comes from the lack of observational nucleosynthetic con-<lb/>straints (beyond obvious implications for the physics of <lb/>the neutron star crusts). This results from the difficulty <lb/>of ejection in the strong gravitational well of a neutron <lb/>star. A recent attempt to overcome this limitation has <lb/>been provided by high-resolution spectra obtained with <lb/>XMM-Newton (Cottam et al., 2002, [94]) that bring an <lb/>insight into the chemical species present in the envelope <lb/>at different epochs (determinations include C, N, O, Ne, <lb/>or Fe, with different degrees of ionization; see also Chang <lb/> et al., 2005, [95] for a very recent study on formation of <lb/>resonant atomic lines during X-ray bursts). <lb/>It is important to stress that, contrary to nova out-<lb/>bursts, convection is not that critical in the progress of <lb/>the TNR for X-ray bursts. This can be tested by artifi-<lb/>cially turning-off convective transport in a series of nu-<lb/>merical tests: whereas convection is the key ingredient to <lb/>power the expansion and ejection stages in a nova out-<lb/>burst (through the transport of the short-lived species <lb/> 13  N, <lb/> 14,15  O and <lb/> 17  F), an X-ray burst is not deeply affected <lb/>by the lack of convection. Indeed, recent X-ray burst mod-<lb/>els (Woosley et al., 2004, [89]) point out that convection <lb/>sets in during a very short time (of the order of a few <lb/>seconds). <lb/> 3.2 Future challenges: superbursts <lb/> Whereas regular, type I X-ray bursts exhibit some com-<lb/>mon features in terms of duration, energetics, and recur-<lb/>rence times, a few extremely energetic events have been <lb/>recently reported thanks to better performances in mon-<lb/>itoring achieved with X-ray satellites (i.e., BeppoSAX, <lb/>Chandra, or XMM-Newton). The first observation of a <lb/> superburst was reported by Cornelisse et al. (2000) [96] <lb/>in the context of a &quot; common &quot; type I bursting source (cf., <lb/>the BeppoSAX source 4U 1735 -44). Several other sources <lb/>have been identified since then, including 4U 1636 -53 for <lb/>which two superbursts have been reported already. <lb/>According to their distinctive characteristics, super-<lb/>bursts represent some sort of extreme X-ray bursts: they <lb/>have long duration, with a typical (exponential) decay <lb/>time ranging from 1 to 3 hours (including an extreme case, <lb/>KS 1731 -260, which lasted for more than 10 hours. See <lb/>Kuulkers et al., 2002, [97] for details), extremely energetic <lb/>(about ∼ 1000 times more than a typical X-ray burst), and <lb/>with much longer recurrence periods (4.7 yr for the sys-<lb/>tem 4U 1636 -53, the only one in which two superbursts <lb/>have been observed to date. See Wijnands, 2001, [98]). <lb/>Indeed, the durations and energetics of superbursts sug-<lb/>gest that they result from thermonuclear flashes occurring <lb/>in fuel layers at much greater depth than for typical X-<lb/>ray bursts, more likely, in the C-rich ashes resulting from <lb/>type I X-ray bursts (Cumming and Bildsten, 2001, [99]. <lb/>See also Woosley and Taam, 1976, [73]; Taam and Pick-<lb/>lum, 1978, [100], and Brown and Bildsten, 1998, [101]). <lb/>Controversy remains as how much carbon is left after a <lb/>type I burst: Schatz et al. (1999) [77], (2001) [76] have <lb/>indeed shown than most of the C is burnt during the <lb/>previous H/He burning. However, Cumming and Bildsten <lb/>(2001) [99] concluded that even small amounts of carbon <lb/>are enough to power a superburst (especially in neutron <lb/>star oceans enriched from the heavy ashes driven by the <lb/>rp-process). More theoretical efforts to test these ideas are <lb/>required to shed light into this question. <lb/> 4 Outlook <lb/> A final comment on nuclear physics input requirements <lb/>as well as on reaction rates that need to be improved to <lb/>overcome their huge associated uncertainties: the situa-<lb/>tion concerning nova modeling is quite well defined. Sig-<lb/>nificant experimental information is already available and <lb/>we are confident that, in the near future, novae will be-<lb/>come the first explosive stellar site for which most (if not <lb/>all) of the relevant nuclear physics input will be primar-<lb/>ily based on experimental information. Main uncertainties <lb/>are localized in only a handful of nuclear reaction rates <lb/>(namely, <lb/> 18  F(p, α), <lb/> 25  Al(p, γ) and <lb/> 30  P(p, γ)), for which <lb/>several experiments have been already proposed in dif-<lb/>ferent facilities. <lb/>In contrast, the situation is much more complex as re-<lb/>gards X-ray bursts: nuclear physics requirements include <lb/>mass measurements along the rp-process path (see Clark <lb/> et al., 2004, [102] for a recent mass determination for <lb/> 68  Se), <lb/>and a much better knowledge of key reactions and effective <lb/>lifetimes at the waiting points (in particular, <lb/> 30  S(α, p) and <lb/> 34  Ar(α, p); see Fisker et al., 2004, [88]) under rp-process <lb/>conditions. However, it is important to stress that, far <lb/>from the waiting points, the situation is not well settled. <lb/></body>

			<body>Received: 24 June 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 24 February 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. Conventionally, reaction rates relevant to nova nucleosynthesis are determined by performing <lb/>the relevant proton capture reactions directly for stable species, or as has become possible more recently in <lb/>inverse kinematics using short-lived accelerated radioactive beams with recoil separators. A secondary ap-<lb/>proach is to compile information on the properties of levels in the Gamow window using transfer reactions. <lb/>We present a complementary technique where the states of interest are populated in a heavy-ion fusion <lb/>reaction and their gamma decay studied with a state-of-the-art array of high-purity germanium detectors. <lb/>The advantages of this approach, including the ability to determine resonance energies with high precision <lb/>and the possibility of determining spins and parities from gamma-ray angular distributions are discussed. <lb/>Two specific examples related to the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) and <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) reactions are presented. <lb/> PACS. 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive environments – 21.10.Tg Life-<lb/>times – 27.30.+t 20 ≤ A ≤ 38 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Two key issues relating to nova nucleosynthesis have been <lb/>recently identified. The former pertains to the probability <lb/>of making direct observation of nova explosions through <lb/>the detection of gamma rays following the beta decay of <lb/>certain nuclear species produced in the explosion such as <lb/> 22  Na and <lb/> 26  Al [1]. In this respect, <lb/> 22  Na which decays, with <lb/>a 2.602 y half-life, into a short-lived excited state of <lb/> 22  Ne, <lb/>emitting a 1.275 MeV γ-ray, is seen as a particularly im-<lb/>portant diagnostic of nova explosions with the expectation <lb/>that explosions within a few kiloparsecs of the Sun might <lb/>provide detectable γ-ray fluxes associated with <lb/> 22  Na de-<lb/>cay. Efforts are ongoing to detect such cosmic γ-rays, in <lb/>particular, with the recently launched ESA INTEGRAL <lb/>mission [2]. In order to understand the likelihood of de-<lb/>tecting cosmic gamma rays from <lb/> 22  Na, it is important to <lb/>quantify the processes responsible for the production and <lb/>destruction of <lb/> 22  Na in nova nucleosynthesis. Uncertainties <lb/>in the rate of production of <lb/> 22  Na have largely been lifted <lb/> a  e-mail: dj4@york.ac.uk <lb/> by a study of the <lb/> 21  Na(p, γ) employing a radioactive <lb/> 21  Na <lb/>beam in inverse kinematics [3] <lb/> 1  . Prior to the work de-<lb/>scribed here, there was rather more significant uncertainty <lb/>in the destruction rate via the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) reaction. <lb/>A second area of inquiry is the location of the endpoint <lb/>for nova nucleosynthesis. Jose has identified the <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) <lb/> reaction as being the key determinant in this respect [5]. <lb/>This reaction rate is determined on the basis of Hauser-<lb/>Feshbach calculations as no relevant experimental mea-<lb/>surements have been made. It is not known how reliable <lb/>such a methodology might be in this case since the level <lb/>density may not be high enough to make the necessary as-<lb/>sumptions about the availability of suitable resonances in <lb/>the Gamow window. Jose has shown that plausible vari-<lb/>ances in the reaction rate by a factor of 100 up or down <lb/>have dramatic consequences for the endpoint of nova nu-<lb/>cleosynthesis [5]. <lb/></body>

Strong transitions in <lb/> 23  Mg are <lb/>labelled with their energy in keV. <lb/> 2 Example 1: <lb/> 22 Na(p, γ) <lb/> In the past, several methods have been employed in order <lb/>to obtain the astrophysical reaction rate for the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) <lb/> reaction [6,7,8,9]. The key to such an analysis is a detailed <lb/>knowledge of properties such as the excitation energy, spin <lb/>and parity of levels in the unbound region. The conven-<lb/>tional approach to this problem is to study the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) <lb/> directly by bombarding a specially prepared radioactive <lb/> 22  Na target with protons and detecting the γ-rays follow-<lb/>ing proton capture [6,7]. We have pursued a complemen-<lb/>tary approach in which particle-unbound states were pop-<lb/>ulated in a heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reaction and their <lb/>subsequent γ decay investigated with Gammasphere, a 4π <lb/>high resolution γ-ray spectrometer consisting of 100 large-<lb/>volume, high-purity germanium detectors comprising a to-<lb/>tal efficiency of around 9% for 1.33 MeV γ-rays [10]. This <lb/>work is reported in more detail elsewhere [11]. <lb/>A 10 pnA beam of <lb/> 12  C was accelerated to 22 MeV by <lb/>the ATLAS accelerator at Argonne National Laboratory <lb/>and was incident on a 40 μg/cm <lb/> 2  thick <lb/> 12  C target. The <lb/>resulting gamma decay was detected using the Gamma-<lb/>sphere array. The fusion channels observed were single-<lb/>proton, neutron or alpha emission leading to <lb/> 23  Na, <lb/> 23  Mg <lb/>and <lb/> 20  Na, respectively. A γ-γ matrix and a γ-γ-γ cube <lb/>were produced and analysed to obtain information on the <lb/>decay schemes. The construction of the decay schemes was <lb/>straightforward given the small number of residual nuclei <lb/>produced and their well-known decay schemes at low exci-<lb/>tation energies [12]. An example of the quality of the data <lb/>obtained is given in fig. 1. <lb/>It is worthwhile to reflect that large γ-ray spectrome-<lb/>ters are most commonly designed for the study of excited <lb/>states of heavy nuclei where high-multiplicity cascades <lb/>(∼ 20 photons) and relatively low energies (∼ 1 MeV) are <lb/>expected. By contrast, for the astrophysical application <lb/>described here, the relevant cascades have both a rela-<lb/>tively low multiplicity and γ-ray energies which may be <lb/>above 10 MeV, meaning that particular attention needs <lb/>to be paid to both energy and efficiency calibrations. <lb/>In obtaining accurate γ-ray energies, we have applied <lb/>a correction for the non-linearity of the array as well as <lb/>the finite recoil correction for large-energy γ-rays emitted <lb/>from a light nucleus. In cases where two coincident transi-<lb/>tions were crossed over by a third transition, the corrected <lb/>energy sum was compared and found to be in agreement <lb/>at the ∼ 0.5–1 keV level. <lb/>In order to assign a multipolarity to the observed tran-<lb/>sitions, a matrix was generated of γ-rays detected at all <lb/>angles against those detected at 90 <lb/> •  and a matrix of all <lb/> γ-rays against those detected at 32 <lb/> •  and 37 <lb/> •  . The ra-<lb/>tio (R  DCO  ) of the intensities of transitions in these two <lb/>matrices when gating on the &quot; all detector &quot; axis was ex-<lb/>tracted. This ratio was around 0.9(1) for pure dipole tran-<lb/>sitions and around 1.7(2) for pure quadrupole transitions. <lb/>Mixed M 1/E2 dipole transitions may have various val-<lb/>ues depending on the value of the mixing ratio. As well <lb/>as angular correlations, it was also possible to assign the <lb/>spin/parity of states in <lb/> 23  Mg, on the basis of their simi-<lb/>larity in both energy and decay path to analogue states of <lb/>well-established spin and parity in <lb/> 23  Na [12], for which ex-<lb/>tensive additional spectroscopic information was obtained. <lb/>The high energy of many of the γ-rays observed im-<lb/>plies very short (femtosecond) lifetimes which are readily <lb/>extracted using the fractional Doppler-shift technique [13] <lb/>since it may reasonably be assumed for high-lying, un-<lb/>bound states that the feeding is direct. Seven matrices <lb/>were sorted containing un-Doppler–corrected gamma-ray <lb/>energies observed at 32 <lb/> •  , 50 <lb/> •  , 80 <lb/> •  , 90 <lb/> •  , 100 <lb/> •  , 130 <lb/> •  and <lb/>148 <lb/> •  , respectively, against Doppler-corrected energies ob-<lb/>served at any angle. The peak centroids were obtained for <lb/>a transition at all seven angles when gated on a transi-<lb/>tion on the Doppler-corrected &quot; all detector &quot; axis. This <lb/>was used to calculate the observed Doppler shift and, <lb/>hence, the fractional Doppler shift relative to the cal-<lb/>culated maximum Doppler shift for the given beam and <lb/>target. A model prescription was used to relate the frac-<lb/>tional Doppler shift to the lifetime of the parent state. <lb/>The gamma width of the state may be deduced from the <lb/>lifetime. <lb/> 2.1 Re-evaluation of the reaction rate <lb/> The Gammasphere array affords the possibility of deter-<lb/>mining the energy of the resonances to higher accuracy <lb/>than that obtainable with a spectrometer. It also allows <lb/>their decay path to be observed and through angular-<lb/>distribution measurements, the spin/parity of these res-<lb/>onances may be inferred or at least restricted to some <lb/>plausible range. The γ-ray energies, angular-correlation <lb/>ratios, and lifetimes of proton-unbound states in <lb/> 23  Mg are <lb/>presented in table 1. <lb/>The resonance strengths were taken from the literature <lb/>where known [14], or else were calculated from measured <lb/>spectroscopic factors and calculated single-particle proton <lb/>widths. The resonance strength for a state with spin, J, <lb/> is given by <lb/> ωγ = ω <lb/>Γ  p  Γ  γ <lb/> Γ  p  + Γ  γ <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/></body>

The results of this analysis <lb/>are presented in fig. 2. The changes to the reaction rate <lb/>with respect to the compilation in the literature [14] have <lb/>two principal origins. Firstly, we have fully constrained <lb/>the spin and parity of the two near-threshold resonances <lb/>showing that they are associated with l = 2 rather than <lb/> l = 0 and hence, their contribution at lower tempera-<lb/>tures will be lower than previously thought. Second, we <lb/>have identified an additional state in the Gamow window <lb/>at E  p  (lab) = 198 keV, which mirror symmetry considera-<lb/>tions suggest may have J <lb/> π  = 9/2 <lb/> −  . If this state did have <lb/>this spin/parity, then it might, in principle, make a sub-<lb/>stantial contribution to the overall reaction rate. The con-<lb/>tribution is, however, constrained by limited direct mea-<lb/>surements made previously. We set an upper limit on the <lb/>resonance strength for this new state of 4 meV. Clearly, it <lb/>is a priority to determine the resonance strength of this <lb/>state more precisely and further measurements are war-<lb/>ranted. <lb/> 2.2 Astrophysical implications <lb/> An analysis of the impact of the new rate for the <lb/> 22  Na(p, γ) reaction on the amount of <lb/> 22  Na ejected dur-<lb/>ing nova outbursts has been performed. An evolutionary <lb/>sequence for a nova outburst hosting an ONe white dwarf <lb/>of 1.25 M   , has been computed by means of a spherically <lb/>symmetric, hydrodynamic, implicit code, in Lagrangian <lb/>formulation, extensively used in the modeling of such ex-<lb/>plosions (see ref. [15] for details). If the resonance strength <lb/>of the newly discovered state were to tend to its upper <lb/>limit, then this would represent a reduction by roughly <lb/>a factor of two in terms of the maximum detectability <lb/>distance for the 1.275 MeV γ-ray from <lb/> 22  Na. This would <lb/>have important implications for ongoing satellite-based <lb/>searches for gamma rays from novae such as the ESA IN-<lb/>TEGRAL mission. <lb/> 3 Example 2: <lb/> 30 P(p, γ) <lb/> We have employed a similar methodology in our approach <lb/>to improving the experimental situation for states in the <lb/>Gamow window in <lb/> 31  S relevant to the <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) reaction. <lb/>Excited states in <lb/> 31  P and <lb/> 31  S were produced at the same <lb/> 120 <lb/> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> 0 <lb/> 200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1500 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2500 <lb/>3000 <lb/>3500 <lb/>4000 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/> 3042 <lb/> 3285 <lb/> 1532 <lb/> 1949 <lb/> 3953 <lb/> 1234 <lb/> 3040 <lb/> 1928 <lb/> 1481 <lb/> 1219 <lb/> P <lb/>S <lb/> 31 <lb/>31 <lb/> 3380 <lb/> 3703 <lb/> 3622 <lb/> 2761 <lb/> 2724 <lb/> 1004 <lb/> 1884 <lb/> 1110 <lb/> 989 <lb/> Fig. 3. The top spectrum shows transitions above the 7/2 <lb/> + <lb/> level in <lb/> 31  P and is double-gated by the 1266 and 2148 keV <lb/>transitions in the γ-γ-γ cube. The bottom spectrum contains <lb/>transitions above the 7/2 <lb/> +  level in <lb/> 31  S and is double-gated by <lb/>the 1249 and 2102 keV transitions in the γ-γ-γ cube. Mirror <lb/>transitions of interest are labelled with their energies in keV. <lb/> time through the <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 20  Ne, p) and <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 20  Ne, n) reactions <lb/>using a 32 MeV beam from the ATLAS accelerator at Ar-<lb/>gonne National Laboratory. The resulting gamma decays <lb/>were detected by Gammasphere [10]. Transitions in <lb/> 31  S <lb/>were rigorously identified by selecting <lb/> 31  S recoils using the <lb/>Fragment Mass Analyser (FMA) [16] and an ion chamber. <lb/>This information was used in conjunction with a γ-γ ma-<lb/>trix and a γ-γ-γ cube to develop level schemes for the two <lb/>nuclei. An angular-correlation analysis was performed for <lb/>the strongest gamma rays observed. <lb/>We were able to very cleanly identify the strongest <lb/>transitions in <lb/> 31  S when we demanded that the separated <lb/>recoils had A = 31 and Z = 16. The statistics did not <lb/>allow, however, the identification of weak or high-energy <lb/> γ-rays which might be feeding the ground state, given the <lb/>very low coincident efficiency. In order to develop the level <lb/>scheme, we exploited the γ-ray coincidence data, which <lb/>did not have a condition on the detection of <lb/> 31  S residues. <lb/>The analysis is, therefore, complicated by the presence of <lb/>transitions with near identical energy in other nuclei which <lb/>were more strongly populated in the experiment. For ex-<lb/>ample, the first 5/2 <lb/> +  state in <lb/> 31  S decays by a 2236 keV <lb/> γ-ray, which is near degenerate with strong transitions in <lb/>both <lb/> 31  P and <lb/> 30  Si, and so it is useless for a γ-γ analy-<lb/>sis. We were able, however, to find clean gating conditions <lb/>to observe transitions feeding the 3/2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  , 5/2 <lb/> + <lb/>2  , 7/2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  and <lb/>7/2 <lb/> − <lb/> 1  levels in <lb/> 31  S. An example of the quality of the data <lb/>obtained, as well as an illustration of the close mirror sym-<lb/>metry of <lb/> 31  S and <lb/> 31  P is given in fig. 3. <lb/>A re-evaluation of the <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) reaction rate is <lb/>presently being prepared for publication. Essentially, we <lb/>have identified many of the states in the Gamow window <lb/>in <lb/> 31  S, in particular, those with high spin. These are not <lb/>directly relevant to the proton capture reaction. However, <lb/>with these states eliminated from the analysis, it becomes <lb/>possible to make a one-to-one matching of the remain-<lb/>ing levels with their known mirror counterparts in <lb/> 31  P. <lb/>Taken together with calculations of proton spectroscopic <lb/>factors for the sd shell model states, this allows many of <lb/>the uncertainties in the reaction rate to be strongly re-<lb/>duced. A very important feature of this analysis has been <lb/>the occurrence of striking mirror energy shifts between <lb/>certain states in <lb/> 31  S and <lb/> 31  P, most notably for particular <lb/>negative-parity states such as the first 9/2 <lb/> −  and 13/2 <lb/> − <lb/> levels. These mirror energy shifts are found, in some cases, <lb/>to exceed 250 keV. It is believed that these shifts arise <lb/>from the effects of the electromagnetic spin orbit inter-<lb/>action and their origin is discussed elsewhere [17]. These <lb/>mirror energy shifts are by no means universal and appear <lb/>to occur only for particularly pure stretched configura-<lb/>tions —negligible energy shifts are observed between the <lb/>first 7/2 <lb/> −  and 11/2 <lb/> −  levels, for example [17]. The under-<lb/>standing of nuclear structure effects such as these mirror <lb/>energy shifts is therefore very important in determining <lb/>the <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) reaction rate. <lb/> 3.1 Outlook for future measurements <lb/> We have considerably improved the experimental infor-<lb/>mation for unbound states in <lb/> 31  S. From the present mea-<lb/>surements and careful comparisons with mirror states, <lb/>there are no ambiguities on spin/parity assignments for <lb/>the near-threshold resonances whose proton widths prin-<lb/>cipally determine the reaction rate at lower temperatures. <lb/>The uncertainties now rest principally in the excitation en-<lb/>ergy of the unmeasured resonances, which are 10–15 keV <lb/>as determined in transfer reactions, and the unknown <lb/>spectroscopic factors for low-spin negative-parity states <lb/>in the Gamow window. The latter are very difficult to <lb/>calculate since it would be necessary to have a full sd-<lb/>pf shell model calculation. It would, therefore, be fun-<lb/>damentally difficult to improve on the measurement de-<lb/>scribed here. The best approach would be to measure <lb/>the <lb/> 30  P(p, γ) reaction directly —in particular for low-spin <lb/>negative-parity resonances. This would be a challenging <lb/>measurement given the difficulty in producing a beam of <lb/> 30  P using the ISOL technique, though &quot; in-flight &quot; produc-<lb/>tion via the <lb/> 30  Si(p, n) reaction may be possible. Given a <lb/>modest radioactive beam of ∼ 10 <lb/> 6  s <lb/> −1  , a ( <lb/> 3  He, d) reaction <lb/>could be performed to measure spectroscopic factors for <lb/>these states. The inaccurate spectroscopic factors are not, <lb/>however, the only source of error since the error in the res-<lb/>onance energies must also be considered.

			<body>Received: 17 June 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 13 March 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. Analyzing the Solar System abundance, we have found two universal scaling laws concerning <lb/>the p-and s-nuclei with the same atomic number. They are evidence of the p-nucleus origin that has <lb/>been discussed for long years. The first scaling is the correlation of the isotope abundances between a <lb/>p-nucleus and an s-nucleus that is two neutron heavier than the p-nucleus. The abundance ratios of the <lb/>s-nucleus to the p-nucleus are almost constant in a wide range of atomic numbers. This scaling indicates <lb/>that the p-nucleus is dominantly produced from the s-nucleus by (γ, n) reactions in huge photon bath <lb/>in supernova explosions. The second scaling indicates that the isotope abundance ratio between two p-<lb/>nuclei with the same atomic number is almost unity. These two scalings are a new useful method to verify <lb/>nucleosynthesis models for the p-process. We have calculated these ratios by a p-process nucleosynthesis <lb/>based on a typical core-collapse supernova explosion model. The results are consistent with the scaling in <lb/>the solar abundances. In addition, the scalings provide new concepts: a universality of the p-process, a rate <lb/>meter for the s-process and a new nuclear cosmochronometer. <lb/> PACS. 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae and other explosive environments – 98.80.Ft Origin, <lb/>formation, and abundances of the elements – 91.65.Dt Isotopic composition/chemistry <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Light elements such as H, He were mainly produced by <lb/>Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and heavy elements were dom-<lb/>inantly synthesized by stellar nucleosynthesis after the <lb/>formation of the Galaxy. The Solar System was formed <lb/>from the interstellar medium (ISM), whose composition <lb/>is provided from stellar nucleosynthesis episodes. The So-<lb/>lar System abundance is, therefore, an important record <lb/>of stellar nucleosynthesis and the galactic chemical evolu-<lb/>tion (GCE). About 99% of elements heavier then the iron <lb/>group were produced by two different neutron-capture re-<lb/>action chains, i.e. the slow neutron-capture process (s-<lb/>process) along the β-stability line, and the rapid neutron-<lb/>capture process (r-process) in the neutron-rich side. The <lb/>Solar System abundance shows specific indication that <lb/>they have actually happened before the Solar System for-<lb/>mation. The first evidence is the pairs of two abundance <lb/>peaks near the neutron magic numbers N = 50, 82, 126. <lb/>These two peaks correspond to the s-and r-processes [1]. <lb/>The second evidence for the s-process is an empirical rela-<lb/> a  e-mail: hayakawa.takehito@jaea.go.jp <lb/> tion, N ·σ ∼ constant, where N and σ are, respectively, the <lb/>solar abundance and the neutron capture cross-section [2, <lb/>3]. However, there are stable isotopes that cannot be syn-<lb/>thesized by the neutron capture reactions because they <lb/>are located in the neutron-deficient side of the β-stability <lb/> line in the nuclear chart (see fig. 1). These isotopes are <lb/>called the &quot; p-nuclei &quot; . They have the feature that their iso-<lb/>tope abundances are very rare (typically 0.1%–1%). The <lb/>anti-correlation between the photodisintegration reaction <lb/>rates and the solar abundances for the p-nuclei has been <lb/>pointed out [4]. Nevertheless, their origin has long been <lb/>discussed with many possible nuclear reactions, and their <lb/>astrophysical sites have not been identified uniquely. The <lb/>proposed nuclear processes are the rapid proton capture <lb/>reactions in novae and type-I X-ray bursts in neutron stars <lb/>(rp-process) [5,6], the proton-induced reactions by galac-<lb/>tic cosmic rays [7], the photodisintegration reactions in <lb/>supernova (SN) explosions (γ-process or p-process) [4,8, <lb/>9,10,11,12], and the neutrino-induced reactions in SN ex-<lb/>plosions (ν-process) [13,14]. The origin of the p-nuclei is <lb/>crucial to our understanding of how the Solar System ma-<lb/>terial formed and evolved. We here report two empirical <lb/>scaling laws obtained from a careful analysis of the Solar <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1. Partial nuclear chart around the Xe and Ba isotopes. <lb/>The nuclei located on the β-stability line are mainly synthe-<lb/>sized by the s-and r-processes. In contrast, p-nuclei such as <lb/> 130,132  Ba and <lb/> 136,138  Ce are synthesized by the p-process. There <lb/>are pairs of a p-nucleus and an s-nucleus that are two neutron <lb/>heavier than the p-nucleus. We find a strong correlation be-<lb/>tween the solar abundances of these p-and s-nuclei. <lb/> System abundance [12], and discuss new concepts of &quot; the <lb/>universality of the p-process &quot; and the rate meter for the <lb/>s-process. We also calculate the p-process nucleosynthesis <lb/>using a typical type-II SN model. <lb/> 2 Analyzing the solar abundances and <lb/>discovery of the first scaling <lb/> There are thirty-five p-nuclei in nature. Most p-nuclei are <lb/>even-even nuclei consisting of even protons and even neu-<lb/>trons. There are 22 pairs of a p-nucleus and an almost <lb/>pure s-nucleus that are two neutron heavier than the p-<lb/>nucleus. The pure s-nuclei are dominantly synthesized by <lb/>the s-process and shielded by stable isobars against the <lb/> β <lb/> −  -decay after the freezeout of the r-process. Figure 1 <lb/>shows a partial nuclear chart in the Xe-Ba region. A typ-<lb/>ical example is found in Ba isotopes: <lb/> 132  Ba is a p-nucleus <lb/>and <lb/> 134  Ba is a pure s-nucleus shielded by an isobar <lb/> 134  Xe <lb/>against the β-decay. <lb/> We here discuss the isotope abundance ratios of these <lb/>two isotopes. Taking the abundance ratio of the s-nucleus <lb/>to the p-nucleus, N (s)/N (p), where N (s) and N (p) means <lb/>the solar abundances of the s-and p-nucleus, respectively, <lb/>we find a clear correlation between them (see fig. 2). The <lb/>ratios are almost constant and constrained at a constant <lb/>value of N (s)/N (p) ≈ 23 in a wide region of atomic num-<lb/>bers except for the deviations. The reason for the devia-<lb/>tions will be discussed later. This scaling has never been <lb/>recognized in the literature quantitatively. <lb/>The first scaling shows a strong correlation between <lb/>p-and s-nuclei with the same atomic number, which in-<lb/>dicates that the origin of the p-nuclei is strongly corre-<lb/>lated with the s-nuclei.

Abundance ratios of pure s-nucleus to pure p-<lb/>nucleus, N (s)/N (p), in the Solar System. The p-nucleus is <lb/>a two-neutron–deficient isotope from an s-nucleus with the <lb/>same atomic number Z. The ratios are almost constant, <lb/> N (s)/N (p) ≈ 23 in a wide region of atomic numbers. The <lb/>inset displays the same quantities in the linear scale except for <lb/>the <lb/> 138  Ce and <lb/> 180  W pairs which show large deviations from the <lb/>scaling value ≈ 23. Deviations from the scaling and the uncer-<lb/>tainty of the Os and Pt isotopes are discussed in the text. <lb/> ous theoretical calculations that the p-nuclei are produced <lb/>by the p-process (or γ-process) in SN explosions [15,16, <lb/>17]: namely, the pre-existing nuclei in massive stars are <lb/>affected by the s-process during the pre-supernova evolu-<lb/>tionary stage and the p-nuclei are subsequently produced <lb/>from them by photodisintegration reactions such as (γ, n) <lb/>reactions in a huge photon bath at extremely high tem-<lb/>peratures in SN explosions. The previous calculations indi-<lb/>cated that the p-nuclei are produced via two paths, direct <lb/>(γ, n) reactions and the EC/β <lb/> +  -decay from the neutron-<lb/>deficient unstable nuclei which are first transmuted by suc-<lb/>cessive photodisintegration reactions (γ, n), (γ, p), (γ, α) <lb/> from heavier elements. The first scaling suggests that the <lb/>former reactions are likely to play a more important role <lb/>than the latter reactions. The charged particle reactions <lb/>in the rp-process [5,6] and proton-induced reactions by <lb/>cosmic rays [7] change the proton number of seed nuclei. <lb/>In the ν-process, the charged current interaction that has <lb/>a contribution larger than the neutral current interaction <lb/>also changes the proton number [18,19]. Therefore, the <lb/>scaling does not emerge from the dominant charged parti-<lb/>cle processes or the ν-process. The first scaling is, thus, a <lb/>piece of evidence that the p-process is the most promising <lb/>origin of the p-nuclei. <lb/>We finally discuss the reason for the deviations. The <lb/>two large deviations for Ce and W can be explained by an <lb/>exceptional contribution from the r-process because they <lb/>are not shielded against β-decay. The heavy isotopes <lb/> 140  Ce <lb/>and <lb/> 182  W are dominantly synthesized by the r-process. <lb/>This fact indicates that the p-nuclei are not synthesized <lb/>from the seed nuclei of the r-process mass distribution. In <lb/>addition the effect of the neutron magic number N = 82 <lb/>should contribute to the deviation for Ce. The small de-<lb/>viations for Cd, Sn and Gd may originate from a weak <lb/></body>

Their origin may be different with the other <lb/>even-even p-nuclei. The deviations in the heavy-mass re-<lb/>gion may originate from the large uncertainties of the so-<lb/>lar abundances. The uncertainties for <lb/> 184  Os and <lb/> 190  Pt are <lb/>about 50% and 100%, respectively [20]. The measurement <lb/>of their abundances with a high precision is desired. <lb/> 3 Discovery of the second scaling <lb/> We find another scaling law between two p-nuclei with the <lb/>same proton number. Nine elements have two p-nuclei. We <lb/>define that the second p-nucleus is two neutron lighter <lb/>than the first p-nucleus. For example, <lb/> 132  Xe is the first <lb/>p-nucleus and <lb/> 130  Xe is the second p-nucleus (see fig. 1). <lb/>Taking the abundance ratio, N (1st p)/N (2nd p), we also <lb/>find a strong correlation between these isotope abundances <lb/>(see fig. 3). The ratios are almost constant in a wide <lb/>range of atomic numbers and they are almost unity, i.e. <lb/> N (1st p)/N (2nd p) ≈ 1. This second scaling is useful <lb/>to constrain the astrophysical condition of the p-process. <lb/>There is a deviation for Er. It can be explained by a con-<lb/>tamination from the β <lb/> −  -decay of <lb/> 163  Dy under stellar s-<lb/>process conditions [21,22]. <lb/> 4 Proposal of a novel concept of the <lb/>universality of the p-process <lb/> The universality of nucleosynthesis processes is an im-<lb/>portant concept for understanding stellar nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis. The Solar System was formed from the ISM origi-<lb/>nated from many nucleosynthesis episodes in stars in the <lb/>Galaxy. The nucleosynthesis environments such as mass, <lb/>metallicity and explosion energy are different and hence <lb/>the produced abundance distribution may be different. <lb/>The abundance distribution in the Solar System material <lb/>is, thus, equal to the average of the stellar nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis processes. However, astronomical observations for very <lb/>metal-deficient stars have reported the &quot; universal &quot; abun-<lb/>dance distribution for Z &gt; 56 [23,24], which is in agree-<lb/>ment with the abundance distribution of the r-process nu-<lb/>clides in the Solar System. These facts suggest a uniform <lb/>site and/or uniform conditions for the synthesis of the r-<lb/>process nuclei. Otsuki et al. could succeed in explaining <lb/>the universality of the r-process by a neutrino-energized <lb/>wind model [25]. <lb/>The N (s)/N (p) ratios for the Solar System abundance <lb/>are subject to galactic chemical evolution. The p-nuclei <lb/>and s-nuclei were produced in different stellar environ-<lb/>ments. Thus, the mass distribution of synthesized nuclei <lb/>may depend on astrophysical conditions. Nevertheless, the <lb/>observed N (s)/N (p) ratios in the Solar System are almost <lb/>constant in a wide region of atomic numbers. The observed <lb/>ratios do not depend on the proton number. This leads to <lb/>a novel concept, &quot; the universality of the p-process &quot; , that <lb/>the N (s)/N (p) ratios produced by individual p-process are <lb/>constant in a wide range. We would like to stress that this <lb/>universality indicates a uniform astrophysical condition or <lb/>a nucleosynthesis process that does not depend on astro-<lb/>physical conditions. The universality is, thus, essential for <lb/>understanding the nucleosynthesis site of p-nuclei. <lb/> 5 Proposal of a novel concept of rate meter <lb/>for the s-process <lb/> The universality of the SN p-process is an important <lb/>concept for understanding the chemical evolution of the <lb/>Galaxy as well as the p-process nucleosynthesis. Figure 4 <lb/>shows a schematic chart for the GCE. First, we would like <lb/>to stress that the s-nuclei in the Solar System were mainly <lb/>produced by the s-process in the low-mass AGB stars [3]. <lb/>In contrast, p-nuclei are synthesized by the p-process in <lb/>SNe. The astrophysical sites for the p-and s-processes are <lb/>different. However, the isotope abundance ratios of the p-<lb/>and s-nuclei have a strong correlation. This fact indicates <lb/>that the average N (s)/N (p) ratios in the first scaling are <lb/>proportional to the abundance synthesized by individual <lb/>s-process and to the frequency of the formation of the <lb/>AGB stars. Second, the s-process nucleosynthesis depends <lb/>highly on the metallicity which increases along the evo-<lb/>lution of the Galaxy [26,27]. These two facts concerning <lb/>s-nuclei and the universality of p-nuclei indicate that the <lb/> N (s)/N (p) ratios should depend on time. <lb/>Astronomical observations of the time variation of <lb/>these ratios for various metallicity stars should constrain <lb/>the galactic chemical evolution of s-nuclei and also pro-<lb/>vide new information on the metallicity dependence of <lb/>the s-process nucleosynthesis [28]. The recent progress in <lb/>spectroscopic studies of extremely metal-poor stars has <lb/>enabled successfully isotope separation of several heavy <lb/>elements [29,30]. It is of particular interest to observe the <lb/>ancient metal-poor stars whose material had been affected <lb/>by a single or a few SN p-processes. Since the primitive <lb/></body>

A schematic chart for the galactic chemical evolution <lb/>for p-and s-nuclei. The s-nuclei in the ISM are dominantly <lb/>produced in the main s-process in the AGB stars. The massive <lb/>stars have contamination of heavy elements from the ISM. The <lb/>heavy elements are irradiated by neutrons in the weak s-process <lb/>before SN explosions and the abundance distribution of the <lb/>heavy elements is changed to that of the s-process. p-nuclei <lb/>are synthesized in the SN p-process. The s-process depends <lb/>strongly on metallicity.

They are 1) O/Ne <lb/>layers in core collapse SNe [8,4], 2) He deflagration in <lb/>C/O white dwarfs [9], 3) accretion disks around neutron <lb/>stars or black holes [11,31]. Since one of the most probable <lb/>site is the O/Ne layer in type-II SNe, we carry out nucle-<lb/>osynthesis calculations of the p-process in SNe [32]. The <lb/>purpose of the calculations is to verify the robustness of <lb/>the scalings in the Solar System abundance and to demon-<lb/>strate the dependence of the calculated ratios, N (s)/N (p) <lb/>and N (1st p)/N (2nd p), on astrophysical conditions. We <lb/>use solar metallicity (Z = Z   ) progenitor models with <lb/>25 solar masses (25M   ) which exploded with an explo-<lb/>sion energy of 10 <lb/> 51  ergs. The s-processed abundances for <lb/>the initial chemical composition are adopted. The calcu-<lb/>lated N (s)/N (p) ratios are shown in fig. 5 by open circles. <lb/>It is shown that they are almost constant in a wide re-<lb/>gion of atomic numbers, although the calculated ratios <lb/>are lower than the observed values. This result is consis-<lb/>tent with the observed scaling.

			<body> We further perform the p-process nucleosynthesis cal-<lb/>culations for the 15 and 40 M   progenitors to study the <lb/>progenitor mass dependence. The abundance patterns of <lb/>the two ratios do not change drastically from those in <lb/>the 25 M   models.

The p-process <lb/>calculations for different models constructed with differ-<lb/>ent explosion energies or the <lb/> 12  C(α, γ) <lb/> 16  O reaction rate <lb/>showed similar abundance distributions [15,16]. These re-<lb/>sults also support the universality of the p-process. Al-<lb/>though these results indicate that p-nuclei in the Solar <lb/>System are mainly produced by the p-process in type-II <lb/>SNe, other astrophysical sites such as deflagrating white <lb/>dwarf stars [9] and supernova-driven supercritical accre-<lb/>tion disks [11,31] may also contribute to p-nuclei. Over-<lb/>production factors of p-process nuclei in realistic models <lb/>of exploding stars were often a factor of a few below what <lb/>is needed to explain the solar abundances. This may sig-<lb/>nal the p-process in some other environments as another <lb/>producer of p-nuclei. We presume that such p-processes <lb/>should also reproduce the two scalings. <lb/> 7 Proposal of a new nuclear <lb/>cosmochronometer <lb/> Long-lived radioactive nuclei are used as nuclear cosmo-<lb/>chronometers, which are useful for an investigation of the <lb/>nucleosynthesis process history along the GCE before the <lb/>Solar System formation. The radioactive nuclei of cosmo-<lb/>logical significance are very rare and only six chronometers <lb/>with half-lives in the range of the cosmic age 1–100 Gyr <lb/>were known. They are <lb/> 40  K [1] and <lb/> 87  Rb [33] for the s-<lb/>process or explosive nucleosynthesis in SNe, <lb/> 176  Lu [34,35] <lb/>for the s-process, and <lb/> 187  Re [33,36,37], <lb/> 232  Th and <lb/> 238  U [1, <lb/>38] for the r-process. Historically, a new cosmochronome-<lb/>ter with suitable half-life has not been proposed for the <lb/>last thirty years. Recently, the two elements U and Th <lb/>were detected for the first time [38] in a very metal-poor <lb/>star. The actinide nuclei in very metal-poor stars were <lb/>perhaps created in a single r-process of a SN explosion. <lb/>The universal scaling also plays a critical role in con-<lb/>structing a chronometer that can be applied to the anal-<lb/>ysis of pre-solar grains in primitive meteorites which had <lb/>been affected strongly by a single or a few nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis episodes. We here propose a new cosmochronometer <lb/> 176  Lu (half-life 37.8 Gyr)-<lb/> 176  Hf-<lb/> 174  Hf of the p-process in <lb/>the SN explosion. Although the <lb/> 146  Sm and <lb/> 92  Nb have al-<lb/>ready been proposed as possible chronometers of the p-<lb/>process [39,40], their half-lives are shorter than the age <lb/> .W <lb/> .W <lb/> *H <lb/> *H <lb/> URTQEGUU <lb/>RRTQEGUU <lb/> +UQOGT <lb/>6  J <lb/>6  Z <lb/> [ <lb/>2JQVQGZEKVCVKQP <lb/>0GWVTQPECRVWTG <lb/> Fig. 7. <lb/> 176  Lu-<lb/> 176  Hf-<lb/> 174  Hf chronometer. The ground state of <lb/> 176  Lu decays to <lb/> 176  Hf with a half-life of 3.78 × 10 <lb/> 10  y. Al-<lb/>though <lb/> 176  Hf is produced by different nucleosynthesis paths, <lb/>the first scaling indicates that the initial abundance of <lb/> 176  Hf <lb/>at the freezeout of the SN p-process can be calculated from the <lb/>present abundance of <lb/> 174  Hf. <lb/> of the Solar System. Therefore, our proposed chronome-<lb/>ter becomes a unique p-process chronometer which has a <lb/>suitable time scale of the order of the cosmic age ∼ 10 Gyr. <lb/>A <lb/> 176  Lu-<lb/> 176  Hf pair was previously proposed as an s-<lb/>process chronometer [34], since <lb/> 176  Lu is a pure s-nucleus. <lb/>The daughter nucleus <lb/> 176  Hf is also a pure s-nucleus and <lb/>is located outside the main path of the s-process. An iso-<lb/>meric state in <lb/> 176  Lu decays to <lb/> 176  Hf with a short half-<lb/>life of 3.64 hours. The experiments using stellar-energy <lb/>neutrons have been carried out and the branching ratio <lb/>between the ground state and the isomer in <lb/> 176  Lu was <lb/>measured. It was, however, pointed out that the solar <lb/>abundances of <lb/> 176  Lu cannot be explained by a classical <lb/>s-process model [35]. The isomer is populated through in-<lb/>termediate states with high excitation energy by (γ, γ <lb/>  ) <lb/>reactions at high temperature, T ∼ 10 <lb/> 8  K (see fig. 7). The <lb/>decay rate of <lb/> 176  Lu depends strongly on the temperature <lb/>and the initial abundance at the end of a nucleosynthesis <lb/>episode cannot be predicted by theoretical calculations. <lb/>The system <lb/> 176  Lu-<lb/> 176  Hf is considered to be useless as a <lb/>chronometer, although it is a good thermometer [35]. <lb/>The p-process chronometer of <lb/> 176  Lu-<lb/> 176  Hf-<lb/> 174  Hf has <lb/>the advantage that the initial abundance of <lb/> 176  Hf can be <lb/>calculated from the present abundance of <lb/> 174  Hf by ap-<lb/>plying the first scaling if the pre-solar grain is affected <lb/>strongly by a single SN event. The first scaling indicates <lb/>that the abundance of <lb/> 174  Hf is proportional to <lb/> 176  Hf, al-<lb/>though <lb/> 176  Hf is produced through different nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis paths. Our proposed chronometer of the p-process is, <lb/>therefore, free from the uncertainty of the initial abun-<lb/>dance. The time passing after the SN p-process can be <lb/>calculated by <lb/> T = − <lb/> T  1/2  ( <lb/> 176  Lu) <lb/>ln 2 <lb/> × ln <lb/> N ( <lb/> 176  Lu) <lb/> N (  176  Lu)+(N (  176  Hf)−R  i  (Hf)×N (  174  Hf)) <lb/> , (1) <lb/></body>

			<body> where, N ( <lb/> A  Z) means the isotope abundance, and R stands <lb/>for the N (s)/N (p) ratio in the scaling in meteorites, which <lb/>should be systematically measured or predicted by p-<lb/>process calculations. Heavy elements such as Sr, Zr, Mo <lb/>and Ba in a primitive material such as the pre-solar grains <lb/>have already been successfully separated into isotopes in-<lb/>cluding p-nuclei, whose origin is considered to be the <lb/>ejecta of core collapse SN explosions [41,42]. Although <lb/>the pre-solar grains would be likely to condense <lb/> 176  Hf and <lb/> 176  Lu from other regions of the star, the chemical compo-<lb/>sition of the grains enhanced by the products of the O/Ne <lb/>layer may be found. The separation of the three isotopes, <lb/> 174,176  Hf and <lb/> 176  Lu, in the pre-solar grains is highly de-<lb/>sirable. <lb/> 8 Conclusion <lb/> In summary, we have presented two universal scaling laws <lb/>concerning p-and s-nuclei in the Solar System abundance. <lb/>They provide four novel concepts: a piece of evidence that <lb/>the SN p-process is the most probable origin of p-nuclei, a <lb/>universality that the abundance ratios N (s)/N (p) of prod-<lb/>ucts by individual SN p-process are almost constant in <lb/>a wide region of atomic numbers, a rate meter that the <lb/> N (s)/N (p) value is proportional to the frequency of the <lb/>AGB s-process events, and a new nuclear cosmochronome-<lb/>ter for the p-process. The scalings are useful for identifying <lb/>the astrophysical sites of p-nuclei and limiting the contri-<lb/>bution from other nuclear processes. We carry out typical <lb/>type-II SN p-process calculations and the results support <lb/>the universality of the p-process. Therefore our proposals <lb/>provide new insights into the chemical evolution of the <lb/>Galaxy as well as the SN p-process. <lb/></body>

The nucleosynthesis of elements beyond iron is dominated by the s and r processes. However, a <lb/>small amount of stable isotopes on the proton-rich side cannot be made by neutron capture and is thought <lb/>to be produced by photodisintegration reactions on existing seed nuclei in the so-called &quot; p process &quot; . So <lb/>far most of the p-process reactions are not yet accessible by experimental techniques and have to be <lb/>inferred from statistical Hauser-Feshbach model calculations. The parametrization of these models has to <lb/>be constrained by measurements on stable proton-rich nuclei. A series of (n, γ) activation measurements <lb/>on p nuclei, related by detailed balance to the respective photodisintegrations, was carried out at the <lb/>Karlsruhe Van de Graaff accelerator using the <lb/> 7  Li(p, n) <lb/> 7  Be source for simulating a Maxwellian neutron <lb/>distribution of kT = 25 keV. We present here preliminary results of our extended measuring program in <lb/>the mass range between A = 74 and A = 132, including first experimental (n, γ) cross-sections of <lb/> 74  Se, <lb/> 84  Sr, <lb/> 120  Te and <lb/> 132  Ba, and an improved value for <lb/> 130  Ba. In all cases we find perfect agreement with the <lb/>recommended MACS predictions from the Bao et al. compilation. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive <lb/>environments – 27.50.+e 59 ≤ A ≤ 89 – 27.60.+j 90 ≤ A ≤ 149 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nu-<lb/>clei beyond the iron group in a combination of processes <lb/>involving neutron captures on long (s process) or short <lb/>(r process) time scales [1,2]. However, 32 stable, proton-<lb/>rich isotopes between <lb/> 74  Se and <lb/> 196  Hg cannot be formed in <lb/>that way. Those p nuclei are 10 to 100 times less abundant <lb/>than the s and r nuclei in the same mass region. They are <lb/>thought to be produced in the so-called γ or p process, <lb/>where proton-rich nuclei are made by sequences of pho-<lb/>todisintegrations and β <lb/> +  decays [3,4,5]. In this scenario, <lb/>pre-existing seed nuclei from the s and r processes are <lb/>destroyed by photodisintegration in a high-temperature <lb/>environment, and proton-rich isotopes are produced by <lb/>(γ, n) reactions. When (γ, p) and (γ, α) reactions become <lb/>comparable or faster than neutron emission within an iso-<lb/>topic chain, the reaction path branches out and feeds nu-<lb/>clei with lower charge number Z. The decrease in temper-<lb/>ature at later stages of the p process leads to a freeze-out <lb/>via neutron captures and mainly β <lb/> +  decays, resulting in <lb/>the typical p-process abundance pattern with maxima at <lb/> 92  Mo (N = 50) and <lb/> 144  Sm (N = 82). <lb/> a  e-mail: iris.dillmann@ik.fzk.de <lb/> The currently most favored astrophysical site for the <lb/> p process is explosive burning in type-II supernovae. The <lb/>explosive shock front heats the outer O/Ne shell of the <lb/>progenitor star to temperatures of 2–3 GK, sufficient for <lb/>providing the required photodisintegrations. Following the <lb/>nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical models, good agree-<lb/>ment with the required p production is found, with the <lb/>exception of the low (A &lt; 100) and intermediate (150 ≤ <lb/> A ≤ 165) mass range, which are underproduced by factors <lb/>of 3–4 [6]. Currently, however, it is not yet clear whether <lb/>the observed underproductions are due to a problem with <lb/>astrophysical models or with the nuclear physics input, <lb/> i.e. reaction rates. Thus, a necessary requirement towards <lb/>a consistent understanding of the p process is the reduc-<lb/>tion of uncertainties in nuclear data. By far most of the <lb/>several hundreds of required photodisintegration rates and <lb/>their inverses need to be inferred from Hauser-Feshbach <lb/>statistical model calculations [7,8]. Experimental data can <lb/>improve the situation in two ways, either by directly re-<lb/>placing predictions with measured cross-sections in the <lb/>relevant energy range, or by testing the reliability of pre-<lb/>dictions at other energies when the relevant energy range <lb/>is not experimentally accessible. <lb/>The role of (n, γ) reactions in the p process was un-<lb/>derestimated for a long time, although it is obvious that <lb/>they have an influence on the final p-process abundances. <lb/></body>

			<body> Neutron captures compete with (γ, n) reactions and thus <lb/>hinder the photodisintegration flux towards light nuclei, <lb/>especially at lower-Z isotopes and even-even isotopes in <lb/>the vicinity of branching-points. Rayet et al. [9] have stud-<lb/>ied the influence of several components in their p-process <lb/> network calculations. Their nuclear flow schemes show <lb/>that branching points occur even at light p nuclei, and <lb/>are shifted deeper into the proton-rich unstable region <lb/>with increasing mass and temperature. In contradiction to <lb/>Woosley and Howard [3], who claimed for their network <lb/>calculations that (n, γ) can be neglected except for the <lb/>lightest nuclei (A ≤ 90), Rayet et al. also examined the <lb/>influence of neutron reactions for temperatures between <lb/> T  9  = 2.2 and 3.2 GK by comparing overabundance factors <lb/>if (n, γ) reactions on Z &gt; 26 nuclides are considered or <lb/>completely suppressed. As a result, the overabundances <lb/>were found to change by up to a factor 100 (for <lb/> 84  Sr) if <lb/>the (n, γ) channel was artificially suppressed. This rather <lb/>high sensitivity indicates the need for reliable (n, γ) rates <lb/>to be used in p-process networks. <lb/>The influence of a variation of reaction rates on the <lb/>final p abundances has also been studied previously [10, <lb/>11]. It turned out that the p abundances are very sensitive <lb/>to changes of the neutron-induced rates in the entire mass <lb/>range, whereas the proton-induced and α-induced reac-<lb/>tion rates are important at low and high mass numbers, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>A third reason for the determination of neutron cap-<lb/>ture rates of p nuclei are those cases where experimen-<lb/>tal photodissociation rates are not accessible. The respec-<lb/>tive astrophysical photodisintegration rate can then be in-<lb/>ferred from capture rates by detailed balance [12]. This <lb/>is the case for most stable p nuclei, which are separated <lb/>from stable isotopes by a radioactive nucleus. While the <lb/>reaction rate <lb/> A  X(γ, n) <lb/> A−1  X can be determined by brems-<lb/>strahlung [13], the reaction <lb/> A+1  X(γ, n) <lb/> A  X has to be mea-<lb/>sured via its inverse (n, γ) rate. <lb/>The present work comprises the first measurement of <lb/>(n, γ) cross-sections for the p-process isotopes <lb/> 74  Se, <lb/> 84  Sr, <lb/> 120  Te and <lb/> 132  Ba at kT = 25 keV, and a re-measurement <lb/>of <lb/> 130  Ba. The direct determination of stellar (n, γ) rates <lb/>requires a &quot; stellar &quot; neutron source yielding neutrons with <lb/>a Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution. We achieve this <lb/>by making use of the <lb/> 7  Li(p, n) <lb/> 7  Be reaction. In combination <lb/>with the activation or time-of-flight technique, this offers <lb/>a unique tool for comprehensive studies of (n, γ) rates and <lb/>cross-sections for astrophysics. <lb/> 2 Experimental procedure <lb/> All measurements were carried out at the Karlsruhe <lb/>3.7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator using the activation <lb/>technique. Neutrons were produced with the <lb/> 7  Li(p, n) <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>source by bombarding 30 μm thick layers of metallic Li <lb/>on a water-cooled Cu backing with protons of 1912 keV, <lb/>30 keV above the reaction threshold. The resulting quasi-<lb/>stellar neutron spectrum approximates a Maxwellian dis-<lb/>tribution for kT = 25.0 ± 0.5 keV [14]. Hence, the proper <lb/>stellar capture cross-section can be directly deduced from <lb/>our measurement. <lb/>For all activations natural samples of the respective <lb/>element were used. The selenium and tellurium samples <lb/>were prepared from metal granules, whereas for the bar-<lb/>ium and strontium measurement thin pellets were pressed <lb/>from powders of Sr(OH)  2  , SrF  2  , SrCO  3  and BaCO  3  . In or-<lb/>der to verify the stoichiometry, the powder samples were <lb/>dried at 300 <lb/> •  C and 800 <lb/> •  C, respectively. All samples were <lb/>enclosed in a 15 μm thick aluminium foil and sandwiched <lb/>between 10–30 μm thick gold foils of the same diameter. <lb/>In this way the neutron flux can be determined relative to <lb/>the well-known capture cross-section of <lb/> 197  Au [14]. <lb/>Throughout the irradiation the neutron flux was recor-<lb/>ded in intervals of 1 min using a <lb/> 6  Li-glass detector for later <lb/>correction of the number of nuclei, which decayed during <lb/>the activation. The activations were carried out with the <lb/>Van de Graaff accelerator operated in DC mode with a <lb/>current of ≈ 100 μA. The mean neutron flux over the pe-<lb/>riod of the activations was ≈ 1.5 × 10 <lb/> 9  n/s at the position <lb/>of the samples, which were placed in close geometry to <lb/>the Li target. The duration of the single activations var-<lb/>ied between 3 h (for the partial cross-section to <lb/> 85  Sr <lb/> m  , <lb/> t  1/2  = 67.6 m) and 130 h (for determination of the 10.52 y <lb/>ground state of <lb/> 133  Ba). <lb/> 3 Data analysis <lb/> The induced γ-ray activities were counted after the ir-<lb/>radiation in a well-defined geometry using a shielded Ge <lb/>detector in a low background area. Energy and efficiency <lb/>calibrations have been carried out with a set of refer-<lb/>ence γ-sources in the energy range between 60 keV and <lb/>2000 keV. For the counting of the long-lived <lb/> 133  Ba <lb/> g  activ-<lb/>ity (t  1/2  = 10.52 y) two fourfold segmented Clover detec-<lb/>tors in close geometry were used [15]. <lb/>A detailed description of the analysis procedure is <lb/>given in refs. [16,17]. The number of activated nuclei A <lb/> can be written as <lb/> A(i) = Φ  tot  N  i  σ  i  f  b  (i), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where Φ  tot  = <lb/> φ(t)dt is the time-integrated neutron flux <lb/>and N  i  the number of atoms in the sample. The factor f  b <lb/> accounts for the decay of activated nuclei during the irra-<lb/>diation time t  a  as well as for variations in the neutron flux. <lb/>As our measurements are carried out relative to <lb/> 197  Au as <lb/> Table 1.

But to obtain the exact <lb/>Maxwellian averaged cross-section σ  kT  = <lb/> συ <lb/> υT  for the <lb/>temperature T , the energy-dependent cross-section σ(E) <lb/> has to be folded with the experimental neutron distribu-<lb/>tion to derive a normalization factor NF = <lb/> σ <lb/>σexp  . The <lb/>normalized cross-section in the energy range 0.01 ≤ E  n  ≤ <lb/> 4000 keV was used for deriving the proper MACS as a <lb/>function of thermal energy kT : <lb/> συ <lb/> v  T <lb/> = σ  kT  = <lb/>2 <lb/> √ <lb/> π <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> σ(En) <lb/>NF  E  n  e <lb/> −En/kT  dE  n <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> E  n  e  −En/kT  dE  n <lb/> .

The factor υ  T  = <lb/> 2kT /m denotes the most proba-<lb/>ble velocity with the reduced mass m. <lb/> Maxwellian averaged cross-sections have to be cor-<lb/>rected by a temperature-dependent stellar enhancement <lb/>factor <lb/> SEF (T ) = <lb/> σ <lb/> star <lb/> σ  lab  . <lb/> (5) <lb/>The stellar cross-section σ <lb/> star  = <lb/> μ <lb/> ν  σ <lb/> μν  accounts for <lb/>all transitions from excited target states μ to final states <lb/> ν in thermally equilibrated nuclei, whereas the laboratory <lb/>cross-section σ <lb/> lab  = <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν  σ <lb/> 0ν  includes only captures <lb/>from the target ground state. In the investigated cases <lb/>the thermal population effects in the stellar plasma at p-<lb/> process temperatures are small for Se and Sr, but increase <lb/>up to 1.42 for Ba (table 1). <lb/> 4.2 Experimental results <lb/> For sample characteristics, activation features, and a de-<lb/>tailed discussion of the Se and Sr results see ref. [17]. The <lb/>results of the Te and Ba measurements in this paper are <lb/>yet preliminary and correspond only to the cross-sections <lb/>derived with the experimental neutron distribution at <lb/> kT = 25 keV. Nevertheless, this value approximates the <lb/>Maxwellian averaged cross-section at kT = 30 keV very <lb/>well and can be used for comparison with other stellar <lb/>cross-sections. The resulting MACS at 30 keV (for Se and <lb/>Sr) and the experimental values for Te and Ba are shown <lb/>in table 2. The extrapolation to higher (p-process) tem-<lb/>peratures will not be discussed here and can also be found <lb/>in ref. [17]. <lb/> 4.2.1 <lb/> 74  Se(n,γ) <lb/> 75  Se <lb/> The <lb/> 74  Se(n, γ) <lb/> 75  Se reaction was analyzed via the two <lb/>strongest transitions in <lb/> 75  As at 136.0 keV and 264.7 keV <lb/>(table 3). The capture cross-section derived with the ex-<lb/>perimental neutron distribution is 281 ± 15 mb. The re-<lb/>sult for the stellar cross-section is σ  30  = 271 mb, in <lb/>perfect agreement with the previously estimated value of <lb/>267 ± 25 mb from ref. [18]. <lb/> 4.2.2 <lb/> 84  Sr(n,γ) <lb/> 85  Sr <lb/> g,m <lb/> In case of <lb/> 84  Sr, neutron captures populate both the ground <lb/>and isomeric state of <lb/> 85  Sr. While <lb/> 85  Sr <lb/> g  decays can be <lb/>identified via the 514 keV transition in <lb/> 85  Rb, the decay of <lb/>the isomer proceeds mainly via transitions of 232 keV and <lb/>151 keV. The isomeric state is 239 keV above the ground <lb/>state and decays either via a 7 keV–232 keV cascade (in-<lb/>ternal transition, 86.6%) or directly by electron capture <lb/>(13.4%) into the 151 keV level of the daughter nucleus. <lb/>The partial cross-section to the isomeric state can be <lb/>easily deduced from the above-mentioned transitions at <lb/>151 keV and 232 keV and yields 189 ± 10 mb. The cross-<lb/>section to the ground state was measured to 112 ± 8 mb, <lb/>which leads to a total capture cross-section of 301±17 mb. <lb/>The result for the total stellar cross-section of <lb/> 84  Sr is <lb/> σ  30  = 300 mb, 17% lower than the 368 ± 125 mb from <lb/>ref. [18]. The partial cross-section to the isomer yields <lb/> σ  30  (part) = 190 mb. <lb/></body>

The partial cross-<lb/>section of the isomeric state cannot be measured directly <lb/>after the irradiation due to a huge Compton background <lb/>around 210 keV, but after a waiting time of 80 d the <lb/>expected 212 keV line from the IT to the ground state <lb/>(88.6%) could be determined. <lb/>The preliminary result for the neutron capture to the <lb/>ground state is 390 ± 16 mb, and 61 ± 2 mb for the partial <lb/>cross-section to the isomeric state. This leads to a (prelim-<lb/>inary) total (n, γ) cross-section of 451±18 mb, which again <lb/>is in good agreement with the estimated 420±103 mb from <lb/>ref. [18]. <lb/> 4.2.4 <lb/> 130  Ba(n,γ) <lb/> 131  Ba <lb/> The <lb/> 130  Ba cross-section can be determined via the transi-<lb/>tions at 124 keV, 216 keV, 373 keV and 496 keV from the <lb/> β <lb/> +  decay into <lb/> 131  Cs. The resulting experimental cross-<lb/>section is 694 ± 20 mb, which exhibits a much smaller un-<lb/>certainty than the 760 ± 110 mb ones from ref. [27], which <lb/>were derived at a filtered neutron beam. <lb/> 4.2.5 <lb/> 132  Ba(n,γ) <lb/> 133  Ba <lb/> g,m <lb/> The partial cross-section to the 38.9 h isomer in <lb/> 133  Ba was <lb/>measured via the 276 keV line (IT) to be 33.6±1.7 mb. The <lb/>total capture cross-section was determined with a Clover <lb/>detector via the strongest EC decay transition into <lb/> 133  Cs <lb/>at 356.0 keV. The preliminary result is 368 ± 25 mb, in <lb/>perfect agreement with the estimated 379 ± 137 mb from <lb/>ref. [18]. <lb/> 4.3 Comparison with theory <lb/> Figure 1 shows a comparison of our experimental total <lb/>capture cross-sections with σ  30  values derived with vari-<lb/>ous theoretical models [28,29,30,31,32,24,23,20]. For <lb/> 74  Se <lb/>and <lb/> 84  Sr the experimental value shown is the MACS de-<lb/>rived with the energy dependence of JEFF 3.0 [17,33], <lb/>whereas the preliminary values for <lb/> 120  Te, <lb/> 130  Ba and <lb/> 132  Ba <lb/>shown here are only cross-sections derived with the exper-<lb/>imental neutron distribution. <lb/>In the case of <lb/> 130  Ba our experimental value agrees with <lb/>the measurement of ref. [27]. In all other cases we find <lb/>good agreement with the semi-theoretical values of Bao <lb/> et al.

A test launch of the KADoNiS webpage started in <lb/>May 2005 with an online version of the original Bao et al. <lb/> paper. By the end of June 2005 the first updated version <lb/>was online. For the six isotopes <lb/> 128–130  Xe, <lb/> 147  Pm, <lb/> 151  Sm <lb/>and <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> m  the previously recommended semi-theoretical <lb/>MACS were replaced by first experimental results. More <lb/>than 40 isotopes (a list is available online) exhibit new <lb/>measurements, which were included to re-evaluate the <lb/>recommended MACS. <lb/>The KADoNiS data sheets include all necessary infor-<lb/>mation for the respective (n, γ) reaction (recommended <lb/>total and partial cross-sections, all available published val-<lb/>ues with references, energy dependence of the MACS for <lb/>5 &lt; kT &lt; 100 keV, and the respective stellar enhancement <lb/>factors). <lb/>The second part of the KADoNiS is planned to be a <lb/>collection of experimental p-process reaction rates, includ-<lb/>ing (n, γ), (p, γ), (α, γ) and their respective photodissoci-<lb/>ation rates.

A research program has been started to study experimentally the near-threshold photodissoci-<lb/>ation of nuclides in the chain of cosmic heavy-element production with bremsstrahlung from the ELBE <lb/>accelerator. An important prerequisite for such studies is the good knowledge of the bremsstrahlung distri-<lb/>bution which was determined by measuring the photodissociation of the deuteron and by comparison with <lb/>model calculations. First data were obtained for the astrophysically important target nucleus <lb/> 92  Mo by ob-<lb/>serving the radioactive decay of the nuclides produced by bremsstrahlung irradiation at end-point energies <lb/>between 11.8 MeV and 14.0 MeV. The results are compared to recent statistical model calculations. <lb/> PACS. 25.20.-x Photonuclear reactions – 25.20.Dc Photon absorption and scattering – 26.30.+k Nucle-<lb/>osynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive environments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The 35 neutron-deficient stable isotopes between Se and <lb/>Hg that are shielded from the rapid neutron capture pro-<lb/>cess by stable isobars, and that are bypassed by slow neu-<lb/>tron captures of the s-process, are called p-process nuclei. <lb/>They are thought to be produced during supernova ex-<lb/>plosions through chains of photodissociation reactions on <lb/>heavy seed nuclei like (γ, n), (γ, p) and (γ, α). In proton-<lb/>rich scenarios also (p, γ) reactions can occur. The tempera-<lb/>tures are in the region of T = (1–3)·10 <lb/> 9  K. These tempera-<lb/>tures need to occur on a short time scale to avoid the nuclei <lb/>to be eroded by photodissociation reactions into light nu-<lb/>clei in the iron region. For a current review of the p-process <lb/>see ref. [1]. In many network calculations of the p-process <lb/>nucleosynthesis, Mo and Ru isotopes are produced with <lb/>abundances lower than determined experimentally. <lb/> 92  Mo <lb/>is the second most abundant p-nucleus with a solar-system <lb/>abundance of 0.378 relative to 10 <lb/> 6  Si atoms. Therefore, it <lb/>is adequate to test if the photodissociation rates in the re-<lb/>gion of <lb/> 92  Mo that are part of the nuclear physics input to <lb/>the network calculations, are correct. We have set up an <lb/>activation experiment with bremsstrahlung from the new <lb/>ELBE accelerator at the Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, <lb/>Dresden, to investigate the photodissociation of <lb/> 92  Mo. <lb/> a  e-mail: a.junghans@fz-rossendorf.de <lb/> 2 Experimental setup <lb/> At the Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, Dresden, a new <lb/>superconducting electron accelerator named ELBE (for <lb/>Electron Linear accelerator of high Brilliance and low <lb/>Emittance) has been built, which combines a high average <lb/>beam current with a high duty cycle. The accelerator de-<lb/>livers electron beams of energies up to 40 MeV with aver-<lb/>age currents up to 1 mA for experiments studying photon-<lb/>induced reactions. The micro-pulse repetition rate of the <lb/>accelerator can be set between 1.6 MHz and 260 MHz. In <lb/>addition, a macro-pulse of 0.1 ms to 35 ms with periods <lb/>of 40 ms to 1 s, respectively, can be applied. The brems-<lb/>strahlung facility and the experimental area were designed <lb/>such that the production of neutrons and the scattering of <lb/>photons from surrounding materials are minimized [2]. A <lb/>floorplan of the bremsstrahlung facility at ELBE is shown <lb/>in fig. 1. The primary electron beam is focussed onto a <lb/>thin foil made from niobium with various areal densities <lb/>between 1.7 mg/cm <lb/> 2  and 10 mg/cm <lb/> 2  corresponding to 1.6· <lb/>10 <lb/> −4  and 1 · 10 <lb/> −3  radiation lengths, respectively. After the <lb/>radiator, the electron beam is separated from the photons <lb/>by a dipole magnet and dumped into a graphite cylinder of <lb/>600 mm length and 200 mm diameter. A photo-activation <lb/>site is located behind the beam dump using available pho-<lb/>ton fluxes of up to 10 <lb/> 10  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  MeV <lb/> −1  . For in-beam <lb/>studies with bremsstrahlung, a photon beam is formed by <lb/>a collimator made from high-purity aluminum placed in-<lb/>side the concrete shielding of the accelerator hall.

			<body> Fig. 1. Bremsstrahlung facility and experimental area for photon-scattering and photodissociation experiments at the ELBE <lb/>accelerator. <lb/> 197  Au and H3 <lb/> 11  BO3 samples were irradiated at the target position in the bremsstrahlung cave. <lb/> nat  Mo and <lb/> 197  Au <lb/>samples were irradiated together at the photo-activation site. <lb/> scattered from a target are observed by means of high-<lb/>purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The photon flux at <lb/>the target position amounts up to 10 <lb/> 8  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  MeV <lb/> −1 <lb/> in the bremsstrahlung cave. All HPGe detectors are <lb/>surrounded by escape-suppression shields consisting of <lb/>bismuth-germanate (BGO) scintillation detectors. In or-<lb/>der to determine the intensity, the spectral distribution <lb/>and the degree of polarisation of the bremsstrahlung, the <lb/>photodissociation of the deuteron <lb/> 2  H(γ, p)n can be used. <lb/>The count rate, the energy distribution and the azimuthal <lb/>asymmetry of emitted protons is detected by four identi-<lb/>cal silicon semiconductor detectors placed symmetrically <lb/>around the beam line at 90 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam. <lb/> 3 Photo-activation measurements <lb/> The number of radioactive nuclei N  act  (E  0  ) produced in <lb/>a photo-activation measurement is proportional to the <lb/>integral of the absolute photon flux Φ  γ  (E, E  0  ) and the <lb/>photodissociation cross-section σ  γ,x  (E) from the reaction <lb/>threshold energy E  thr  up to the bremsstrahlung spectrum <lb/>end-point energy E  0  . The symbol x = n, p, α stands for the <lb/>emitted particle. N  tar  is the number of the target atoms <lb/>in the sample: <lb/> N  act  (E  0  ) = N  tar  · <lb/>  E0 <lb/>E  thr <lb/> σ  γ,x  (E) · Φ  γ  (E, E  0  ) dE . (1) <lb/>The number of radioactive nuclei N  act  (E  0  ) is determined <lb/>experimentally after irradiation with bremsstrahlung in <lb/>a low-level gamma-counting setup using a 100% HPGe <lb/>detector: <lb/> N  act  (E  0  ) = Y (E  γ  ) · κ  corr  / <lb/> ε(E  γ  ) · p(E  γ  ) <lb/> . <lb/> (2) <lb/> Y (E  γ  ), ε(E  γ  ), p(E  γ  ) are the dead-time and pile-up cor-<lb/>rected full-energy peak counts of the observed transition, <lb/>the absolute efficiency of the detector at the energy E  γ <lb/> and the emission probability of the photon with energy <lb/> E  γ  , respectively. The factor κ  corr  contains the relation of <lb/>the detected decays in the measurement time t  meas  to the <lb/>number of radioactive nuclei present. Decay losses in the <lb/>time t  loss  in-between the bremsstrahlung irradiation and <lb/>the beginning of the measurement as well as the decay <lb/>during the irradiation time t  irr  are taken into account. <lb/>The symbol τ denotes the mean lifetime of the radioac-<lb/>tive nucleus produced during the photo-activation: <lb/> κ  corr  = <lb/>exp(t  loss  /τ ) <lb/>1 − exp(−t  meas  /τ ) <lb/> · <lb/> t  irr  /τ <lb/> 1 − exp(−t  irr  /τ ) <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>The constancy of the electron beam current and thus of <lb/>the photo-activation rate was checked by monitoring the <lb/>electron current both in the injector and in the beam <lb/>dump. During a typical irradiation time of 8–16 hours <lb/>there were no electron beam outages. <lb/>The setup can be used for photo-activation measure-<lb/>ments in the following way: The sample (Mo) is activated <lb/>in the high photon flux behind the beam dump together <lb/>with a Au sample to measure an activation standard re-<lb/>action, e.g. <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) (photo-activation site in fig. 1). <lb/>During the same experiment another Au sample is irra-<lb/>diated at the target position inside the bremsstrahlung <lb/>cave. There, the absolute photon flux can be determined <lb/>from the (γ, γ <lb/>  ) yield of a sample containing <lb/> 11  B which <lb/>is irradiated in the same place. In <lb/> 11  B the ground-state <lb/>transition width of 4 levels is known with sufficient ac-<lb/>curacy [3]. This measurement is done during the entire <lb/>activation period with HPGe detectors. The cross-section <lb/>of <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) is then renormalized to give the measured <lb/>activation yield with the absolute photon flux determined <lb/>experimentally. With the renormalized <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) cross-<lb/>section and a simulated thick-target bremsstrahlung spec-<lb/>trum, the absolute photon flux at the photo-activation <lb/>site behind the beam dump can be determined.

Figure 2 shows theoretical brems-<lb/>strahlung cross-sections compared to the evaluation of <lb/>Seltzer and Berger [4] for a niobium radiator. The cal-<lb/>culations were made using formulae given by Schiff [5], <lb/>Heitler [6], and Roche [7]; the last one being corrected and <lb/>programmed by Haug [8], who also included an updated <lb/>screening correction due to Salvat et al. [9]. Al-Beteri et <lb/>al. performed a theory-motivated parametrization of ex-<lb/>perimental data as known in 1988 [10]. <lb/>All curves shown give results that agree to within <lb/>5 percent of each other at the low-energy side of the <lb/>spectrum, when atomic screening is taken into account. <lb/>At the high-energy side at about  1 MeV below the <lb/>end point the descriptions differ to typically 20 percent. <lb/>This will influence the activation yield around the reac-<lb/>tion threshold, where the yield integral depends strongly <lb/>on the overlap with the high-energy tail of the photon <lb/>spectrum. For <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n), e.g., (cross-section calculated <lb/>with ref. [11]) the yield integral calculated with the Al-<lb/>Beteri cross-section [10] is about 25 percent higher at <lb/>100 keV above E  thr  , compared to using the formula given <lb/>by Schiff [5]. At E  thr  +1.5 MeV the uncertainty due to the <lb/>different photon spectra is below 5 percent. <lb/>The electron beam energy and the electron beam en-<lb/>ergy width determine the high-energy part of the brems-<lb/>strahlung spectrum. They need to be known with high <lb/>precision. An uncertainty of the electron beam energy of <lb/> ±100 keV at energies around 10 MeV has significant in-<lb/>fluence on the yield integral. For <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) this error <lb/>would change the yield integral by 20(10) percent at end-<lb/>point energy E  0  = E  thr  +1.0(2.0) MeV. The data shown in <lb/>this work were measured at E  0  &gt; 11.8 MeV which is sev-<lb/>eral MeV above the respective <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) and <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, p) <lb/>reaction thresholds. The electron beam energy was de-<lb/>termined through the ion optical setting of the accelera-<lb/>tor and the beam line and also online by measuring the <lb/>deuteron breakup. <lb/>To a lesser extent the absolute photon flux in the ex-<lb/>periment also depends on the electron beam energy width, <lb/>which needs to be taken into account in the photon flux <lb/>determination for reaction yields measured close to the re-<lb/>action threshold. At ELBE, the energy width of the beam <lb/>has been measured ion optically to be 60 keV (FWHM) <lb/>during the measurements discussed here. <lb/>We have determined experimentally the end-point en-<lb/>ergy and also the spectral distribution of the bremsstrahl-<lb/>ung by measuring proton spectra from deuteron breakup, <lb/>shown in fig. 3. For details, see ref. [2].

Figure 3 shows that the <lb/>spectrum can be well described with the Roche or Al-<lb/>Beteri cross-sections, whereas the Bethe-Heitler formula is <lb/>lower, as Coulomb correction terms are not included there. <lb/>We have also compared different Monte-Carlo Simula-<lb/>tions to the tables of Seltzer and Berger, by making sim-<lb/>ple simulations of the absolute photon spectrum created <lb/>in a thin Nb radiator. Figure 4 shows that both versions of <lb/>GEANT [12] show appreciable differences from the Seltzer <lb/>and Berger evaluation, while the MCNP4C2 (Monte Carlo <lb/>N-Particle Transport Code) [12] simulation corresponds <lb/>very closely to the data. MCNP uses the Seltzer and <lb/>Berger evaluation [4]. For GEANT3 the CERN Program <lb/>library long write-up states that Seltzer and Berger is used <lb/>as well. GEANT4 takes bremsstrahlung cross-section in-<lb/>put from the Evaluated Electron Data Library [13]. The <lb/>simulations from GEANT4 and MCNP agree only at en-<lb/>ergies above 7 MeV when using 10 MeV electrons. From <lb/>our study of the deuteron breakup we strongly favour the <lb/>Roche code [7,8,9] and the concurrent tables of Seltzer <lb/>and Berger [4], respectively the MCNP4C2 code. <lb/>With MCNP4C2 we have calculated the absolute pho-<lb/>ton flux at the photo-activation site behind the beam <lb/>dump, see fig. 5. From the comparison with a thin tar-<lb/>get Schiff spectrum one can see how the shape of a thick <lb/>target spectrum is changed due to creation of photon-<lb/>electron cascades and multiple scattering. The thick target <lb/>spectral shape is required to determine the absolute pho-<lb/>ton flux for the Mo samples that were irradiated at the <lb/>photo-activation site with the bremsstrahlung produced <lb/>in a thick graphite block. Based on a parametrization of <lb/>the MCNP results the thick-target photon flux, that was <lb/>used in the analysis of our Mo photo-activation data, was <lb/>calculated. <lb/> Fig. 5.

The <lb/>dashed line denotes a theoretical thin-target bremsstrahlung <lb/>spectrum calculated according to Schiff [5]. It is normalized to <lb/>the MCNP simulation at 6 MeV. The full line is a parametriza-<lb/>tion of the MCNP simulation. <lb/> 3.2 <lb/> 197 Au(γ, n) as activation standard <lb/> 197  Au samples of approximately 200 mg have been irradi-<lb/>ated at the target position together with an H  3 <lb/>11  BO  3  sam-<lb/>ple enriched in <lb/> 11  B to 99.27 percent and mass 2.93 g. Ac-<lb/>tivation measurements were performed at end-point ener-<lb/>gies of 11.8 MeV up to 14.0 MeV. The absolute photon flux <lb/>was determined using known transition strengths in <lb/> 11  B at <lb/> E  γ  (Θ  lab  = 90 <lb/> •  ) = 4444, 5019, 7283 and 8916 keV, respec-<lb/>tively. Detectors were positioned at Θ  lab  = 90 <lb/> •  and Θ  lab  = <lb/>127 <lb/> •  . Angular-correlation effects are important for the <lb/> 11  B <lb/>photon scattering yields as observed especially at 90 <lb/> •  . <lb/>Feeding corrections are estimated to be small for the high-<lb/>energetic transitions (no feeding for the highest transition) <lb/>used here, but will be included in the final data analysis. <lb/>The number of <lb/> 196  Au nuclei produced during the ac-<lb/>tivation was determined from decay measurements in a <lb/>low-level counting setup with a 100% HPGe detector. The <lb/>total efficiency was measured with the help of several cal-<lb/>ibration sources from Amersham and PTB [14] to 3 per-<lb/>cent uncertainty in the energy range 150–2000 keV. A Cd <lb/>absorber was used to minimize coincidence summing ef-<lb/>fects with X-rays emitted from the Au samples and some <lb/>of the calibration sources. The efficiency was checked by <lb/>GEANT3 simulations that were adjusted to the experi-<lb/>mental data to give the efficiency as a function of photon <lb/>energy. Coincidence summing corrections for the 333 keV <lb/>and 356 keV decay lines of <lb/> 196  Au were taken into account. <lb/>The weaker transition at 426 keV into Hg that does not <lb/>have coincidence summing was included in the analysis. <lb/>The number of nuclei produced during the activation at <lb/>the target position was normalized to the number of <lb/> 197  Au <lb/>target nuclei and to the photon flux at E  γ  = 8916 keV. <lb/>The data for <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) are shown in fig. 6 in compar-<lb/>ison with results that were calculated using the absolute <lb/>photon flux determined experimentally and the theoretical <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) cross-section from the TALYS program [11] <lb/></body>

Up to <lb/> E  γ  = 13 MeV the predictions from the NON-SMOKER <lb/>code are systematically lower. TALYS closely matches <lb/>the experimental data around the peak region of the <lb/>GDR. The tails of the GDR are not described well by <lb/>either model, therefore it is not straightforward to use <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) as an activation standard close to the reac-<lb/>tion threshold around 8 MeV, as was also realized previ-<lb/>ously [17]. <lb/> 3.3 Photo-activation measurements of Mo isotopes <lb/> Natural samples of molybdenum (mass 2–4 g, disc diam-<lb/>eter 20 mm) have been irradiated together with the Au <lb/>samples as discussed above. We also did measurements <lb/>with enriched Mo samples to study the dipole strength <lb/> Fig. 7.

			<body> yield integrals calculated with the simulated thick-target <lb/>bremsstrahlung spectrum shown in fig. 5 and the NON-<lb/>SMOKER photodissociation cross-sections. The yield in-<lb/>tegrals are calculated relative to the <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) yield in-<lb/>tegral. The <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, α) data point is taken relative to the <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, p) yield integral measured with the same target. <lb/>The data agree on a scale relative to <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) to <lb/>typically 20–30 percent with the simulation. One can see <lb/>from these measurements, that the (γ, p) reaction cross-<lb/>section for the neutron-deficient isotope <lb/> 92  Mo has about <lb/>the same size as the (γ, n) and extends to lower energies. <lb/>The <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, p) reaction cross-section is dominant at en-<lb/>ergies below 12.6 MeV, as the <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, n) channel is not <lb/>open yet. The <lb/> 91  Nb nuclei produced were identified by <lb/>the 1205 keV transition following the β decay into <lb/> 91  Zr. <lb/>The population of the long-lived (t  1/2  = 680 y) ground <lb/>state in <lb/> 91  Nb that cannot be easily detected in an ac-<lb/>tivation measurement has to be taken into account, e.g. <lb/> by statistical model calculations. With the TALYS code <lb/>we have calculated that this effect is around 5–10 per-<lb/>cent in the energy range measured. The contribution from <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, n) above 12.6 MeV produces shorter-lived activ-<lb/>ity that can be identified with a pneumatic delivery sys-<lb/>tem that is under development. The <lb/> 100  Mo(γ, n) results <lb/>will be used for comparison with Coulomb dissociation <lb/>experiments done at GSI, Darmstadt [19]. The similarity <lb/>of the relative data shown in fig. 8 as compared to the <lb/>NON-SMOKER data [15] suggests already that the pre-<lb/>dicted underproduction of Mo/Ru isotopes might not be <lb/>due to wrong photodissociation rates. Absolute data cur-<lb/>rently under analysis will allow to draw a firm conclusion. <lb/> 4 Conclusion <lb/> First photodissociation measurements of the p-process <lb/>nucleus <lb/> 92  Mo have been performed at the new brems-<lb/>strahlung experiment at FZ Rossendorf, Dresden. The <lb/>activation technique has been used to identify the different <lb/>reaction products. The photodissociation reactions (γ, n), <lb/>(γ, p), and (γ, α) have been observed. The bremsstrahlung <lb/>spectrum has been studied using the photodissociation <lb/>of the deuteron. This allowed to measure the end-point <lb/>energy of the electron beam and to compare different <lb/>formulae for thin-target bremsstrahlung. The absolute <lb/>photon flux has been measured online by known transi-<lb/>tions in <lb/> 11  B and by using the reaction <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) as an <lb/>activation standard. Preliminary results indicate that the <lb/>absolute cross-section of <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) as calculated by the <lb/>NON-SMOKER code is lower than the experimental data. <lb/>This was also found in the energy region below 10 MeV <lb/>in ref. [17]. The reaction yields for <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, p) + (γ, n) <lb/>relative to <lb/> 197  Au(γ, n) agree to within 20–30 percent with <lb/>the model calculations [15]. These reactions contribute to <lb/>the possible destruction of the p-process nucleus <lb/> 92  Mo. <lb/> We thank P. Michel and the ELBE crew for providing stable, <lb/>high-intensity electron beams for the activation measurements <lb/>and A. Hartmann and W. Schulze for continuous valuable tech-<lb/>nical support.

The proton capture cross-sections of the two most proton-rich, stable isotopes of cadmium <lb/>have been measured for the first time in the energy range relevant to the astrophysical p-process.

The cross-sections have been derived by measuring <lb/>the γ-radiation following the β-decay of the <lb/> 107  In and <lb/> 109  In reaction products. The measurements were <lb/>carried out in the energy range between 2.4 and 4.8 MeV which is the relevant energy region (Gamow <lb/>window) for the astrophysical p-process. Preliminary results are presented here and are compared with the <lb/>predictions of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations using the NON-SMOKER code. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive <lb/>environments – 26.50.+x Nuclear physics aspects of novae, supernovae, and other explosive environments <lb/>– 27.60.+j 90 ≤ A ≤ 149 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Despite the tremendous experimental and theoretical ef-<lb/>forts of recent years, the synthesis of the so called p-nuclei <lb/>(the heavy, proton-rich isotopes which cannot be synthe-<lb/>sized by neutron capture reactions in the s-or r-process) <lb/>is still one of the least known processes of nucleosynthesis. <lb/>It is generally accepted that the synthesis of the p-nuclei, <lb/>the astrophysical p-process, involves mainly γ-induced re-<lb/>actions on abundant seed nuclei produced at earlier stages <lb/>of nucleosynthesis by the s-(or to a less extent the r-) pro-<lb/>cess [1]. During the p-process flow, material from the bot-<lb/>tom of the valley of stability is driven to the proton-rich <lb/>side by subsequent (γ, n) reactions. As the neutron sepa-<lb/>ration energy increases along this path, charged-particle– <lb/>emitting (γ, α) and (γ, p) reactions start to play a role <lb/>contributing significantly to the final abundance distribu-<lb/>tion of p-nuclei. <lb/>The high-energy γ-photons necessary for the γ-induced <lb/> reactions are available only in explosive nucleosynthetic <lb/>scenarios. The generally accepted models locate the <lb/>p-process in the deep O-Ne-rich layers of massive stars <lb/>either in their pre-supernova or supernova phases where <lb/>temperatures of a few times 10 <lb/> 9  K are reached. <lb/> a  e-mail: gyurky@atomki.hu <lb/> The comprehensive modeling of the p-process requires, <lb/>on the one hand, detailed information about the stellar en-<lb/>vironment (temperature, original seed abundances, burn-<lb/>ing time scale, etc.). On the other hand, nuclear physics <lb/>plays also an important role. In the p-process modeling, <lb/>the reaction rates of the thousands of nuclear reactions <lb/>involved in nuclear reaction networks must be known. <lb/>The reaction rates of the dominant γ-induced reactions <lb/>are generally calculated with Hauser-Feshbach–type sta-<lb/>tistical models. The rates of γ-induced reactions can be <lb/>calculated from the inverse capture reactions using the <lb/>detailed balance theorem if the cross-sections of the cap-<lb/>ture reactions are known experimentally. While there are <lb/>compilations for the (n,γ) cross-sections, very few charged-<lb/>particle–induced reactions above the iron region have been <lb/>investigated experimentally leaving the statistical model <lb/>calculations largely untested. <lb/>Realizing the need for testing experimentally the sta-<lb/>tistical model calculations, several (p, γ) and a few (α, γ) <lb/> reaction cross-sections have been measured in recent years, <lb/>and the results have been compared with model pre-<lb/>dictions (see, e.g., [2] and references therein). In gen-<lb/>eral, the models are able to reproduce the experimen-<lb/>tal results within about a factor of two, however, some <lb/>larger deviations are also found. The existing experimen-<lb/>tal database is still not enough to check the reliability of <lb/></body>

			<body> model calculations globally, therefore further experimen-<lb/>tal data are highly needed. <lb/>Recently, the (α, γ) cross-section of <lb/> 106  Cd has been <lb/>measured in the energy range relevant to the p-process [3]. <lb/>The results are compared with statistical model pre-<lb/>dictions using different input parameters, e.g. different <lb/>optical potentials. The α + nucleus optical potential is one <lb/>of the key input parameters for the model calculations. <lb/>This potential can directly be determined from (α, α) <lb/> elastic-scattering experiments. Such an experiment is <lb/>also in progress on <lb/> 106  Cd, preliminary results are already <lb/>available [4]. To give a complete description of <lb/> 106  Cd, the <lb/>measurement of its proton capture cross-section is also <lb/>necessary. <lb/>In the present work the proton capture cross-sections <lb/>of <lb/> 106  Cd and <lb/> 108  Cd (the other p-isotope of cadmium) have <lb/>been measured. The <lb/> 106,108  Cd(p, γ) <lb/> 107,109  In cross-sections <lb/>have been measured using the activation technique and <lb/>the results are compared with the predictions of the <lb/>statistical model calculations using the NON-SMOKER <lb/>code [5]. <lb/>The relevant energy region (the Gamow window) for <lb/>the investigated reactions is between 2.4 and 4.7 MeV (for <lb/>a temperature of 3 × 10 <lb/> 9  K, typical for the p-process). <lb/>The aim of the present work is to measure the capture <lb/>cross-sections within the Gamow window. Consequently, <lb/>the results can be compared with model predictions right <lb/>at the astrophysically relevant energies. <lb/> 2 Investigated reactions <lb/> Cadmium has 8 stable isotopes with mass numbers 106, <lb/>108, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114 and 116. The two lightest <lb/>isotopes <lb/> 106  Cd and <lb/> 108  Cd are p-isotopes with low natural <lb/>abundances of 1.25% and 0.89%, respectively. The proton <lb/>capture of these two isotopes leads to unstable In isotopes <lb/>( <lb/> 107  In and <lb/> 109  In) decaying by β <lb/> +  -decay or electron cap-<lb/>ture to <lb/> 107  Cd and <lb/> 109  Cd, respectively. For both isotopes <lb/>the β-decay is followed by γ-radiation which makes it pos-<lb/>sible to determine the proton capture cross-section using <lb/>the activation method. In this method Cd targets are ir-<lb/>radiated by a proton beam and the capture cross-section <lb/>is derived from the off-line measurement of the decay of <lb/>reaction products. <lb/>Table 1 shows the decay parameters of the two In iso-<lb/>topes. Note, that only the strongest γ-radiations following <lb/>the β-decay of the reaction products are listed. <lb/>Owing to the different decay patterns of the two reac-<lb/>tion products, it is possible to measure both cross-sections <lb/>in a single activation experiment if the target contains <lb/>both <lb/> 106  Cd and <lb/> 108  Cd isotopes. Cd targets of natural iso-<lb/>topic abundance could in principle be appropriate for the <lb/>cross-section determination. Proton-induced reactions on <lb/>the heavier Cd isotopes, however, can be disturbing if they <lb/>also lead to off-line γ-radiation. In the astrophysically rel-<lb/>evant low-energy region the cross-sections of the two in-<lb/>vestigated capture reactions are very low, thus the elim-<lb/>ination of any disturbing γ-radiation from the spectra is <lb/>highly needed. Such disturbing γ-radiation can come, e.g., <lb/> Table 1. Decay parameters of <lb/> 107  In and <lb/> 109  In isotopes. Only <lb/>the strongest γ-radiations following the β-decay of the reaction <lb/>products which were used for the analysis are shown. The data <lb/>for <lb/> 107  In are taken from [6] and for <lb/> 109  In from [7] with the <lb/>exception of the <lb/> 109  In half-life which is taken from a more <lb/>recent work [8]. <lb/>Product <lb/>nucleus <lb/>Half life <lb/>Gamma <lb/>energy <lb/>(keV) <lb/>Relative <lb/>intensity <lb/>per decay <lb/>(%) <lb/> 107  In <lb/>32.4 ± 0.3 min <lb/>204.96 <lb/>47.2 ± 0.3 <lb/> 109  In <lb/>4.168 ± 0.018 h <lb/>203.5 <lb/>73.5 ± 0.5 <lb/> 1 <lb/> 10 <lb/>100 <lb/>1000 <lb/>10000 <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/> E  J <lb/> J J <lb/>J  [keV] <lb/>counts/channel <lb/> 0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>198 <lb/>200 <lb/>202 <lb/>204 <lb/>206 <lb/>208 <lb/>210 <lb/>204.97 keV <lb/> 106 <lb/> Cd(p,J) 107 In <lb/>203.5 keV <lb/> 108 <lb/> Cd(p,J) 107 In <lb/> Fig. 1. Typical activation γ-spectrum taken after the irradia-<lb/>tion of a natural Cd target with a 3.8 MeV proton beam. This <lb/>spectrum was taken for 3 hours starting 8 minutes after the end <lb/>of the irradiation. The inset shows the two resolved γ-peaks <lb/> from the two reactions studied. The higher energy peaks visi-<lb/>ble in the spectrum are coming from beam-induced activities <lb/>on heavier Cd isotopes. <lb/> from <lb/> 110  Cd(p, γ) <lb/> 111  In or <lb/> 113  Cd(p, n) <lb/> 113  In. Therefore, in <lb/>order to avoid the disturbing activity produced on heav-<lb/>ier Cd isotopes, enriched targets were used in the lower-<lb/>energy region where the cross-section, and consequently <lb/>the yield of the studied reactions, is very low. <lb/> 3 Experimental procedure <lb/> 3.1 Target preparation <lb/> The targets were prepared by evaporating natural or <lb/>highly enriched Cd onto thin (d = 3 μm) Al foil. The en-<lb/>riched Cd consisted of 96.47% <lb/> 106  Cd and 2.05% <lb/> 108  Cd. <lb/>Note, that this target material is enriched primarily in <lb/> 106  Cd; however, it also contains more <lb/> 108  Cd than natu-<lb/>ral Cd (0.89%), and the ratio of heavier Cd isotopes is <lb/>reduced from 97.86% to 1.48%. The Cd powder was evap-<lb/>orated from a Mo crucible heated by electron bombard-<lb/>ment. The Al foil was placed 5 cm above the crucible in a <lb/>holder defining a circular spot with a diameter of 12 mm <lb/>on the foil for Cd deposition. This procedure made it pos-<lb/>sible to determine the target thickness by weighting. The <lb/>weight of the Al foil was measured before and after evap-<lb/>oration with a precision better than 5 μg and from the <lb/> Gy.

Measurements carried out using natural and enriched Cd targets are represented by <lb/>different symbols. The solid line is the statistical model prediction from the NON-SMOKER code [5]. <lb/> difference the <lb/> 106  Cd number density could be determined. <lb/>Several natural and enriched targets were prepared with <lb/>thicknesses varying between 100 and 600 μg/cm <lb/> 2  . <lb/> 3.2 Irradiations <lb/> The energy range from E  p  = 2.4 to 4.8 MeV was covered <lb/>in 200 keV steps. The activations have been performed at <lb/>the Van de Graaff accelerator of ATOMKI (low-energy <lb/>part E  p  = 2.4 to 3.6 MeV) and at the MGC cyclotron <lb/>of ATOMKI (high-energy part E  p  = 3.6 to 4.8 MeV). <lb/>Each irradiation lasted about 10 hours and the beam <lb/>current was restricted to 500 nA in order to avoid target <lb/>deterioration. The current was kept as stable as possible <lb/>but to follow the changes the current integrator counts <lb/>were recorded in multichannel scaling mode in time steps <lb/>of 10 s. This recorded current integrator spectrum was <lb/>then used for the analysis solving the differential equation <lb/>of the population and decay of the reaction products <lb/>numerically. <lb/>A surface barrier detector was built into the chamber <lb/>at Θ = 150 <lb/> •  relative to the beam direction to detect the <lb/>backscattered protons and to monitor the target stability. <lb/>The RBS spectra were taken continuously and the number <lb/>of counts in the Cd peak was checked regularly during the <lb/>irradiation. Having the beam current restricted to 500 nA, <lb/>no target deterioration was found within the 1% precision <lb/>of the RBS measurement. This is also supported by the <lb/>weight measurement of the target foils after irradiation. <lb/>The beam stop was placed 10 cm behind the target <lb/>from where no backscattered particles could reach the sur-<lb/>face barrier detector. The beam stop was directly water <lb/>cooled. <lb/>In order to find any possible systematic difference be-<lb/>tween the results obtained at the two accelerators, the <lb/> E  p  = 3.6 MeV point has been measured with both ac-<lb/>celerators, and perfect agreement was found (see sect. 4). <lb/>Similarly, the energy points of E  p  = 3.2 and 4.8 MeV have <lb/>been measured twice using natural as well as enriched Cd <lb/>targets. The results with enriched and natural targets are <lb/>again in good agreement. <lb/> 3.3 Detection of the induced γ-radiation <lb/> The γ-radiation following the β-decay of the produced In <lb/>isotopes was measured with a HPGe detector of 40% rel-<lb/>ative efficiency. The target was mounted in a holder at a <lb/>distance of 3.5 cm from the end of the detector cap. The <lb/>whole system was shielded by 10 cm thick lead against <lb/>laboratory background. <lb/>The γ-spectra were taken for at least 10 hours and <lb/>stored regularly in order to follow the decay of the different <lb/>reaction products. <lb/>The absolute efficiency of the detector was measured <lb/>with calibrated <lb/> 133  Ba, <lb/> 60  Co and <lb/> 152  Eu sources. Monte <lb/>Carlo simulations have also been carried out to determine <lb/>the detector efficiency. From the error of the efficiency de-<lb/>termination with radioactive sources and from the devia-<lb/>tion between the measured and simulated efficiencies, a fi-<lb/>nal error of 9% has been assigned to the detector efficiency. <lb/>Figure 1 shows an off-line γ-spectrum taken after <lb/>irradiation with 3.8 MeV protons in the first 3 h counting <lb/>interval. The γ lines used for the analysis are indicated <lb/>by arrows. <lb/>The strongest γ-radiations from the decay of the two In <lb/>isotopes are very close to each other in energy (203.5 and <lb/>204.97 keV). However, the energy resolution of the HPGe <lb/>detector at this low energy is about 0.8 keV (FWHM), <lb/>hence the two peaks could be resolved (see the inset of <lb/>fig. 1). Moreover, the different half-lives of the two reac-<lb/>tion products make the separation even easier. In the case <lb/>of enriched targets e.g., the γ-radiation from <lb/> 107  In (the re-<lb/>action product of the highly enriched <lb/> 106  Cd) is dominant <lb/>at the beginning of the counting, but owing to its much <lb/>shorter half-life, it decays out fast making the detection <lb/>of the weaker <lb/> 109  In decay easier. <lb/>Taking into account the detector efficiency and the rel-<lb/>ative intensity of the emitted gamma rays, coincidence <lb/>summing effects were for both reactions well below 1% <lb/>and were neglected. <lb/></body>

The final analysis of the experimental data is <lb/>still in progress, preliminary results are presented here. <lb/>The measured cross-sections cover more than 3 orders <lb/>of magnitude from about 3 to 5000 μb. Figure 2 shows <lb/>the experimental results in terms of the astrophysical <lb/> S-factor. The data points measured using natural or <lb/>enriched targets are plotted with different symbols. The <lb/>good agreement for the points measured both with natu-<lb/>ral and enriched targets at energies E  p  = 3.2 and 4.8 MeV <lb/>is clearly visible. Owing to the different energy calibration <lb/>of the two accelerators (which was done after the measure-<lb/>ment) the 3.6 MeV points which were measured with both <lb/>accelerators do not coincide perfectly in energy. However, <lb/>it is clearly visible that there is no systematic difference <lb/>between the two points. The predictions of the Hauser-<lb/>Feshbach statistical model code NON-SMOKER are also <lb/>plotted for comparison. For both isotopes the model is <lb/>able to reproduce fairly well the experimental result; <lb/>however at low energies the model seems to underpredict <lb/>the experimental results in the case of <lb/> 106  Cd(p, γ) <lb/> 107  In <lb/>and to a smaller extent also in the case of <lb/> 108  Cd(p, γ) <lb/> 109  In. <lb/>This might be the consequence of the slope of the the-<lb/>oretical curve which seems to be higher than what the <lb/>experimental points show. It is also instructive to exam-<lb/>ine the dependence of the model predictions on the choice <lb/>of input parameters such as nuclear level densities and op-<lb/>tical model potentials. This work is still in progress and is <lb/>beyond the scope of the present paper. <lb/> This work was supported by OTKA (T42733, T49245, F43408, <lb/>D48283). Zs.

The <lb/> 112  Sn(α, γ) <lb/> 116  Te reaction cross-section has been measured to test the applicability of statis-<lb/>tical models, especially NON-SMOKER in the energy range of importance for the astrophysical p-process <lb/>nucleosynthesis. The measurements were carried out at the Notre Dame FN Tandem Van de Graaff accel-<lb/>erator by means of the activation method. Enriched self-supporting foils were irradiated with alpha beams <lb/>over the alpha bombarding energy range of 8 MeV to 12 MeV in 0.5 MeV steps. The induced activity was <lb/>measured with a pair of large volume Ge Clover detectors in close geometry to maximize the detection <lb/>efficiency. The preliminary results are compared with recent statistical model predictions using the code <lb/>NON-SMOKER. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive <lb/>environments – 82.20.Pm Rate constants, reaction cross sections, and activation energies <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The elements heavier than iron are mainly synthesized <lb/>by mechanisms referred to as the slow neutron capture <lb/>(s-process) and the rapid neutron capture (r-process). An <lb/>additional mechanism, the p-process, is responsible for the <lb/>production of the observed rare abundances of the proton-<lb/>rich stable nuclides in the mass range A ≥ 74. These <lb/>so-called p-nuclei are shielded by stable nuclei from the <lb/>production via the r-and s-process. <lb/>Early theories exist for the production of the p-nuclei. <lb/>One of the earliest was proposed by B <lb/> 2  FH [1] who sug-<lb/>gested that the p-process was a series of (p, γ) reactions on <lb/>r-and s-process seeds. It was also suggested by Ito that the <lb/>light p-nuclei could be synthesized at a high-temperature <lb/>condition (T  9  ∼ 3) from seeds by (p, γ) reactions while the <lb/>heavy p-nuclei could be produced at a lower temperature <lb/>(T  9  ∼ 2.5) by (γ, n) reactions [2,3]. <lb/>Current theories include synthesis from the destruction <lb/>of pre-existing s-or r-nuclides by different combinations of <lb/>(p, γ) captures, (γ, n), (γ, p) or (γ, α) reactions. Generally, <lb/>p-nuclei are thought to be synthesized from an unstable <lb/>progenitor through a chain of β-decays [4]. <lb/>In the thermonuclear model, the p-process proceeds via <lb/>a series of photodisintegration reactions, (γ, n), (γ, p) and <lb/>(γ, α) on an existing heavy s-and r-seed in the tempera-<lb/> a  e-mail: nozkan@kou.edu.tr <lb/> ture range 2–3 × 10 <lb/> 9  K. The nuclides are driven by subse-<lb/>quent (γ, n) reactions to the neutron-deficient side where <lb/>(γ, n) and (n, γ) reactions are in equilibrium. The reaction <lb/>path is then dominated by the (γ, p) and/or (γ, α) reac-<lb/>tions [5,6]. It is for this reason that radiative alpha capture <lb/>reactions are of particular importance to the p-process. <lb/>Possible astrophysical scenarios for the p-process un-<lb/>der consideration are massive stars in their pre-supernova <lb/>or Type-II supernova phases, as well as their Type-Ib/Ic <lb/>stages, and white dwarfs exploding as Type-Ia supernova <lb/>in binary systems. Detailed p-process scenarios have been <lb/>reviewed by Arnould and Goriely [7]. <lb/>In comparison to the s-and r-, not much study is <lb/>devoted to the p-process even though many discrepan-<lb/>cies exist. In particular, the theoretical predictions of <lb/>p-nuclei are frequently inconsistent with their observed <lb/>abundances [7]. These abundance predictions are based <lb/>on complex network calculations performed on thousands <lb/>of nuclear reactions involving stable as well as unstable <lb/>proton-rich nuclei within a given astrophysical environ-<lb/>ment. However, only very few of the associated reaction <lb/>rates in the region of interest have been measured. The <lb/>relevant reactions that have been investigated in the mass <lb/>region beyond A = 100 include (α, γ) reactions on targets <lb/>of <lb/> 106  Cd [8], <lb/> 112  Sn [9], <lb/> 139  La [10], and <lb/> 144  Sm [11]. Due to <lb/>the lack of experimental data, p-process studies are based <lb/>mostly on Hauser-Feshbach statistical models to predict <lb/>the reaction rates. Therefore, it is crucial to determine <lb/></body>

			<body> the cross-sections experimentally in order to test the re-<lb/>liability of the input parameters such as optical model <lb/>potentials and nuclear level densities. <lb/>The primary aim of this paper is to extend the exper-<lb/>imental database for simulation of the p-process by mea-<lb/>suring the (α, γ) cross-sections on the p-nucleus <lb/> 112  Sn. The <lb/>photon-induced reaction cross-sections <lb/> 116  Te(γ, α) <lb/> 112  Sn <lb/>(Q = 0.928 MeV) can also be calculated by using the de-<lb/>tailed balance theorem. In order to test the applicability <lb/>of statistical models, the deduced cross-section measure-<lb/>ments are compared with one of the statistical models, <lb/>NON-SMOKER [12]. A discussion of experimental proce-<lb/>dure and a presentation of preliminary results follows. <lb/> 2 Experimental technique <lb/> The cross-section of <lb/> 112  Sn(α, γ) <lb/> 116  Te has been measured <lb/>via the activation technique at the FN Tandem Van de <lb/>Graaff accelerator at the University of Notre Dame, USA <lb/>in the energy range 8–12 MeV. These energies are partic-<lb/>ularly interesting since they are relevant to the Gamow <lb/>window for the high-temperature environments. <lb/>The activation method involves bombarding a stable <lb/>isotope with projectiles to produce a radioactive species <lb/>and the measurement of the residual radioactivity of the <lb/>produced isotopes after the irradiation is stopped. This <lb/>method provides a total cross-section for primary γ-ray <lb/> transitions to particle bound states (which lead to the <lb/>formation of the radioactive species in its ground state). <lb/> 2.1 Targets <lb/> Isotopically enriched <lb/> 112  Sn targets in the form of thin self-<lb/>supporting foils of 2.2 mg/cm <lb/> 2  were used for the measure-<lb/>ments. The highly enriched (99.60 %) <lb/> 112  Sn targets were <lb/>prepared at Argonne National Laboratory via mechanical <lb/>rolling. Metal ingots of enriched Sn are placed in a stain-<lb/>less steel pack in a rolling mill and initially rolled very <lb/>slowly to prevent cracks. They are subsequently rotated <lb/>by 90 <lb/> •  each time while slowly tightening the plate gap <lb/>until a uniform thickness is achieved [13]. <lb/> 2.2 Irradiation of the target <lb/> 112  Sn targets were irradiated with an alpha beam in the <lb/>energy range between 8 and 12 MeV in energy steps of <lb/>0.5 MeV. <lb/>A diagram of the experimental setup for the target ir-<lb/>radiation is shown in fig. 1. In order to get an accurate <lb/>measurement of the total number of charged particles hit-<lb/>ting the target during the irradiation runs, the entire tar-<lb/>get chamber was designed as a Faraday cup (which was <lb/>isolated from the rest of the beam line). The beam cur-<lb/>rent was recorded in real time with a current integrator in <lb/>time steps of 32 s, allowing fluctuations in the beam to be <lb/> Target <lb/> Air Cooling <lb/>Alpha Beam <lb/>Collimator <lb/>Faraday Cup <lb/>Si Detector <lb/>-300V <lb/>Current <lb/>Integrator <lb/> Fig. 1. A drawing of the components used in the beam line <lb/>during the irradiation. The target was placed at the end of the <lb/>beam line. <lb/> monitored. Throughout the irradiations with different α-<lb/> beam energies, the typical current recorded was between <lb/>100 and 250 nA. <lb/>Electric suppression was employed to suppress the sec-<lb/>ondary electron emission from the target by a bias voltage <lb/>of −300 V. Due to the relatively low melting point of <lb/> 112  Sn <lb/>and the thick targets, the target holder was air cooled dur-<lb/>ing the irradiation to prevent target degradation. In ad-<lb/>dition, the target stability was also monitored online by <lb/>detecting the backscattered alphas from the target using a <lb/>collimated Si surface barrier detector at 135 degrees. The <lb/>Si detector was calibrated using a mixed alpha source. <lb/>The length of irradiation was chosen based on the half-<lb/>life of the (α, γ) activation product. The typical irradiation <lb/>time was ∼ 8 h (3× half-life) for low-energy measurements <lb/>due to the steeply decreasing cross-sections at low beam <lb/>energies. <lb/> 2.3 Measurement of the residual radioactivity <lb/> After each irradiation, the target was taken to a remote <lb/>low-background counting area. The counting setup was <lb/>constructed in an area isolated from the target room so <lb/>the detectors would not be saturated by the inevitable <lb/>large flux of radiation produced during irradiation. An-<lb/>other advantage of having a separate counting area is that <lb/>we were able to obtain a larger solid angle by utilizing a <lb/>close geometry for the target and the detectors. <lb/>The detection system was composed of two Clover Ge <lb/>detectors (Clover 1 and Clover 2), each detector having <lb/>four HPGe crystals. Figure 2 shows the arrangement of <lb/>detectors and the irradiated sample in the measurement. <lb/>The two Clovers were utilized as a single detection unit, <lb/>which is said to be operated in &quot; direct &quot; mode as described <lb/>by ref. [14]. This implies that the photopeak detection <lb/>efficiency of the system was the sum of each photopeak <lb/>efficiency of one crystal (8 crystals in all). The nearly <lb/>4π detection geometry offers relatively high efficiency en-<lb/>abling the detection of low-energy gamma peaks at low <lb/> N. ¨ <lb/>Ozkan et al.: A study of alpha capture cross-sections of <lb/> 112  Sn <lb/>147 <lb/> Fig. 2.

(b) Target position <lb/>viewed from the front window of the Clover 2. <lb/> irradiation energies. Due to this geometry, corrections for <lb/>angular-distribution effects were negligible. <lb/>In order to measure the induced γ-ray activity, the <lb/>Clover Ge detectors were placed face to face in close geom-<lb/>etry. The distance between the ends of the detectors was <lb/>fixed at 4.9 mm for reproducibility of the counting geom-<lb/>etry. To reduce the room background, the detectors were <lb/>shielded with 5 cm of Pb and an inner Cu lining of 3 mm. <lb/>After each irradiation, the activated target was placed at <lb/>the center of the detectors and positioned at their com-<lb/>mon axis as shown in fig. 2. Depending on the count rate <lb/>of the targets, the decays were observed in a time interval <lb/>from 20 m to 8 h (t  1/2  = 2.49 h). For the dead-time correc-<lb/>tion, the output signal of a fixed-frequency (100 Hz) pulse <lb/>generator was also fed into the electronics. <lb/> 3 Experimental results <lb/> We were able to measure cross-sections from daughter <lb/>and granddaughter decays since both the daughter nu-<lb/>cleus <lb/> 116  Te (t  1/2  = 2.49 h) and the granddaughter nucleus <lb/> 116  Sb (t  1/2  = 15.8 m) are radioactive as seen in fig. 3. The <lb/> γ-ray spectrum for the <lb/> 112  Sn(α, γ) <lb/> 116  Te reaction obtained <lb/>at 12 MeV α-beam irradiation is presented in figs. 4 and 5, <lb/>as an example of the γ-ray activities accumulated dur-<lb/>ing and after termination of the activation measurements. <lb/>The characteristic γ-transitions of 629 keV and 638 keV <lb/>in <lb/> 116  Sb populated through the β <lb/> +  -decay of the reaction <lb/>product <lb/> 116  Te were used to measure the cross-section in <lb/>the alpha-beam energy range 9.5–12.0 MeV, (fig. 4). For <lb/>cross-section measurements at lower alpha-beam energies, <lb/>we used two additional γ-decay transitions, 932 keV and <lb/>1294 keV, in <lb/> 116  Sn populated by the <lb/> 116  Sb secondary β <lb/> +  -<lb/>decay (fig. 5). <lb/>The total error of the measured cross-section values in-<lb/>cludes two components: statistical error based on counting <lb/> Fig. 3.

The knowledge of the cross sections for photodissociation reactions like e.g. (γ, n) of neutron <lb/>deficient nuclei is of crucial interest for network calculations predicting the abundances of the so-called <lb/> p nuclei. However, only single cross sections have been measured up to now, i.e., one has to rely nearly <lb/>fully on theoretical predictions. While the cross sections of stable isotopes are accessible by experiments <lb/>using real photons, the bulk of the involved reactions starts from unstable nuclei. Coulomb dissociation <lb/>(CD) experiments in inverse kinematics might be a key to expand the experimental database for p-process <lb/> network calculations. The approach to test the accuracy of the CD method is explained. <lb/> PACS. 25.20.-x Photonuclear reactions – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae and other explo-<lb/>sive environments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Most of the elements heavier than iron are produced by <lb/>a sequence of neutron capture processes and β decays. <lb/>The s-process takes place during stellar burning phases <lb/>and is characterized by low neutron densities (n  n  ≈ <lb/> 2–4 · 10 <lb/> 8  cm <lb/> −3  ) and temperatures (T ≈ 1–3 · 10 <lb/> 8  K) [1]. <lb/>Thus, the so-called s-process path is close to the valley <lb/>of stability. In contrast, the r-process deals with high <lb/>neutron densities (n  n  &gt; 10 <lb/> 20  cm <lb/> −3  ) and temperatures <lb/>(T ≈ 2–3 · 10 <lb/> 9  K) and is thought to occur in explosive <lb/>scenarios like, e.g., supernovae [2,3]. <lb/>However, several proton-rich isotopes between Se and <lb/>Hg remain that cannot be produced during either of the <lb/>processes. A complete list of these so-called p nuclei can <lb/>be found in [4,5]. These nuclides are also produced during <lb/>explosive events lasting a few seconds at temperatures of <lb/>about 2–3 · 10 <lb/> 9  K. The lighter p nuclei are thought to be <lb/>produced by proton capture reactions during the so-called <lb/> rp-process [6] while the heavier ones are created from s-<lb/> and r-process seed nuclei by photodissociation processes <lb/>like (γ, n), (γ, p), and (γ, α) reactions in a process some-<lb/>times referred to as γ-process [5]. <lb/>During the γ-process the (γ, n) reactions compete with <lb/>the (γ, p) and (γ, α) processes if the p and α separation en-<lb/>ergies of the produced proton-rich isotopes are low enough. <lb/>The special features corresponding to p-process nucle-<lb/>osynthesis in the A ≈ 100 mass region are discussed in <lb/>sect. 2. In sect. 3 the basics of Coulomb Dissociation ex-<lb/>periments and the SIS/FRS/LAND setup at GSI Darm-<lb/>stadt are explained. <lb/> a  e-mail: kerstin@ikp.tu-darmstadt.de <lb/> 2 The A ≈ 100 mass region <lb/> The three most abundant p isotopes ( <lb/> 92  Mo: 14.84%, <lb/> 94  Mo: <lb/>9.25%, and <lb/> 96  Ru: 5.52% natural elemental abundance) are <lb/>found in the mass region A ≈ 100. This region is the <lb/>borderline between the rp- and γ-process, i.e., it is not <lb/>sure how the p nuclei in this region are produced: in one <lb/>of the two processes or in both simultaneously. Network <lb/>calculations including only the γ-process fail to reproduce <lb/>the observed abundances by a factor of 20 [5], thus, leading <lb/>to the assumption that both processes are responsible for <lb/>the production of the Mo and Ru p nuclei. <lb/>However, the difficulties in reproducing the observed <lb/>abundances might also stem from the nuclear physics part: <lb/>most of the reaction rates being involved in the network <lb/>calculations (compare fig. 1) are calculated by Hauser-<lb/>Feshbach statistical model calculations (e.g., [5]) due to <lb/>the lack of experimental data in the astrophysically rele-<lb/>vant energy region. The typical uncertainties of Hauser-<lb/>Feshbach based calculations are about 20–30% (e.g., [8]). <lb/>However, if proton-rich nuclei in the vicinity of closed <lb/>shells are concerned, it is not clear whether the involved <lb/>level densities are high enough to legitimate this statisti-<lb/>cal approach. Thus, an experimental examination of the <lb/>predicted reaction rates is highly desirable. <lb/>Different approaches are available and necessary to im-<lb/>prove the experimental data base for the γ-process.

Overview of the reactions involved in p-process nucleosynthesis in the mass region A ≈ 100. The stable isotopes are <lb/>printed in black boxes with their natural isotopic abundance. The p nuclei <lb/> 92  Mo, <lb/> 94  Mo, <lb/> 96  Ru, and <lb/> 98  Ru are marked with an <lb/>indented margin. β <lb/> −  -unstable isotopes are printed in light grey, the dark grey boxes stand for β <lb/> +  , ,-unstable isotopes both with <lb/>their half-life under lab conditions. The relevance of the indicated (γ, n), (γ, p), and (γ, α) reactions in a p-process network was <lb/>calculated using ref. [7]. <lb/> Some efforts using continuous bremsstrahlung spectra <lb/>have been made at the S-DALINAC at Darmstadt [10,11] <lb/>and the ELBE setup at Rossendorf [12,13] to determine <lb/>the reaction rates without any assumptions on the shape <lb/>of the cross section&apos;s energy dependence. A determination <lb/>of the reaction rates by an absolute cross section mea-<lb/>surement is possible using monoenergetic photon beams <lb/>produced by Laser Compton Backscattering [14]. <lb/>However, both methods are limited to stable target nu-<lb/>clei. Here, Coulomb dissociation (CD) of fast radioactive <lb/>beams in the Coulomb field of a high-Z target nucleus us-<lb/>ing virtual photons is a viable approach to measure the <lb/>(γ, n) cross sections indirectly. Such experiments can be <lb/>performed with the SIS/FRS/LAND facility at GSI [15] <lb/>as described in the following section. <lb/>The experimental knowledge about the (γ, p) and <lb/>(γ, α) reactions in the corresponding Gamow window is <lb/>even worse. In fact, the experimental data is based on <lb/>the observation of the time reversal (p, γ) and (α, γ) cross <lb/>sections, respectively [16,17,18,19,20] for the proton-rich <lb/>nuclei with mass numbers around 100. Due to the dif-<lb/>ficulties concerning the experimental accessibility of the <lb/>(γ, α) reaction rates, a method using elastic α scattering <lb/>has been established [21,22]. <lb/>Likewise in the case of these charged particle reactions, <lb/>CD provides an alternative possibility for experimental <lb/>studies. The validity of the CD approach has been recently <lb/>demonstrated for the case of the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) reaction, where <lb/>very good agreement has been found between direct and <lb/>indirect methods [23,24]. <lb/> 3 Coulomb dissociation experiments <lb/> In Coulomb dissociation (CD) experiments the Coulomb <lb/>field of a high-Z nucleus is used to excite the nuclei one is <lb/>interested in (see fig. 2). Thus, CD experiments are always <lb/>done in inverse kinematics with the high-Z nuclei as tar-<lb/>gets and the nuclei of interest as projectiles. This forced <lb/>procedure yields the advantage that unstable isotopes can <lb/>be observed if they are available as radioactive beams. <lb/>If, e.g., <lb/> A  Z(γ, n) <lb/> A−1  Z is the reaction of interest one <lb/>has to study the reaction <lb/> 208  Pb( <lb/> A  Z, <lb/> A−1  Z + n) <lb/> 208  Pb us-<lb/>ing CD. The energy of the projectiles is choosen as high <lb/>as possible due to several reasons. First of all, the higher <lb/>the energy of the projectile the more the Coulomb field of <lb/>the high-Z nucleus is distorted, thus, leading to a higher <lb/>fraction of E1 excitations. Secondly, the used detection <lb/></body>

Scheme of a Coulomb dissociation experiment in in-<lb/>verse kinematics observing the reaction <lb/> 92  Mo(γ, n) <lb/> 91  Mo. The <lb/>high-Z target composed of <lb/> 208  Pb is shown with its surround-<lb/>ing field of virtual photons (marked with γ). The incoming <lb/> 92  Mo projectile has an impact parameter b. After passing the <lb/>Coulomb field of <lb/> 208  Pb the now excited nucleus <lb/> 92  Mo <lb/>  *  de-<lb/>excites by emitting a neutron and remains as <lb/> 91  Mo. <lb/> systems cover 4π solid angles due to the fact that all reac-<lb/>tion products are predominantly focussed in forward di-<lb/>rections. At last, CD dominates the nuclear background <lb/>under small scattering angles, hence, yielding a possibil-<lb/>ity to distinguish between these two contributions to the <lb/>cross section. <lb/>The experimental method used at GSI Darmstadt, <lb/>is to produce a high-energy stable or radioactive beam <lb/>and to measure the breakup products in secondary tar-<lb/>gets with full kinematics, thus, allowing the reconstruction <lb/>of the excitation energy by utilizing the invariant-mass <lb/>method. All projectile-like decay products are detected, <lb/> i.e., all reaction products that have velocities close to the <lb/>beam velocity. In this sense, the measurement is kinemat-<lb/>ically complete. Additionally, the γ-rays emitted by the <lb/>excited projectile near the target position are measured. <lb/>The beam is delivered by the heavy-ion synchrotron <lb/>SIS with energies up to 1 GeV/nucleon and intensities of <lb/>about 10 <lb/> 10  ions/s depending on the accelerated nuclei. Ra-<lb/>dioactive beams are produced by the in-flight method us-<lb/>ing a Be production target with a thickness of 4 g/cm <lb/> 2  . <lb/>The fragment separator FRS [25] is used to select the <lb/>fragments of interest according to their magnetic rigid-<lb/>ity. Furthermore, scintillation detectors are placed in the <lb/>FRS beam-line to determine the masses of the fragments <lb/>by time-of-flight measurements. <lb/>In front and behind the target the position of the beam <lb/>is determined by Si pin-diodes. The dimension of the beam <lb/>spot and its emittance is defined by a system of active slits <lb/>called ROLU [26]. The Pb target is placed at the begin-<lb/>ning of the CsI detector [27,28] that is used to measure <lb/>the γ-rays being emitted by the excited projectiles. Each <lb/>of the single crystals covers a solid angle that is defined by <lb/>the aim to realize the Doppler correction by suitable am-<lb/>plifications of the single signals. Thus, the energy of the <lb/>emitted photon in the rest frame of the emitting source <lb/>can be measured directly. <lb/>A large gap dipole magnet (ALADIN, see ref. [29]) sep-<lb/>arates the charged reaction products and the emitted neu-<lb/>trons. To determine the trajectories of the charged frag-<lb/>ments, a position-sensitive Si pin-diode before the magnet <lb/>and two large-area fiber detectors [30] behind the magnet <lb/>are used. By defining the deflection angle in the magnetic <lb/>dipole field, the magnetic rigidity of the particle is fixed. <lb/>The velocity of the particles is measured with the time-<lb/>of-flight (ToF) wall in combination with a thin organic <lb/>plastic scintillator placed close to the target. <lb/>The LAND neutron detector [31] provides with its <lb/>2×2 m <lb/> 2  active area a 100% acceptance for the emitted neu-<lb/>trons with kinetic energies up to 5.6 MeV. Using the two <lb/>far-end sides of the one meter thick detector array time-<lb/>of-flight and position information is available (description <lb/>of the setup after [15]). <lb/>In the current experiment S295 the (γ, n) cross sec-<lb/>tions of the isotopes <lb/> 92,93,94,100  Mo have been observed by <lb/>CD. To study the stable isotopes <lb/> 94  Mo and <lb/> 100  Mo the <lb/>corresponding beams were delivered by the synchrotron <lb/>SIS. The beam of <lb/> 93  Mo and <lb/> 92  Mo nuclei was produced by <lb/>a primary <lb/> 94  Mo beam via one and two neutron removal, <lb/>respectively. However, the cross sections of these two iso-<lb/>topes have been measured one after the other due to an <lb/>easier analysis. <lb/>Additionally, a measurement with a C and a Sn tar-<lb/>get instead of <lb/> 208  Pb was performed to subtract the nu-<lb/>clear contributions to the CD cross sections. To get full <lb/>knowledge about the background conditions an empty-<lb/>target run was also carried out. The whole beam-time <lb/>lasted for nine days and was realized by a collaboration of <lb/>Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, Forschungszentrum Karl-<lb/>sruhe, GSI Darmstadt, and TU Darmstadt. The evalu-<lb/>ation of the data has just started, hence, it is not yet <lb/>possible to show preliminary results. <lb/> 4 Summary and outlook <lb/> The (γ, n) cross sections of the isotopes <lb/> 92,93,94,100  Mo have <lb/>been measured using the Coulomb dissociation technique <lb/>at the SIS/FRS/LAND setup at GSI Darmstadt. To es-<lb/>tablish the accuracy of this method, the cross sections of <lb/>the stable isotopes <lb/> 92  Mo and <lb/> 100  Mo are also determined <lb/>using real photons provided by the bremsstrahlung setups <lb/>at ELBE and S-DALINAC, respectively. <lb/>The expected agreement of the results should establish <lb/>the accuracy of the CD method. Once this goal is achieved, <lb/>CD measurements on many critical but unstable nuclei <lb/>for the p-process can be envisaged. A first example is the <lb/>isotope <lb/> 93  Mo, that cannot be prepared as a target and was <lb/>measured during the current experiment. <lb/> We thank the collaborators of experiment S295 from For-<lb/>schungszentrum Rossendorf, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, <lb/>and GSI Darmstadt for fruitful discussions and their support <lb/>during beam-time. This work is supported by the DFG (con-<lb/>tract SFB 634) and BMBF. <lb/></body>

Direct determination of photoneutron cross sections of astrophysical importance has recently <lb/>become possible with use of quasi-monochromatic γ beams produced in laser Compton backscattering <lb/>(LCS) from relativistic electrons at AIST. The astrophysics to be discussed with the photodisintegration <lb/>cross section are both stellar and big bang nucleosyntheses regarding the production of p-process and <lb/>s-process nuclei as well as light elements. Synchrotron radiations from a 10 tesla superconducting wiggler <lb/>(SCW) at SPring-8 serve as an ideal photon source to determine photoreaction rates. This paper covers <lb/>the latest cross section measurements with the LCS photon beams and a feasibility study of determining <lb/>(γ, x) (x = n, p, α) reaction rates with the SCW radiation. <lb/> PACS. 25.20.-x Photonuclear reactions – 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, <lb/>supernovae, and other explosive environments – 41.60.Ap Synchrotron radiation <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Recently real photon-induced reactions have attracted a <lb/>revived interest in the context of nuclear astrophysics [1]. <lb/>Currently efforts are made for determining photoneutron <lb/>cross sections in the low-energy tail of the giant electric-<lb/>dipole resonance, laboratory reaction rates by photoac-<lb/>tivation, and E1 γ strength function below the neutron <lb/>threshold. Measurements of (γ, α) reactions may not be <lb/>impossible though an intense photon source is required. <lb/>At present all experimental efforts have, as a matter of <lb/>course, been limited to stable nuclei; real photon-induced <lb/>reactions on unstable nuclei are far beyond our scope. <lb/>The direct determination of photodisintegration cross <lb/>sections utilizes quasi-monochromatic γ-ray beams from <lb/>laser Compton backscattering (LCS) that have recently <lb/>become available at AIST [2]. Photodisintegration mea-<lb/>surements are characterized by simplification and accu-<lb/>racy by employing the LCS γ beams, a bulk of target <lb/>material, and a 4π-type neutron detector consisting of <lb/>BF  3  / <lb/> 3  He proportional counters embedded in a poly-ethy-<lb/>lene moderator. It is interesting to note that electric gi-<lb/>ant dipole resonance (GDR) was systematically studied in <lb/> a  e-mail: hiro@konan-u.ac.jp <lb/> 1960s through 1980s with quasi-monochromatic photons <lb/>from positron annihilation in flight in nuclear physics [3], <lb/>whereas the GDR study is currently implemented by the <lb/>LCS photons in nuclear astrophysics with emphasis on <lb/>cross sections in the Gamow energy window for pho-<lb/>tonuclear reactions. The Gamow window lies immediately <lb/>above the threshold energy in the neutron channel [4], <lb/>while in the p or α channels it is shifted from particle <lb/>threshold toward high energies for the Coulomb potential <lb/>effect [5]. Some of the early measurements of GDR ex-<lb/>hibit non-vanishing cross sections below neutron thresh-<lb/>old, necessitating accurate measurements for nuclear as-<lb/>trophysics. <lb/>The astrophysics to be discussed with photodisintegra-<lb/>tion cross sections are both stellar and big bang nucleosyn-<lb/>theses: (a) p-process nuclei; (b) s-process nuclei; and (c) <lb/>light nuclei. The group (a) is directly related to photonu-<lb/>clear reactions. In the group (b) for heavy nuclei with high <lb/>level densities, photoneutron reactions are translated to <lb/>neutron capture by the statistical model, whereas they are <lb/>converted to radiative capture by the reciprocity theorem <lb/>in the group (c) for light nuclei with low level densities. <lb/>In the p-process study, (γ, n) cross sections provide <lb/>strong constraints on the E1 γ strength function from <lb/></body>

			<body> which stellar reaction rates are calculated within the <lb/>framework of the Hauser-Feshbach model [6]. Both photo-<lb/>production and photodestruction cross sections are needed <lb/>to discuss the p-process origin; photodestruction is by far <lb/>difficult to measure because of the low natural abundance <lb/>of p-nuclei. The E1 and M 1 γ strength functions below <lb/>neutron threshold in the tail of GDR are of unique as-<lb/>trophysical significance because they contribute to pho-<lb/>todisintegration of nuclei in low-lying excited states that <lb/>are thermally populated in stellar conditions. The stellar <lb/>photodisintegration rate is larger by two to three orders of <lb/>magnitude than the laboratory photodisintegration rate <lb/>for a nucleus in the ground state. The reliability of the <lb/>statistical model calculation is further enhanced if neu-<lb/>tron optical potentials and nuclear level densities are con-<lb/>strained in different experiments like neutron capture, etc. <lb/>We limit the s-process study by means of photodis-<lb/>integration to radioactive nuclei for which neutron cap-<lb/>ture leads to stable nuclei. In particular, photodisinte-<lb/>gration is the most efficient way to constrain the neu-<lb/>tron capture cross section for short-lived nuclei like <lb/> 185  W <lb/>(t  1/2  = 75 d) [7,8]. There are many such short-lived nu-<lb/>clei to study. Recently, neutron capture cross sections are <lb/>measured for <lb/> 151  Sm with a half-life of 90 years at n-TOF <lb/>of CERN [9]. It was proposed [10] to measure photodis-<lb/>integration cross sections for <lb/> 152  Sm by scanning across <lb/>low-lying excited states of the residual <lb/> 151  Sm nucleus in <lb/>order to get insight into the stellar enhancement factor. <lb/>Photoneutron cross sections so far measured with the <lb/>LCS γ beams are categorized into the three groups as <lb/>follows: <lb/> – (a) p-process nuclei: <lb/> 93  Nb, <lb/> 139  La, <lb/> 181  Ta [6]; <lb/> – (b) s-process nuclei: <lb/> 80  Se, <lb/> 108  Pd, <lb/> 141  Pr, <lb/> 152  Sm, <lb/> 186  W [8,11], <lb/> 187  Re [11], and <lb/> 188  Os [11]; <lb/> – (c) light nuclei: D [12], <lb/> 9  Be [13]. <lb/>A new photon source that is ideally suited to a system-<lb/>atic p-process study is under development at SPring-8 [14]. <lb/>A beam of 8 GeV electrons passing through a 10 tesla su-<lb/>perconducting wiggler (SCW) produces high-energy syn-<lb/>chrotron radiation that mimics blackbody spectra at tem-<lb/>peratures of billions of kelvin. It is shown that this SCW <lb/>radiation can be used to determine laboratory photore-<lb/>action rates not only for (γ, n) but for (γ, α) and (γ, p) <lb/>reactions. <lb/> 2 Direct determination of (γ,n) cross sections <lb/> 2.1 p-process <lb/> Among 35 nuclei classically referred to as p-nuclei, there <lb/>are two rare odd-odd nuclei: <lb/> 138  La (Z = 57, N = 81) <lb/>and <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> m  (Z = 73, N = 107). The p-process origin of <lb/> 180  Ta, the only naturally occurring isomer and the rarest <lb/>nucleus in the solar system, was investigated with focus on <lb/>its production cross-sections of <lb/> 181  Ta(γ, n) <lb/> 180  Ta [6]. Using <lb/>a stellar rate constrained by the experimental cross sec-<lb/>tions, a 25 M   type-II supernova (SN-II) model with solar <lb/>metalicity has confirmed that <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> m  is a natural product <lb/> 8 <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>1 2 <lb/>1 4 <lb/>1 6 <lb/> σ  (mb) <lb/> E (MeV) <lb/> 139 La(γ,n) <lb/> 138 <lb/> La <lb/> 141 Pr(γ,n) <lb/> 140 Pr <lb/> 400 <lb/>300 <lb/>200 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>300 <lb/>200 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/> Fig. 1.

The upper limit of the rate <lb/>(λ <lb/>  * <lb/> (γn)  = 42 s <lb/> −1  ) is given by the Lorentzian-type model, <lb/>while the lower limit (λ <lb/>  * <lb/> (γn)  = 12 s <lb/> −1  ), which is the previ-<lb/>ous standard value [18], by the HFBCS + QRPA model. <lb/>The large uncertainty arises from different energy depen-<lb/>dences of the three different models of the γ strength func-<lb/>tion below the neutron threshold. <lb/>To cure the underproduction problem completely <lb/>within the p-process scenario of SNe-II, it is required <lb/>that an increase in the production of <lb/></body>

			<body> complemented by a decrease in its destruction, resulting <lb/>in a total enhancement factor of 20–25 [18]. The upper <lb/>limit of the present rate may increase the stellar photo-<lb/>production rate of <lb/> 138  La by a factor of 3.5. The com-<lb/>plementary decrease is however unlikely from the view-<lb/>point of a consistency in calculating the production and <lb/>the destruction with the same model; for example, the <lb/>Lorentzian model of the E1 γ strength function, which <lb/>could increase the production rate, increases the destruc-<lb/>tion rate simultaneously. Therefore, the p-process in SNe-<lb/>II is not favored to explain a significant fraction of the so-<lb/>lar <lb/> 138  La abundance. However, no definite conclusion can <lb/>be drawn until the destruction rate of <lb/> 138  La is constrained <lb/>experimentally. A future measurement of <lb/> 138  La(γ, n) <lb/> 137  La <lb/>cross sections would be a challenge to experimentalists. <lb/> 2.2 s-process <lb/> Photodisintegration cross sections were measured for <lb/> 186  W, <lb/> 187  Re and <lb/> 188  Os, of which those for <lb/> 188  Os were <lb/>used to address a major uncertainty involved in the Re-<lb/>Os cosmochronology [11]: namely, the correction factor <lb/> F  σ  for the contribution of the 9.5 keV state in <lb/> 187  Os to <lb/>the stellar neutron capture rate [27,28,29,30]. Figure 2 <lb/>shows the present data in comparison with the data taken <lb/>previously [31,32,33]. The result of the Hauser-Feshbach <lb/>(HF) model calculations with different models of the E1 <lb/>γ strength function, the level density, and the neutron op-<lb/>tical potential are also shown in the figure. The Hartree-<lb/>Fock + BCS (HFBCS) [34] and the back-shifted Fermi <lb/>gas (BSFG) [35] models were used for the level density; <lb/>The HFBCS + quasi-particle random phase approxima-<lb/>tion [26] (HFBCS + QRPA) and the Hybrid [25] models <lb/>were used for the γ strength function; The JLMB [36] and <lb/>Woods-Saxon [37] optical potentials were used. <lb/>Stellar neutron capture cross sections for <lb/> 187  Os were <lb/>calculated with the HF model parameters constrained by <lb/>the present photodisintegration data and the laboratory <lb/>neutron capture data available for <lb/> 187  Os. Note that in <lb/>this case, the present data sensitive to the E1 γ strength <lb/>function combined with the capture data sensitive to the <lb/>neutron optical potential and the level density can greatly <lb/>improve the reliability of the HF model calculations. Ex-<lb/>cept for the one with the Woods-Saxon potential labeled <lb/>INP-3 in fig. 2, which turned out to significantly under-<lb/>estimate the experimental capture cross sections at low <lb/>energies, all the HF model calculations provided stellar <lb/>capture cross sections with small deviations. Thus, it was <lb/>concluded that F  σ  values at typical s-process temperatures <lb/>(12–30 keV) are in the range of 0.86–0.94. <lb/>We investigated the uncertainty in the age of the <lb/>Galaxy (T  G  ) associated with the constrained F  σ  values <lb/>in the Re-Os chronology. Using the simplest assumption <lb/>of r-process nucleosynthesis yields of <lb/> 187  Re varying expo-<lb/>nentially in time, the probable range of the differential co-<lb/>efficient dT  G  /dF  σ  was found to be −(5.0–12.8) Gyr.

Photodisintegration cross <lb/>sections were measured for <lb/> 186  W to evaluate neutron cap-<lb/>ture cross sections for an s-process branching nucleus <lb/> 185  W <lb/>(t  1/2  = 75 d) [8]. The HF photodisintegration cross sec-<lb/>tions for <lb/> 186  W with two very different statistical ingre-<lb/>dients [7] were scaled to the present experimental cross <lb/>sections with scaling factors being 1.0 and 0.77, respec-<lb/>tively. By employing the same scaling factors for the HF <lb/>neutron capture cross sections, a Maxwellian-averaged <lb/>neutron capture cross section for <lb/> 185  W was evaluated; <lb/> σ = 553 ± 60 mb at kT = 30 keV. <lb/>A discussion parallel to the previous classical-model <lb/>analysis of the s-process flow at <lb/> 185  W gave a higher neu-<lb/>tron density N  n  = 4.7 <lb/> +1.4 <lb/> −1.1  × 10 <lb/> 8  cm <lb/> −3  . This neutron den-<lb/>sity, which is still compatible with the branching at Nd-<lb/>Pm-Sm (A = 147–149) [39], highlights incompatibility <lb/>with the branching at Er-Tm-Yb (A = 169–171) [39] and <lb/>Os-Ir-Pt (A = 191–193) [40]. On the other hand, in a re-<lb/>alistic s-process model the present neutron capture cross <lb/>section for <lb/> 185  W, which is smaller than the previous value <lb/> ≈ 700 mb [7], may enhance the overproduction of the s-<lb/>only nucleus <lb/> 186  Os. <lb/></body>

For comparison, the previous data (open circles) [42] <lb/>taken with the positron annihilation γ-rays is also shown. <lb/> Long-lived radionuclides produced in the s-process are <lb/>also of interest in the field of nuclear waste transmutation. <lb/>The idea of nuclear transmutation is to transform them to <lb/>either stable or short-lived nuclei by means of neutron cap-<lb/>ture. Photodisintegration can be used to evaluate neutron <lb/>capture cross sections for nuclei in the former cases; they <lb/>are <lb/> 36  Cl [3 × 10 <lb/> 6  y], <lb/> 79  Se [6.5 × 10 <lb/> 4  y], <lb/> 93  Zr [1.53 × 10 <lb/> 6  y], <lb/> 107  Pd [6.5 × 10 <lb/> 6  y], <lb/> 151  Sm [90 y]. <lb/> 151  Sm and <lb/> 79  Se are nu-<lb/>clei at which s-process branching takes place in the main <lb/>and weak s-process flows, respectively. Note that the ter-<lb/>restrial decay rate of <lb/> 79  Se is shortened by four orders of <lb/>magnitudes in the stellar condition at temperatures higher <lb/>than 1 × 10 <lb/> 8  K due to decay from excited states [41]. <lb/>Photodisintegration cross sections were measured for <lb/> 80  Se, <lb/> 108  Pd, and <lb/> 152  Sm from the viewpoint of astrophysics <lb/>and nuclear transmutation. Figure 3 shows results of the <lb/>measurement for <lb/> 80  Se. The present data significantly dif-<lb/>fer from the data taken with the positron annihilation <lb/> γ-rays [42]. <lb/> 2.3 Light nuclei <lb/> Photodisintegration of light nuclei is of particular interest <lb/>because it is directly connected to inverse radiative cap-<lb/>ture by the reciprocity theorem. <lb/> 9  Be and D are two good <lb/>examples [13,12]; the inverse αα(n, γ) <lb/> 9  Be reaction fol-<lb/>lowed by <lb/> 9  Be(α, n) is considered to be most efficient in pro-<lb/>ducing <lb/> 12  C in the so-called neutrino-driven wind of SNe-II, <lb/>dominating over the triple α reaction [43], while p(n, γ)D <lb/> belongs to big bang nucleosynthesis, producing the sim-<lb/>plest two-nucleon system. Photodisintegration is an exclu-<lb/>sive way to study the three-body reaction, where real pho-<lb/>tons strongly excited the E1 resonance state (1/2 <lb/> +  ) in <lb/> 9  Be <lb/>immediately above the n + <lb/> 8  Be threshold. In contrast, vir-<lb/>tual photons in the electron backward-scattering favored <lb/> M 1 excitation [44]. On the other hand, it is a unique way <lb/>to study the p(n, γ)D reaction, where the measurement <lb/>successfully reduced uncertainties of p(n, γ)D cross sec-<lb/>tions at energies relevant to big bang nucleosynthesis. <lb/> 10 <lb/> -2 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 0 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 2 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 4 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 8 <lb/> 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>1 0 <lb/>Activity [decay/hour] <lb/> Time [day] <lb/> 180 Ta <lb/> 179 Ta <lb/> Fig. 4. The radioactivity of <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> gs  and <lb/> 179  Ta expected to be <lb/>produced by irradiating 10 natural tantalum foils of 100 μm <lb/> thickness each with the SCW radiation for 100 hours. <lb/> New measurements are planned for photodisintegra-<lb/>tion of D to determine 1) total p(n, γ)D cross sections at <lb/>neutron energies below 100 keV and 2) partial cross sec-<lb/>tions for s-wave and p-wave neutron capture. The former <lb/>measurement is characterized by a long D  2  O target ex-<lb/>tending across the polyethylene moderator, intense LCS γ <lb/> beams with energies varied in a small step near the n + p <lb/>threshold, and a photon difference method for data reduc-<lb/>tion. Previously, a measurement of the photon analyzing <lb/>power was carried out in photodisintegration of deuterons <lb/>using linearly polarized γ beams at the Duke facility [45]. <lb/>The analyzing power data was used to determine relative <lb/> E1 and M 1 strengths of the photodisintegration cross sec-<lb/>tion. In the new measurement, we plan to utilize linearly <lb/>polarized LCS photons and fast (liquid scintillator) and <lb/>slow ( <lb/> 3  He + polyethylene) neutron detectors to determine <lb/>absolute strengths of M 1 and E1 cross sections from neu-<lb/>tron angular distributions as well as the analyzing power. <lb/> 3 Perspectives <lb/> 3.1 Determination of photodisintegration rates <lb/> A 10 tesla superconducting wiggler is under development <lb/>as an insertion light source at SPring-8. This light source <lb/>produces high-energy synchrotron radiations with equiv-<lb/>alent blackbody spectra at temperatures of billions of <lb/>kelvin [14]. Recently, a study was made of using the SCW <lb/>radiation to determine (γ, n) reaction rates. Photode-<lb/>struction of the nature&apos;s rarest isotope <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> m  with the <lb/>natural abundance of 0.012% will be the most challenging <lb/>experiment. Irradiation of natural tantalum foils with the <lb/>intense beam of the SCW blackbody radiation produces <lb/> 179  Ta [t  1/2  = 1.82 y] less by a factor of the order of 10,000 <lb/>than <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> gs  [8.15 h] because of the unbalanced natural <lb/>abundances. Figure 4 shows the expected radioactivity of <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> gs  and <lb/> 179  Ta produced under a proper irradiation <lb/>condition [14]. Because of the very different half-lives, <lb/>the radioactivity of <lb/> 180  Ta <lb/> gs  decreases at the same level <lb/></body>

			<body> as <lb/> 179  Ta in the first 6 days and is below 1/1,000 in the <lb/>next 4 days, while the activity of <lb/> 179  Ta remains the same <lb/>(∼ 50 decays per hour) during this period. After a proper <lb/>cooling time of about 10 days, specific hafnium KX-rays <lb/>(K  α1  : 59.32 keV, K  α2  : 57.98 keV) emitted in the EC of <lb/> 179  Ta can be measured under a low-radiation background. <lb/>Very recently a feasibility study was extended to (γ, α) <lb/> and (γ, p) reactions. The event rate N (t) is expressed by <lb/> N (t) = a  t <lb/> σ(ε)n  γ  (ε, T ) dε. <lb/>(1) <lb/>Here a  t  is the areal number density of target nuclei [cm <lb/> −2  ], <lb/> σ(ε) is the photoreaction cross section for the emission of <lb/>alpha particles or protons [cm <lb/> 2  ], n  γ  (ε, T ) is a flux of the <lb/>black-body radiation at temperature T which is equiva-<lb/>lent to the SCW synchrotron radiation [s <lb/> −1  ]. Note that <lb/> T = 4.4 × 10 <lb/> 9  K at the magnetic field of 10 tesla. The <lb/>Gamow peak appears as a maximum in the integrand of <lb/>eq. (1). The range of α particles and protons with the most <lb/>probable energy defined at the Gamow peak was used to <lb/>calculate a  t  . Of the 233 reactions with cross sections com-<lb/>piled in [46] in the feasibility study, we found 35 (γ, α) <lb/> and 36 (γ, p) reactions with the event rate larger than <lb/>10 counts per hour. For example, in the <lb/> 96  Ru(γ, α) <lb/> 92  Mo <lb/>reaction the followings are obtained: <lb/> – The integral: 1.24 × 10 <lb/> −21  [cm <lb/> 2  s <lb/> −1  ], <lb/> – The most probable α energy: 7.8 MeV, <lb/> – Range in Ru: 12.4 [μm], <lb/> – a  t  : 1.22 × 10 <lb/> 20  [cm <lb/> −2  ], <lb/> – Event rate: 5.43 × 10 <lb/> 2  [h <lb/> −1  ]. <lb/>There are several interesting cases ( <lb/> 74  Se, <lb/> 96  Ru, <lb/> 144  Nd, <lb/> 152  Gd), where a theoretical relation between (γ, α) and <lb/>(α, γ) measurements can be investigated. Most of the <lb/>(γ, α) reactions produce stable nuclei so that a direct <lb/>counting of emitted α-particles is necessary. The direct <lb/>counting is possible by mounting target foils sufficiently <lb/>thinner than the particle range inside a vacuum chamber <lb/>and by surrounding each foil with particle detectors. <lb/> 3.2 Call for international collaborations <lb/> Since photonuclear reactions have a variety of important <lb/>facets in astrophysics, international collaborations in the <lb/>following research categories can be called. <lb/>1) p-process: photodisintegration measurements, that are <lb/>currently limited to (γ, n) reactions, need to be ex-<lb/>tended to an unexplored field of (γ, α) and (γ, p) reac-<lb/>tions. Measurements of E1 and M 1 γ strength func-<lb/>tions in nuclear fluorescence experiments should be ad-<lb/>dressed in the context of nuclear astrophysics: that is, <lb/>photonuclear reactions on excited states under stellar <lb/>conditions. <lb/>2) s-process: Photodisintegration plays a complementary <lb/>role to neutron capture in the s-process study for <lb/>radioactive nuclei. For example, a complementary role <lb/>is seen in (γ, n) for <lb/> 152  Sm [stable] and (n, γ) for <lb/> 151  Sm <lb/>[t  1/2  = 90 y] as discussed in sect. 2.2. In particular, <lb/>photodisintegration provides a unique opportunity to <lb/>evaluate neutron-capture cross sections for short-lived <lb/>nuclei provided that neutron capture leads to stable <lb/>nuclei. One can find many nuclei in the chart of <lb/>nuclides for a systematic study, e.g., <lb/> 64  Cu [12.7 h], <lb/> 65  Zn [244 d], <lb/> 70  Ga [21.2 min], <lb/> 71  Ge [11.4 d], <lb/> 74  As <lb/>[17.8 d] etc. Although the E1 γ strength function is <lb/>best probed by photodisintegration, remaining sources <lb/>of uncertainties in the statistical model calculation <lb/>are the neutron optical potential and the nuclear level <lb/>density. If these quantities could be probed in separate <lb/>experiments, the predictive power of the statistical <lb/>model would be greatly improved. <lb/>3) light nuclei: Photodisintegration of light nuclei is a <lb/>straightforward way to study inverse radiative capture <lb/>based on the reciprocity theorem. Deuterium is a good <lb/>research objective, where ∼ 100% linearly-polarized <lb/>photons can be used to separate the E1 and M 1 <lb/>components of photodisintegration and thus the <lb/>corresponding s-wave and p-wave neutron captures by <lb/>proton. <lb/>4) photon sources and experimental technique: There <lb/>are four fundamental factors for photon sources: <lb/>intensity, monochromaticity, polarization, and energy <lb/>variableness. An attempt of producing monochro-<lb/>matic γ-rays at the Institute Laue-Langevin utilizes <lb/>neutron-capture γ-rays produced at the reactor and <lb/>a bent Si 220 crystal as a monochromator [47]. <lb/>The 10 tesla superconducting wiggler at SPring-8 <lb/>with another unique feature of being equivalent to <lb/> blackbody radiation would allow one to determine <lb/>photoreaction rates not only for (γ, n) reactions [14] <lb/>but also for (γ, α) and (γ, p) reactions. <lb/>5) theory and astrophysical modeling: Although impor-<lb/>tant effort has been devoted in the last decades to <lb/>measure reaction cross sections, theoretical predictions <lb/>play a crucial role in the estimate of the reaction rates <lb/>on stable as well as unstable nuclei for astrophysics <lb/>applications. The nuclear ingredients to the reaction <lb/>models, i.e. nuclear structure properties, optical model <lb/>potentials, nuclear level densities, γ-ray strengths, <lb/>should preferentially be estimated from microscopic <lb/>global predictions based on sound and reliable nuclear <lb/>models which, in turn, can compete with more phe-<lb/>nomenological highly-parametrized models in the re-<lb/>production of experimental data. Well-targeted exper-<lb/>iments are of prime importance to properly constrain <lb/>theoretical models and consequently decrease the un-<lb/>certainties in the predictions of astrophysics interest. <lb/>A special care should be paid to the definition of the <lb/>priorities and the sensitivity of the astrophysics observ-<lb/>ables to the nuclear ingredients. The relevance of the <lb/>nuclear inputs should be dictated by astrophysics sim-<lb/>ulations which needs to be based on the state-of-the-<lb/>art models for each problem considered. A simultane-<lb/>ous effort to improve astrophysics models is required. <lb/> This work was supported by the Japan Society of the Promo-<lb/>tion of Science (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), (C)) <lb/></body>

In stars, four hydrogen nuclei are converted into a helium nucleus in two competing nuclear <lb/>fusion processes, namely the proton-proton chain (p-p chain) and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) <lb/>cycle. For temperatures above 20 million kelvin, the CNO cycle dominates energy production, and its rate <lb/>is determined by the slowest process, the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O radiative capture reaction. This reaction proceeds <lb/>through direct and resonant capture into the ground state and several excited states in <lb/> 15  O. High energy <lb/>data for capture into each of these states can be extrapolated to stellar energies using an R-matrix fit. The <lb/>results from several recent extrapolation studies are discussed. A new experiment at the LUNA (Laboratory <lb/>for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) 400 kV accelerator in Italy&apos;s Gran Sasso laboratory measures the <lb/>total cross section of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction with a windowless gas target and a 4π BGO summing <lb/>detector, down to center of mass energies as low as 70 keV. After reviewing the characteristics of the <lb/>LUNA facility, the main features of this experiment are discussed, as well as astrophysical scenarios where <lb/>cross section data in the energy range covered have a direct impact, without any extrapolation. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.20.+f Hydrostatic stellar nucleosynthesis – 29.17.+w Electro-<lb/>static, collective, and linear accelerators – 29.30.Kv X-and γ-ray spectroscopy <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Stars generate energy and synthesize chemical elements in <lb/>thermonuclear reactions [1]. Initially, hydrogen is burned <lb/>to helium, and then, depending on the mass and chemi-<lb/>cal composition of the star, also heavier elements can be <lb/>synthesized. <lb/>Hydrogen burning in stars can proceed through sev-<lb/>eral different mechanisms, namely the proton-proton chain <lb/>(p-p chain), several catalytic cycles called the CNO <lb/>(carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) cycles [2] I, II, III, and the <lb/>Hot-CNO cycle, the neon-sodium and the magnesium-<lb/> a  e-mail: bemmerer@pd.infn.it <lb/> aluminium cycle [1]. The p-p I chain (in the following text <lb/>simply called p-p chain) converts four protons into one <lb/> 4  He <lb/>nucleus; it is formed by the following nuclear reactions: <lb/></body>

			<body> The p-p II and III chains also convert four protons into one <lb/> 4  He nucleus, but are much less likely than the p-p I chain, <lb/>at solar temperature [3] but also at higher temperatures. <lb/>The CNO cycles I and II are given by the following <lb/>chains of reactions, respectively: <lb/> 12  C(p, γ) <lb/> 13  N(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 13  C(p, γ) <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C, <lb/> 15  N(p, γ) <lb/> 16  O(p, γ) <lb/> 17  F(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 17  O(p, α) <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O(β <lb/> +  ) <lb/> 15  N. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1. The rate of energy generation of the three most impor-<lb/>tant mechanisms of stellar hydrogen burning. The temperature <lb/>of the transitions between the three regimes shown depends on <lb/>the density and chemical composition of the star. Some rele-<lb/>vant stellar burning scenarios [5] are indicated in the figure. <lb/> Fig. 2. The reactions of the CNO cycle [1]. Given are the <lb/>NACRE [4] thermonuclear reaction rates NAσv in <lb/> cm <lb/> 3 <lb/> mol·s <lb/> at <lb/>the temperature at the center of our sun (T6 = 16). <lb/> These two cycles, as well as the less likely CNO cycles III <lb/>and IV [1], also burn four protons into one <lb/> 4  He nucleus. <lb/>At higher stellar temperatures, the CNO cycles are sup-<lb/>planted by the so-called Hot-CNO cycles. The onset of the <lb/>Hot-CNO cycles takes place when radiative capture on an <lb/>unstable nuclide in the regular CNO cycles proceeds more <lb/>rapidly than the β <lb/> +  decay of the same nuclide. <lb/>To give some approximate numbers, at low tempera-<lb/>tures, T  6  &lt; 20 (T  6  indicates the temperature of the burn-<lb/>ing site in the star in 10 <lb/> 6  K), energy production is dom-<lb/>inated by the p-p chain (fig. 1). For 20 &lt; T  6  &lt; 130, the <lb/>CNO cycle I (for simplicity just called the CNO cycle) <lb/>dominates, for a chemical composition like that of our sun. <lb/>At T  6  ≈ 130 (for a typical density of 100 <lb/> g <lb/>cm  3  ), the rate <lb/>of radiative proton capture on the unstable nuclide <lb/> 13  N <lb/>becomes faster than its β <lb/> +  decay, and the β-limited Hot-<lb/>CNO cycle then dominates energy production. <lb/>Over the entire energy region where the CNO cy-<lb/>cle dominates, the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction is its bottleneck <lb/>(fig. 2). Therefore, the rate of this particular nuclear re-<lb/>action determines the rate of the entire cycle. <lb/>The present work first proposes a nuclear energy range <lb/>of interest for understanding stellar CNO burning. Extrap-<lb/>olations by different authors giving the rate of the CNO <lb/>cycle at stellar energies are then reviewed. The most im-<lb/>portant features of the Laboratory for Underground Nu-<lb/>clear Astrophysics (LUNA) are given. A new experiment <lb/>measuring the total cross section of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O re-<lb/>action at energies E = 70–230 keV <lb/> 1  is presented. The as-<lb/>trophysical impact of directly measured cross sections at <lb/>such low energies is discussed. <lb/>Details of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O cross sections [6,7] ob-<lb/>tained in the experiment described here will be published <lb/>separately. <lb/> 2 Which nuclear energy range is of <lb/>astrophysical interest? <lb/> The rate of energy production in thermonuclear burning <lb/>is obtained from the energy produced per reaction and <lb/>the number of reactions taking place per second, called <lb/>the rate. This Maxwellian averaged thermonuclear reac-<lb/>tion rate is called σv and is obtained by folding the <lb/>Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, calculated for <lb/>the temperature of the star, with the energy-dependent <lb/>nuclear reaction cross section. More precisely, σv is given <lb/>by the relation [1] <lb/> σ = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> ϕ(v) · v · σ(v) dv, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where v is the relative velocity of the two reaction <lb/>partners, ϕ(v) the velocity distribution (given by the <lb/>Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) and σ(v) the nuclear re-<lb/>action cross section. In the following discussion, the cen-<lb/>ter of mass energy E will be used instead of the relative <lb/>velocity v. <lb/> For energies E far below the Coulomb energy, the cross <lb/>section σ(E) of a charged particle induced reaction drops <lb/>steeply with decreasing energy due to the Coulomb barrier <lb/>in the entrance channel: <lb/> σ(E) = <lb/> S(E) <lb/>E <lb/>e <lb/> −2πη  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where S(E) is the astrophysical S-factor [1], and η is the <lb/>Sommerfeld parameter with 2πη = 31.29 Z  1  Z  2 <lb/>  μ <lb/> E  . Here <lb/> Z  1  and Z  2  are the atomic numbers of projectile and target <lb/>nucleus, respectively, μ is the reduced mass (in amu), and <lb/> E is the center of mass energy (in keV). <lb/>The derivative <lb/> dσv <lb/>dE  forms the so-called Gamow peak, <lb/>and its maximum is found at the Gamow energy E  G  .

			<body> Fig. 3. Gamow peaks for the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction in stable <lb/>hydrogen burning scenarios. The peaks have been normalized <lb/>to equal height. The shaded areas cover 90% of the integral <lb/>under the respective Gamow peak. <lb/> Gamow energy is generally much higher than the tem-<lb/>perature k  B  T (k  B  : Boltzmann&apos;s constant) for the star. <lb/>For example at solar temperature, k  B  T = 1.4 keV and <lb/> E  G  = 27 keV for the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction (fig. 3). <lb/>Hydrogen burning in stars on the main sequence of the <lb/>Hertzsprung-Russell diagram [1] takes place at tempera-<lb/>tures of the order of T  6  = 3–100, the latter value for very <lb/>heavy primordial stars [8]. Temperatures of T  6  = 50–80 <lb/>are typical for the hydrogen burning shell of an asymp-<lb/>totic giant branch (AGB) star of mass M = 2M   (M   : <lb/>mass of our Sun) [9]. Higher temperatures are typical for <lb/>explosive scenarios like novae [10] and X-ray bursts, which <lb/>are not discussed here. <lb/>In the most recent solar model BS05 [11], the CNO <lb/>cycle contributes only 0.8% of the solar luminosity, but a <lb/>precise knowledge of its rate at T  6  ≈ 16, the temperature <lb/>at the center of our Sun, can help test stellar evolution <lb/>theory [3]. Low mass stars leave the main sequence in the <lb/>Hertzsprung-Russell diagram towards the end of their life. <lb/>The luminosity at this turnoff point depends on the CNO <lb/>rate and can be used to determine the age of the star [12]; <lb/>the larger the rate, the fainter the turnoff luminosity. This <lb/>can be used to give an independent lower limit on the age <lb/>of the universe [13,14]. The stellar temperature at this <lb/>turnoff point is of the order of T  6  ≈ 20, depending on the <lb/>star to be studied. <lb/>Using the temperatures indicated, one can propose an <lb/>energy range of interest for understanding CNO hydro-<lb/>gen burning for the most important non-explosive stellar <lb/>scenarios (fig. 3). <lb/>The cross section σ(E) has a very low value at the <lb/>resultant energies E = 20–140 keV, σ(E) = 10 <lb/> −22  –10 <lb/> −10 <lb/> barn (eq. (2)). This prevents a direct cross section mea-<lb/>surement in a laboratory at the earth&apos;s surface, where the <lb/>signal to background ratio is too small because of cos-<lb/>mic ray interactions in detector, target, and shield. Hence, <lb/>cross sections are measured at high energies and expressed <lb/>as the astrophysical S-factor from eq. (2). The S-factor is <lb/>then used to extrapolate the data to the relevant Gamow <lb/>peak. Although S(E) varies only slowly with energy for <lb/>the direct nuclear reaction process, resonances and reso-<lb/>nance tails may hinder an extrapolation, resulting in large <lb/>uncertainties [1]. <lb/>Therefore, the primary goal of experimental nuclear <lb/>astrophysics remains to measure the cross section at en-<lb/>ergies inside the Gamow peak, or at least to approach it <lb/>as closely as possible. The Laboratory for Underground <lb/>Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) has been created for this <lb/>purpose. <lb/> 3 The <lb/> 14 N(p, γ) <lb/> 15 O reaction <lb/> 3.1 Situation up to the year 2000 <lb/> Up to the year 2000, there have been many experimental <lb/>studies of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction at low energy (see, <lb/> e.g., [15,16,17,18,19,20]). The energy levels in the <lb/> 15  O <lb/>nucleus are known ([21], fig. 4), and it is also known that <lb/>only capture into the ground state and three excited states <lb/>in <lb/> 15  O, at 5.181, 6.172, and 6.791 MeV, contributes signif-<lb/>icantly to the cross section at astrophysical energies [20]. <lb/>Only one of the above named studies [16] obtained data <lb/>that were at the edge of the astrophysically relevant en-<lb/>ergy region, with 50% statistical uncertainty for the cross <lb/>section values. The other studies offer data only at en-<lb/>ergies above the astrophysical range, and generally, the <lb/> Fig. 4.

			<body> results are extrapolated in the framework of the R-matrix <lb/>model down to stellar energies. The standard cross section <lb/>value used in reaction rate compilations [23,4] is mainly <lb/>based on the data of the comprehensive study by Schröder <lb/> et al. [20] and on the low energy data from ref. [16]. <lb/>After the year 2000, the R-matrix results of Schröder <lb/> et al. [20] have been revised by several works, on theoreti-<lb/>cal [24], indirect [25,26,27,28] and direct experimental [22, <lb/>29] grounds. The most dramatic revision was for capture <lb/>to the ground state in <lb/> 15  O; the following section focuses <lb/>on this particular transition. <lb/> 3.2 Recent R-matrix fits for radiative capture to the <lb/>ground state in <lb/> 15 O <lb/> The capture cross section into the ground state in <lb/> 15  O is determined by destructive interference of direct <lb/>capture amplitudes with resonant capture through the <lb/>6.79 MeV state. <lb/>The direct capture can be parameterized with an <lb/>asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) C [30]. The <lb/>total ANC for capture into the ground state C = <lb/> C  2 <lb/> p  1/2 <lb/> + C  2 <lb/> p  3/2 <lb/> (with two proton orbitals contribut-<lb/>ing) has been experimentally determined through the <lb/> 14  N( <lb/> 3  He, d) <lb/> 15  O reaction in two independent recent stud-<lb/>ies from Triangle Universities (TUNL) in 2002 [26] and <lb/>from Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) in 2003 [27], with <lb/>consistent results (table 1). <lb/>The most important parameter for resonant capture <lb/>to the ground state via the 6.79 MeV state (acting as a <lb/>subthreshold resonance in this case) is the width Γ  γ,6.79 <lb/> of that state. This width has been measured with the <lb/>Doppler shift attenuation method at TUNL in 2001 [25], <lb/>and the obtained value could be confirmed in a Coulomb <lb/>excitation study at RIKEN in 2004 [28] (table 2). <lb/>The LUNA 2004 study [22] measured the cross section <lb/>for capture into the ground state in <lb/> 15  O down to energies <lb/>as low as E = 119 keV, much lower than any previous <lb/>study for this transition, and directly confirmed the re-<lb/>vised extrapolation for the ground state at those energies, <lb/>inside the Gamow peak for some scenarios of stable hydro-<lb/>gen burning. Before, this revision had been based solely <lb/>on theoretical and indirect considerations. In addition, the <lb/>new low-energy data as well as previous data at higher en-<lb/>ergy, up to 2.5 MeV, from ref. [20] <lb/> 2  were used for a new <lb/>R-matrix fit (fig. 5). <lb/>The TUNL 2005 study [29] gave experimental data <lb/>that are consistent with ref. [22], albeit with larger error <lb/>bars. This study used its own experimental data (E = <lb/>187–482 keV for the ground state) also for an R-matrix fit <lb/>(fig. 5), without including higher energy data in their fit. <lb/>For comparison, also the 2003 R-matrix fit by the TAMU <lb/>group [27] that is based on their ANC measurement and <lb/></body>

Both studies had <lb/>left Γ  γ,6.79  as a free parameter to fit their experimental ex-<lb/>citation functions. An analogous approach was used by the <lb/>same two studies regarding the ANC of the ground state, <lb/>where LUNA obtains a 50% higher value than TUNL. The <lb/>2003 R-matrix fit by the TAMU group [27] used a value <lb/>for Γ  γ,6.79  that was very close to experiment, and the ANC <lb/>used for the fit was obtained experimentally in the same <lb/>work. <lb/>In summary, the results of different extrapolations (ta-<lb/>ble 3) differ by more than the standard deviations quoted <lb/>in the individual works, especially for capture into the <lb/>ground state in <lb/> 15  O, but also for capture into the other <lb/>two states contributing significantly, those at 6.172 and <lb/>6.791 MeV. It is therefore worthwhile to attempt a direct <lb/>measurement of the cross section at energies of astrophys-<lb/>ical interest. <lb/> 4 Laboratory for Underground Nuclear <lb/>Astrophysics (LUNA) <lb/> The Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics <lb/>(LUNA) has been designed for cross section measurements <lb/>at energies in or near the Gamow peak. It is located in the <lb/>Gran Sasso underground laboratory (Laboratori Nazionali <lb/>del Gran Sasso, LNGS <lb/> 3  ) in Italy. LUNA uses high current <lb/>accelerators with small energy spread in combination with <lb/>high efficiency detection systems, one of which is described <lb/>below. <lb/>The Gran Sasso facility consists of three experimen-<lb/>tal halls and several connecting tunnels. Its site is pro-<lb/>tected from cosmic rays by a rock cover equivalent to <lb/>3800 m water. This shield suppresses the flux of cosmic <lb/>ray induced muons by six orders of magnitude [32], re-<lb/>sulting in a flux of muon induced neutrons of the order <lb/>of Φ  nμ  ≈ 10 <lb/> −8 n <lb/>cm  2  ·s  [33]. Because of neutrons from (α, n) <lb/></body>

			<body> reactions and spontaneous fission of <lb/> 238  U taking place in <lb/>the surrounding rock and concrete [34], the measured to-<lb/>tal neutron flux is higher, Φ  n  ≈ 4 · 10 <lb/> −6 n <lb/>cm  2  s  [35]. This <lb/>flux is three orders of magnitude below typical values for <lb/>a laboratory at the surface of the earth. <lb/>This unique low background environment reduces the <lb/>counting rate at 6.8 MeV in a germanium detector by at <lb/>least a factor 2000, and at 6.5–8.0 MeV in a BGO detec-<lb/>tor by a factor 1600 [36]. For comparison, an active muon <lb/>shield in a laboratory at the surface of the earth can reduce <lb/>the background counting rate by about a factor 10–50 for <lb/> E  γ  = 7–11 MeV [37]. The shield provided by the Gran <lb/>Sasso rock cover therefore offers a clear advantage, in par-<lb/>ticular at high γ energies, but also at low γ energies and <lb/>for particle spectroscopy. <lb/>Taking advantage of the low laboratory background, <lb/>at the 50 kV LUNA1 accelerator [38], the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 3  He, 2p) <lb/> 4  He <lb/>cross section was measured for the first time within its so-<lb/>lar Gamow peak [39,40]. Subsequently, a windowless gas <lb/>target setup and a 4π bismuth germanate (BGO) sum-<lb/>ming detector [41] have been used to study the radiative <lb/>capture reaction <lb/> 2  H(p, γ) <lb/> 3  He, also within its solar Gamow <lb/>peak [42]. <lb/>The 400 kV LUNA2 accelerator [43] has been used to <lb/>study the radiative capture reaction <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O using ti-<lb/>tanium nitride (TiN) solid targets and a high purity ger-<lb/>manium detector. The cross sections for the transitions <lb/>to several states in <lb/> 15  O, including the ground state, were <lb/>measured down to E = 119 keV [44,22,45]. <lb/>In order to extend the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O cross section data <lb/>to even lower energies, a gas target setup similar to the <lb/>one used for the <lb/> 2  H(p, γ) <lb/> 3  He study and an annular BGO <lb/>detector have been installed at the LUNA2 400 kV accel-<lb/>erator [46]. <lb/> 5 LUNA <lb/> 14 N(p, γ) <lb/> 15 O gas target experiment <lb/> A new measurement of the total cross section of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction [6,7] has been performed in the <lb/>Gran Sasso underground laboratory, at the LUNA2 <lb/>400 kV accelerator [43]. The main features of the experi-<lb/>ment are described in this section. <lb/> 5.1 Setup <lb/> A schematic view of the setup is displayed in fig. 6. A <lb/>three stage, differentially pumped, windowless gas target <lb/>system (figs. 6 and 7) has been used.

The first pumping stage is <lb/>evacuated by a WS 2000 roots blower, leading to a pres-<lb/>sure ratio between target and first pumping stage that is <lb/>better than a factor 100. The second and third pumping <lb/>stages are at 10 <lb/> −5  and 10 <lb/> −6  mbar pressure, respectively. <lb/> 5.2 Target density <lb/> The target density without and with ion beam has been <lb/>investigated in a dedicated study [47,6, 7]. The target pres-<lb/>sure was monitored with a capacitance pressure gauge <lb/>with precision 0.1% and kept constant with a feedback <lb/>system. The pressure profile within the target has been <lb/>measured with similar precision and is flat to 4%. The <lb/>temperature profile without incident ion beam has been <lb/>measured to better than 1 K. To study the target density <lb/>with an ion beam incident on the target, a collimated NaI <lb/>detector was placed at an angle of 90 <lb/> •  to the beam direc-<lb/>tion directly next to the target chamber, and the energy <lb/>loss ΔE  exp  of the ion beam inside the target chamber was <lb/>measured with the resonance scan technique [48] using the <lb/> E  p  = 278 keV resonance in the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O reaction. The <lb/>experiment was repeated for different pressures and beam <lb/>currents I  target  (fig. 8). <lb/>For high target pressure, therefore high power deposi-<lb/>tion per unit length in the target, there is a large relative <lb/>effect on ΔE  exp  .

Consistent with the conclusions of ref. [48], the <lb/>relative change in density was found to be proportional to <lb/>the power deposited per unit length, which in the present <lb/>case of small lateral straggling of the ion beam corresponds <lb/>to the power deposited per unit volume. <lb/> 5.3 Beam intensity <lb/> The intensity of the ion beam was measured with a <lb/>calorimeter with constant temperature gradient [41].

This selection of the ROI renders the de-<lb/>tection efficiency independent of the branching ratios for <lb/>capture to the ground state and to the state at 6.791 MeV, <lb/>and only weakly dependent on the branching ratio for cap-<lb/>ture to the state at 6.172 MeV. The efficiency depends <lb/>more strongly on the branching ratio for capture to the <lb/>state at 5.181 MeV, but the impact is small because of the <lb/>low value of the branching to this state: 3.6% branching <lb/>at the lowest measured point [45], and 0.8% extrapolated <lb/>at zero energy [20]. Overall, the assumptions on these four <lb/>branching ratios contribute 0.5% to the uncertainty in the <lb/>detection efficiency. <lb/>The γ-ray detection efficiency for radiative capture <lb/>to the states at 7.276 and 6.859 MeV in <lb/> 15  O (fig. 4, ex-<lb/>trapolated branching at zero energy 1 and 2%, respec-<lb/>tively [20]) is 20% lower than for capture to the state <lb/>at 6.791 MeV, because those states decay to the ground <lb/>state via the 5.241 MeV state. The efficiency for capture <lb/>into the 5.241 MeV state (extrapolated branching at zero <lb/>energy 1% [20]) shows the same behavior. Capture into <lb/>the three states at 7.276, 6.859 and 5.241 MeV in <lb/> 15  O has <lb/>been neglected in the present experiment. If one assumes <lb/>three times higher branching ratios at low energy for these <lb/> Fig. 11.

For the primary γ-rays shown in fig. 10, <lb/>theory predicts Legendre coefficients a  2  &lt; 0 or a  2  = 0 for <lb/>incident s- and p-waves. The data show all primary γ-rays <lb/> to be isotropic within errors, with the exception of that <lb/>from capture to the state at 6.791 MeV, where a  2  ≈ −0.8 <lb/> below the resonance. For all primary and secondary tran-<lb/>sitions, below the resonance the a  1  coefficient was found <lb/>to be zero within errors [50]. <lb/>An anisotropy with a  2  &lt; 0 enhances emission per-<lb/>pendicular to the beam direction and therefore the detec-<lb/>tion efficiency for the low energy primary γ-ray, increasing <lb/>the probability of it being detected in coincidence with <lb/>the corresponding secondary γ-ray. For capture into the <lb/>states at 6.791 and 6.172 MeV, the angular distribution <lb/>of the primary γ-rays, while changing the shape of the <lb/>spectrum, does not affect the detection efficiency, because <lb/>the selection of the ROI ensures detection of both the sec-<lb/>ondary and the sum peak. For capture into the ground <lb/>state (where theory predicts isotropy) and into the state <lb/>at 5.182 MeV, there is an effect, but it is diluted because <lb/>of the relatively small branching of those two states (com-<lb/>bined less than 20%). The overall impact of the angular <lb/>distributions on the detection efficiency is smaller than <lb/>3% without theoretical input and negligible when taking <lb/>theory into account. <lb/>Using these inputs, the γ-ray detection efficiency η  γ <lb/> can then be calculated for each point in the target, taking <lb/>the solid angle and the effective detector thickness into <lb/>account [6], with corrections for the attenuation of γ-rays <lb/> in the vacuum vessel, the massive brass collimator and <lb/>the massive copper beam stop. For the example shown in <lb/>fig. 13, the detection efficiency is η  γ  = 0.592 ± 0.020, with <lb/>the uncertainty given by the radioactive source used for <lb/>the calibration (1.5%), the detector modeling (1%, [41]) <lb/>and the branching ratios discussed above (1%). <lb/> 5.5 Gamma-ray spectra and background <lb/> Using a dedicated setup, the γ-ray background has been <lb/>studied previously to the actual experiment, identifying <lb/>and localizing the major background sources [36,6]. Typi-<lb/>cal γ-ray spectra from the 4π BGO summing detector are <lb/>shown in fig. 11, with the region of interest (ROI) for the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O study shaded in the (N  2  ) spectrum. <lb/>For E  γ  &lt; 4 MeV, the spectrum is dominated by the <lb/>laboratory background, whose counting rate in the ROI <lb/>is constant and well known [36]. At higher γ-energies, the <lb/>background induced by the ion beam is for most runs more <lb/>important than the laboratory background. Background <lb/>induced by the <lb/> 13  C(p, γ) <lb/> 14  N reaction (Q = 7.551 MeV) <lb/>leads to 7.7 MeV γ-rays, superimposed with the sum peak <lb/>from the reaction to be studied. In order to evaluate the <lb/>contribution from this reaction, monitor runs with helium <lb/>gas in the target were performed at the same beam energy. <lb/>The resulting monitor spectrum is then renormalized for <lb/>equal charge with the nitrogen spectrum and for equal <lb/>energy of the proton beam when arriving at the beam <lb/>stop, where the <lb/> 13  C background originates ((He) spectrum <lb/>in fig. 11). <lb/>In the nitrogen (N  2  ) spectrum, the dominating peak <lb/>in the ROI (fig. 12) is the sum peak at E  γ  = Q + E. To <lb/>the left of it are unresolved lines at 6.172 and 6.791 MeV, <lb/>the energies of the secondary γ-rays. Outside the ROI, the <lb/>peak at 5 MeV (fig. 11) is mostly from the secondary γ-ray <lb/> at 5.181 MeV from the reaction to be studied, but partly <lb/>also from the <lb/> 2  H(p, γ) <lb/> 3  He beam induced background re-<lb/>action, as is revealed by the helium monitor run. <lb/>The broad structure at 12 MeV in the N  2  spectrum <lb/>(fig. 11) results mainly from the <lb/> 15  N(p, γ) <lb/> 16  O reaction (the <lb/>target gas has natural isotopic composition, 0.4% <lb/> 15  N), <lb/>but also from the <lb/> 11  B(p, γ) <lb/> 12  C beam induced background <lb/>reaction. This last reaction also gives γ-rays at 16 MeV. <lb/>All reactions leading to γ-rays of E  γ  &gt; 8 MeV [36] cause a <lb/>small Compton continuum at lower energies. Its contribu-<lb/>tion is evaluated from a global fit to the helium monitor <lb/>runs (after <lb/> 13  C correction), and a correction factor is de-<lb/>duced, so that the high energy counts in each spectrum are <lb/>used to calculate the Compton background for that same <lb/>spectrum [6]. Finally, single lines from resonant back-<lb/>ground reactions producing γ-rays in the ROI [36] were fit-<lb/>ted and subtracted for runs close to the resonance energy. <lb/> 5.6 Data analysis <lb/> With the γ-ray detection efficiency η  γ  , the effective target <lb/>density n and therefore also the energy loss of the ion <lb/></body>

In the present experi-<lb/>ment, as a first step the analysis has been performed un-<lb/>der the assumption of an S-factor that is constant over <lb/>the energy interval given by the energy loss in the target. <lb/>In a second step, the obtained energy dependence of the <lb/> S-factor has been used as input for the renewed analysis. <lb/>Using this method, total cross section data with sta-<lb/>tistical uncertainties better than 10% has been obtained <lb/>in the energy range E = 70–230 keV, energies lower than <lb/>any previous study. <lb/> 6 Astrophysical scenarios that can be better <lb/>understood using data from the present <lb/>experiment <lb/> The data obtained in the present experiment [6,7] can <lb/>be used to directly evaluate the reaction rate for several <lb/>important stellar scenarios, with negligible impact from <lb/>the extrapolation applied for lower energies. <lb/>The derivative <lb/> dσv <lb/>dE  of the reaction rate from eq. (1) <lb/>has been calculated from the LUNA gas target experimen-<lb/>tal S-factor data [6], assuming a flat S-factor equal to the <lb/> S-factor at E = 70 keV for E &lt; 70 keV, where there is no <lb/>data (fig. 14). For temperatures T  6  ≥ 60, the data from the <lb/>present experiment cover more than 50% of the Gamow <lb/>peak, for 90 ≤ T  6  ≤ 300, more than 90% of the Gamow <lb/>peak, when one includes the strength of the E = 259 keV <lb/>resonance that was also measured in the LUNA gas target <lb/>experiment [7]. <lb/>Low mass stars burn first hydrogen and then helium <lb/>in their center. After the end of the helium burning phase, <lb/>the star consists of a degenerate core of oxygen and carbon <lb/>and two shells burning hydrogen and helium, respectively. <lb/>This phase of stellar evolution is called the asymptotic <lb/>giant branch (AGB) [51]. It is characterized by flashes of <lb/>the helium burning shell that spawn convective mixing in <lb/>a process called dredge-up. Such a dredge-up transports <lb/>the products of nuclear burning from inner regions of the <lb/> Fig. 14. Gamow peaks for several stellar temperatures dis-<lb/>cussed in the text. The horizontal bars correspond to the en-<lb/>ergy range where direct experimental data has been obtained <lb/>in the study by Schröder et al. 1987 [20], the LUNA solid tar-<lb/>get experiment 2004 [22], the TUNL 2005 study [29], and the <lb/>LUNA gas target experiment (present work). <lb/> star to its surface, where they are in principle accessible <lb/>to astronomical observations. <lb/>The temperature in the hydrogen burning shell of an <lb/>AGB star is of the order of T  6  = 50–80 for the example of a <lb/>2 M   star with metallicity Z = 0.01. It has been shown [9] <lb/>that an arbitrary 25% reduction of the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O rate <lb/>with respect to the NACRE [4] rate leads to twice as <lb/>efficient dredge-up of carbon to the surface of the star, <lb/>because the rate of energy generation in the hydrogen <lb/>burning shell becomes even lower than before, enhancing <lb/>the disequilibrium between hydrogen and helium burning <lb/>shell. The CNO rate suggested by the present study [6,7] is <lb/>more than 25% below the NACRE [4] rate. Recent experi-<lb/>mental data on the carbon producing triple-α reaction [52] <lb/>result in a 10–20% decrease of its rate at temperatures rel-<lb/>evant for helium shell burning, leading to a slightly lower <lb/>production of carbon, reducing in a commensurate de-<lb/>crease of the amount of carbon transported to the stel-<lb/>lar surface [9]. Still, the change in the <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O rate <lb/>might lift a disagreement between model and observation <lb/>for so-called carbon stars [53]: For low (i.e. 2 M   ) mass <lb/>stars, models do not reproduce a sufficiently high dredge-<lb/>up efficiency. <lb/>Recently, a simulation for a 5 M   , Z = 0.02 AGB <lb/>star [54] found stronger thermal flashes for a reduced CNO <lb/>rate, consistent with the finding of ref. [9] for a 2 M   , <lb/> Z = 0.01 AGB star. <lb/>For a zero metallicity (population III) star of 1 M   , <lb/>after a sufficient amount of carbon has been created in <lb/>the triple-α reaction, the CNO cycle is ignited in the so <lb/>called CN flash. This CN flash takes place at T  6  ≈ 65 <lb/>and leads to a brief loop of the trajectory of the star in <lb/>the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram [55]. With a CNO rate <lb/>that is 40% lower than the NACRE [4] rate, this loop <lb/>disappears [54]. Also, the first core helium flash in such a <lb/>star was found to be less luminous than in the reference <lb/></body>

The distribution of electromagnetic dipole strength in <lb/> 92, 98, 100  Mo has been investigated by <lb/>photon scattering using bremsstrahlung from the new ELBE facility. The experimental data for well-<lb/>separated nuclear resonances indicate a transition from a regular to a chaotic behaviour above 4 MeV of <lb/>excitation energy. As the strength distributions follow a Porter-Thomas distribution much of the dipole <lb/>strength is found in weak and in unresolved resonances appearing as fluctuating cross section. An analysis <lb/>of this quasi-continuum —here applied to nuclear resonance fluorescence in a novel way— delivers dipole <lb/>strength functions, which are combining smoothly to those obtained from (γ, n) data. Enhancements at <lb/>6.5 MeV and at ∼ 9 MeV are linked to the pygmy dipole resonances postulated to occur in heavy nuclei. <lb/> PACS. 21.10.Pc Single-particle levels and strength functions – 24.10.Lx Monte Carlo simulations (includ-<lb/>ing hadron and parton cascades and string breaking models) – 25.20.Dc Photon absorption and scattering <lb/>– 26.50.+x Nuclear physics aspects of novae, supernovae, and other explosive environments <lb/> 1 Dipole strength in heavy nuclei <lb/> The response of nuclei to dipole radiation is of special im-<lb/>portance for the synthesis of the chemical elements in the <lb/>cosmos: particle thresholds may be crossed in hot or ex-<lb/>plosive scenarios leading to the production of new nuclides <lb/>from previously formed heavier ones by dissociation in the <lb/>thermal photon bath. This is likely to be the main path <lb/>for the generation of the approximately 30–40 neutron-<lb/>deficient nuclides which cannot be produced in neutron <lb/>capture reactions [1]. For the understanding and modelling <lb/>of this so-called p-process the dipole strength function up <lb/>to and near the particle thresholds has to be known ac-<lb/>curately [2]. As shown previously [3], details of the dipole <lb/>strength (now in n-rich nuclei) may as well have large con-<lb/>sequences for the r-process path and also s-process branch-<lb/>ings are influenced by nuclear excitations [4] induced by <lb/>thermal photons. <lb/>The experimental knowledge [5] on dipole strength is <lb/>reasonably well established for many heavy and medium <lb/>mass nuclei in the region of the giant dipole resonance <lb/>(GDR) by (γ, xn) studies, which often also cover the region <lb/>directly above the neutron threshold S  n  . At lower energies <lb/>three features have been discussed to be of importance for <lb/>processes in high-temperature cosmic environments: <lb/>a) the fall-off [6, 7, 8, 9] of the E1-strength on the low-<lb/>energy slope of the GDR; <lb/> a  e-mail: e.grosse@fz-rossendorf.de <lb/> b) the E1-strength between the ground-state (gs) and low <lb/>energy excitations and its proper extension [10,11,12] into <lb/>the regime a); <lb/>c) the occurrence of additional pygmy-resonances, [3, 13, <lb/>14,15], which are assumed to be not as broad as the GDR, <lb/>but wider as compared to the average level distance D <lb/> —thus forming an intermediate structure enclosing many <lb/>levels. Their low energy may well enhance their contribu-<lb/>tion to photo-dissociation processes in spite of their rela-<lb/>tively low strength as compared to the GDR. <lb/>In principle, also M 1-transitions contribute to the <lb/>dipole strength, but the average M 1 strength is typically <lb/>1-2 orders of magnitude smaller as compared to E1, and <lb/>they are frequently [1, 2, 3] not taken into account. <lb/>A further approximation has to be introduced to esti-<lb/>mate dipole strengths for transitions not connected to the <lb/>ground state; there are two possibilities proposed in the <lb/>literature: <lb/>a) Strictly following a hypothesis set up by Brink and <lb/>Axel [16] the strength of a transition connecting in a given <lb/>nucleus two levels separated by an energy difference E  γ <lb/> only depends on E  γ  , on the transition type and on a sta-<lb/>tistical factor determined by the two spins. <lb/>b) As proposed by Kadmenskii [10], a temperature de-<lb/>pendence of the strength function is introduced, which <lb/>smears out the GDR-strength into the region below and <lb/>effectively connects a certain excitation region above the <lb/>ground state to the GDR domain. <lb/></body>

			<body> A combination of the two prescriptions has been <lb/>tried [12], but this suffers from an inconsistency which <lb/>may be of principal nature: At low energy the nuclear ex-<lb/>citation is quantized, whereas with increasing energy sta-<lb/>tistical concepts from thermodynamics are more effective <lb/>in describing the increasing complexity. Microscopic calcu-<lb/>lations [8,11] may allow to develop a consistent transition <lb/>from the low to the high excitation region near the GDR <lb/>and to properly account for other intermediate strength. <lb/> 2 Nuclear resonance fluorescence <lb/> Information about energy-dependent dipole strength func-<lb/>tions can be obtained from data on multi-step gamma-<lb/>decays following n-capture [17] or direct reactions [12], <lb/>from inelastic electron scattering [18] or elastic photon <lb/>scattering [14,15,19]. For the region above the n-threshold <lb/>the electromagnetic strength in a very large number of <lb/>stable nuclei has been experimentally determined by ob-<lb/>serving the neutrons emitted after the excitation by quasi-<lb/>monochromatic photons [5, 20]. Data on this (γ, xn) pro-<lb/>cess, taken as averages over a certain energy bin, allow <lb/>to determine an (averaged) dipole strength function f  1  in <lb/>this region by making use of the relation: <lb/> f  1  (E) = <lb/> 3π <lb/> 2  ¯ h <lb/> 2  c <lb/> 2  E <lb/>  −1  · σ  γ  (E), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where σ  γ  describes the dipole dissociation of a spin 0 tar-<lb/>get by a photon of energy E. The strength function data <lb/>obtained from the other methods suitable for the lower <lb/>excitation energy should connect smoothly to (γ, xn) data <lb/>to yield information about the dipole strength over a wide <lb/>energy range from the ground state up to far above the <lb/>particle emission thresholds. Of special importance here is <lb/>the much discussed [7,10,11,12] question, if the extrapola-<lb/>tion of the Lorentzian fit to the GDR fits dipole strength <lb/>data also at and below the neutron threshold. <lb/>One experimental method has delivered interesting in-<lb/>formation about nuclear dipole strength; results from it <lb/>have become more and more detailed with the improving <lb/>measurements. Using a bremsstrahlung beam the scatter-<lb/>ing of photons with energies up to the GDR is observed by <lb/>large volume Ge-detectors. The good resolution (3–5 keV) <lb/>of such detectors in combination with Compton suppres-<lb/>sion shields limit the detector response matrix such that it <lb/>becomes nearly completely diagonal. Thus the signal from <lb/>elastically scattered photons identifies the energy of the <lb/>incoming photon out of the bremsstrahlung continuum, <lb/>as all nuclear levels with sufficient transition strength to <lb/>the ground state are observed as narrow elastic scattering <lb/>resonances up to the respective neutron emission thresh-<lb/>olds; inelastic scattering to levels above the target ground <lb/>states is also observed [21] and has to be considered in the <lb/>data analysis. <lb/>From the knowledge of inelastic scattering via higher <lb/>lying levels the feeding to a certain level can be accounted <lb/>for in the analysis of the elastic cross section σ  γγ  : <lb/> I(E  R  ) = <lb/> R <lb/> σ  γγ  (E)dE − I  f eed <lb/> (2) <lb/> Fig. 1.

Above a background caused by atomic pro-<lb/>cesses —whose height was determined from a Monte Carlo <lb/>simulation— an accumulation of sharp lines near 7 MeV is ob-<lb/>served as well as a strong quasi-continuum extending up to the <lb/>endpoint energy of ∼ 14 MeV.

(4) only for <lb/>the single line spectra [21] observed below E  R  4 MeV <lb/>with low endpoint bremsstrahlung, the other data require <lb/>a more sophisticated analysis. <lb/>A non-negligible contribution to the scattering results <lb/>from non-nuclear processes as Compton scattering with <lb/>the subsequent bremsstrahlung reaching the detector; pair <lb/>production leads to photon background in a similar way. <lb/>Such processes can be simulated [19] to high accuracy <lb/>and subtracted from the data as shown in figs. 1 and 2, <lb/>to yield the &quot; true &quot; nuclear resonance fluorescence (nrf) <lb/>cross section σ  γγ  to be used in eq. (2). Only the resulting <lb/>difference spectra contain information about the nuclear <lb/>dipole strength. As the direct contributions from Thomson <lb/>and Delbrück scattering are weaker by orders of magni-<lb/>tude, the scattering of MeV photons is primarily nrf. Only <lb/>when Γ  c  completely dominates Γ —e.g., above the neu-<lb/>tron threshold S  n  — can the contribution of these direct <lb/>scattering processes no longer be neglected.

This allows a test of <lb/>the determination of the continuum in the region between the <lb/>two (different) neutron thresholds. <lb/> can be identified through the use of linearly polarized pho-<lb/>tons [22, 23, 24, 25]. <lb/> 3 Photon scattering experiments on Mo <lb/>isotopes <lb/> The present paper reports on photon scattering exper-<lb/>iments for the Mo isotopes with A = 92, 98 and 100. <lb/>This rather wide range in neutron number N may al-<lb/>low a reasonable extrapolation to unstable isotopes; for <lb/>the case of the pygmy resonance the E1-strength has <lb/>been predicted [13] to vary strongly with N whereas its <lb/>energy should weakly depend on N . The low-N stable <lb/>Mo isotopes are p-process nuclides with a surprisingly <lb/>high cosmic abundance thus making accurate informa-<lb/>tion on the response of Mo isotopes to dipole radiation <lb/>especially desirable. The photon scattering experiment at <lb/>the new radiation source ELBE with its superconduct-<lb/>ing electron linac [26] was set up similar to previous nrf-<lb/>studies [13, 14, 15, 27]. One of its special features is, that <lb/>the bremsstrahlung emerges from a thin Nb-foil (approx. <lb/>5 mg/cm <lb/> 2  ) bombarded with a beam of approx. 650 μA = <lb/>4 · 10 <lb/> 15  e/s. The electron beam is deflected into a well-<lb/>shielded beam dump after passing the radiator. Highly <lb/>enriched targets of <lb/> 92  Mo, <lb/> 98  Mo and <lb/> 100  Mo have been used <lb/>with masses of 2-3 g each. Electrons with an average mo-<lb/>mentum of 14 MeV/c and an rms momentum spread of <lb/>0.07 MeV/c were used in these experiments. For each tar-<lb/>get a second run with a lower electron momentum was <lb/>performed such that the endpoint of the bremsstrahlung <lb/>continuum stayed below the neutron and proton emis-<lb/>sion thresholds. The photon beam was limited transversely <lb/>by a 2.5 m long conical Al-collimator, such that an ap-<lb/>proximate photon flux of about 10 <lb/> 7  γ/(s cm <lb/> 2  MeV) hits <lb/>the experimental targets. Four large high-purity germa-<lb/>nium semiconductor detectors (enclosed by anti-Compton <lb/>shields from BGO) set up at 90 <lb/> •  and 127 <lb/> •  registered the <lb/>photons scattered by the target. <lb/>The detectors were shielded from unwanted back-<lb/>ground radiation by lead bricks positioned around the <lb/>photon beam dump, near the collimator exit and around <lb/>the beam tube at the target. A conical opening between <lb/>target and Ge-detector, which was filled by only 2 cm of Pb <lb/>to absorb the very intense low energy photons, determined <lb/>the angle of observation and the solid angle. Details of <lb/>the set-up and of the Monte Carlo simulations performed <lb/>with the aim to optimize it are described elsewhere [19]. <lb/>According to these simulations the main background con-<lb/>tribution to the spectra of scattered photons (as shown in <lb/>fig. 1) is due to bremsstrahlung produced from pair pro-<lb/>duction and Compton scattering in the target. The simu-<lb/>lation of this background (cf. figs. 1 and 2) could be made <lb/>sufficiently accurate to allow the generation of pure nrf-<lb/>spectra by subtracting the simulated non-resonant contri-<lb/>bution from the experimental data. <lb/>Due to the 300 keV difference of the neutron binding <lb/>energies of <lb/> 98  Mo and <lb/> 100  Mo a subtraction of the <lb/> 100  Mo <lb/>data from the <lb/> 98  Mo data results in a pure nrf-spectrum in <lb/>the range S  n  ( <lb/> 100  Mo) to S  n  ( <lb/> 98  Mo) —under the suggestive <lb/>assumption that the non-resonant background is the same <lb/>for both isotopes (see fig. 2). From the fact that this pro-<lb/>cedure leads within errors to the same nrf-strength in this <lb/>energy bin as the Monte Carlo based subtraction, a test of <lb/>the accuracy of the latter procedure is obtained. It should <lb/>be noted here, that the subtraction explained above was <lb/>performed with the data after their complete correction <lb/>for detector response. Thanks to the high full energy effi-<lb/>ciency of the Ge-detectors used and as result of the good <lb/>Compton suppression by the BGO shields such a response <lb/>correction could be performed without introducing large <lb/>statistical uncertainties. <lb/> 4 Dipole strength in isolated narrow <lb/>resonances <lb/> In the nrf-spectra obtained from the raw data as shown in <lb/>figs. 1 and 2 many isolated resonances could be analysed <lb/>in the range from 4 MeV up to the endpoint energy of <lb/>13.2 MeV; the lower part of the spectra is discussed else-<lb/>where [21]. For the three isotopes 299, 310 and 296 reso-<lb/>nances, respectively, could be distinguished above 4 MeV; <lb/>no strong lines can be identified above the respective neu-<lb/>tron threshold. The ratios of the intensities <lb/>dI <lb/>dΩ <lb/>= <lb/> R <lb/> dσ(E) <lb/>dΩ <lb/>dE, <lb/>(5) <lb/>where the integral includes the full (narrow) resonance R, <lb/> as observed at scattering angles 90 <lb/> •  and 127 <lb/> •  , have been <lb/>compared to the values expected for a spin sequence 0-<lb/>1-0 or 0-2-0 for excitation and de-excitation. Apparently <lb/>nearly all of the transitions are due to spin 1 resonances. <lb/>They are assumed to be E1, as from a previous experimen-<lb/>tal nrf-study on <lb/> 92  Mo only 1 resonance is identified [22] <lb/>to have positive parity; its M 1-strength to the gs corre-<lb/>sponds to 0.23μ <lb/> 2 <lb/> N  : As in the neighbouring nucleus <lb/> 90  Zr a <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 3. Distributions of the transition widths as determined <lb/>from each 50 transitions starting at 4 MeV, all reduced by the <lb/>phase space factor E <lb/> 3 <lb/> γ  . The drawn lines depict Porter-Thomas <lb/>distributions. <lb/> total M 1 strength of 6.7μ <lb/> 2 <lb/> N  was found [23] to lie between <lb/>8 and 11 MeV, it is likely that a few more M 1 resonances <lb/>are also present in <lb/> 92  Mo, but in any case most of the nrf-<lb/>strength clearly is of E1 character. A similarly low M 1 <lb/>strength has been observed for <lb/> 116  Sn and <lb/> 124  Sn [25] and <lb/>proposed for N = 82 nuclei [15]. <lb/>For the well-identified resonances the reduced width <lb/>distributions are displayed for the three isotopes in fig. 3 <lb/>after a normalization to the respective average width <lb/>taken over bins containing 50 dipole resonances each, ob-<lb/>served in the range from 4 MeV up to the neutron binding <lb/>energies. The distributions are in full agreement to Porter-<lb/>Thomas distributions indicating chaotic statistics in the <lb/>ground state transition strengths. <lb/>To study as well the statistical properties of the near-<lb/>est neighbour spacings we also treat the resonances above <lb/>4 MeV in groups of 50 and determine the average spacing <lb/>in each group. The actual spacings divided by this aver-<lb/>age are shown as dots in fig. 4 in comparison to Wigner <lb/>distributions. <lb/>From comparison to the data taken at lower end-point <lb/>energy, it is obvious that above 5 MeV nearly all of the <lb/>identified transitions connect to the ground state. To ob-<lb/>tain an estimate of the possible corrections necessary to <lb/>account for the incorrect interpretation of non-gs transi-<lb/>tion energies as level energies we have performed respec-<lb/>tive Monte Carlo simulations of level sequences describing <lb/>a Porter-Thomas or a Poisson case. Only a small distor-<lb/>tion is caused, when the transition energies resulting from <lb/>these simulations are (eventually erroneously) treated as <lb/>level energies. In any case, our Mo data do closely resemble <lb/>Wigner distributions, again pointing to chaotic statistics. <lb/> Fig. 4. Next neighbour distance distributions of the isolated <lb/>narrow resonances above 4 MeV. Averages were formed over <lb/>each 50 transition energies and the ratios of distance to average <lb/>distance were collected in 7 bins. The drawn lines represent a <lb/>Wigner distribution. <lb/> 5 Level densities and fluctuating cross <lb/>sections <lb/> The high level density in combination with Porter-Thomas <lb/>fluctuations cause a large portion of the strength to appear <lb/>in many weak transitions which are likely to be missed ex-<lb/>perimentally. This is why an average level density in its <lb/>dependence on the excitation energy can only be deter-<lb/>mined from a fluctuation analysis on the basis of Porter-<lb/>Thomas statistics [18]. Similarly, the dipole strength in a <lb/>certain energy interval has to be obtained by integrating <lb/>the complete nrf-spectra —i.e. all counts in discrete reso-<lb/>nances and in the quasi-continuum in between, after sub-<lb/>traction of the non-resonant background. The accuracy <lb/>of the determination of this background can be judged <lb/>from what is presented in fig. 2 to be sufficiently high. <lb/>As obvious from the analysis of the data shown in figs. 1 <lb/>and 2, the average strength in the last MeV below S  n  is <lb/>approximately increased by at least a factor 3 when the <lb/>continuum is included. <lb/>Another important correction has to account for in-<lb/>elastic scattering, i.e. transitions branching to excited <lb/>states. Its effect can be identified from data taken at dif-<lb/>ferent endpoint energies of the bremsstrahlung spectrum. <lb/>When the <lb/> 100  Mo data taken with an endpoint energy of <lb/>8.3 MeV are compared to the data reaching up to the <lb/>threshold of 7.8 MeV, the intensity distribution originat-<lb/>ing from these extra 500 keV of bremsstrahlung can be <lb/>identified: More than 50 % of this intensity is observed as <lb/>cascades with photons in the range of 3 of 5 MeV. Ob-<lb/>viously the remaining intensity observed as gs-transitions <lb/>has to be multiplied by a factor of 2-3 to obtain the full <lb/></body>

			<body> excitation strength. To obtain an approximation for this <lb/>correction factor the assumption [27, 28] is adopted, that <lb/>below S  n  and S  p  inelastic processes (i.e. branching) can <lb/>on the average be accounted for by setting Γ  c  = 0.2 eV (for <lb/>the Zr region) in combination with the level density [29]. <lb/>A more accurate correction is to be gained from the exper-<lb/>iments at lower energy and by Monte Carlo simulations; <lb/>obviously the approximation applied as described above <lb/>cannot introduce extra structures. <lb/>This is the first time that high resolution nrf-spectra <lb/>are analyzed such that not only the isolated resonances <lb/>are included, but also the fluctuating quasi-continuum. <lb/>This is accomplished by calculating the dipole strength <lb/>function for the energy range up to S  n  (as covered in this <lb/>experiment) from the elastic component σ  γγ  of nrf: <lb/> f  1  (E) = <lb/> 3π <lb/> 2  ¯ h <lb/> 2  c <lb/> 2  E <lb/>  −1  · <lb/> Γ <lb/>Γ  0 <lb/> · <lb/> 1 <lb/> Δ <lb/> · <lb/> Δ <lb/> σ  γγ  (E  γ  ) · dE  γ  , (6) <lb/>where Δ is the interval selected around E for averaging the <lb/>widths Γ  0  and Γ and the photon energy E  γ  . The photon <lb/>absorption cross section is thus derived from the observed <lb/>elastic photon scattering cross section σ  γγ  by correcting <lb/>bin-wise for inelastic scattering (i.e. branching). This de-<lb/>termination of f  1  then allows a quantitative comparison <lb/>of nrf —and (γ, xn)— data (cf. eq. (1)), and both can be <lb/>directly combined to extract a continuous dipole strength <lb/>function. <lb/> 6 The distribution of photon strength and <lb/>pygmy resonances <lb/> The good compatibility of the nrf-strength (corrected for <lb/>branching) directly below S  n  and the (γ, xn) data directly <lb/>above encourages a search for structure in f  1  (E) derived <lb/>from the two data sets (see fig. 5). The data indicate <lb/>an enhancement of the dipole strength at ∼ 9 MeV. In <lb/> 92  Mo this possible pygmy resonance appears below and in <lb/> 100  Mo it is above S  n  ; in <lb/> 98  Mo the region directly above <lb/> S  n  = 8.6 MeV shows some irregularities. In an old tagged <lb/>photon scattering experiment on natural Zr cross section <lb/>enhancements at 9.1 and 11.6 MeV were found [27]; from <lb/>the isotope enrichment and the n-threshold values it is ar-<lb/>gued, that they should originate from <lb/> 90  Zr. Most of that <lb/>strength was shown not to be M 1 [23, 28]. The Mo data <lb/>from ELBE as well as these results have to be compared <lb/>to broad resonance-like structures seen [25] in Sn isotopes <lb/>at 6.7 and between 8.0 and 8.7 MeV. The strength as ex-<lb/>tracted from an experiment [25] on <lb/> 116  Sn an <lb/> 124  Sn clearly <lb/>stays below the extrapolation of the GDR-Lorentzian as <lb/>only narrow isolated resonances had been analyzed. Al-<lb/>though the broad structures seen in Sn by the tagged pho-<lb/>ton study [27] and in the new Ge-detector experiment [25] <lb/>appear at nearly the same energies, the strength observed <lb/>in the region of the broad pygmy structure differs by a fac-<lb/>tor of two between the two types of experiment. Obviously, <lb/>an analysis of the well-isolated peak on the basis of eq. (4) <lb/> Fig. 5. Dipole strength functions determined from the photon <lb/>scattering and the (γ, xn) data as described in the text. The <lb/>nrf data are shown in bins of 100 keV; this makes the enhance-<lb/>ment of strength in several single resonances near 6 MeV less <lb/>obvious. In the case of <lb/> 92  Mo also the (γ, p)-process has to be <lb/>accounted for; this is indicated by including a respective cross <lb/>section calculation [30] for the corresponding contribution to <lb/>be added to obtain the total strength. Due to the weakness of <lb/>quadrupole excitations the plotted f is effectively the dipole <lb/>strength function f  1. <lb/> misses much of the strength which is accounted for by fol-<lb/>lowing a procedure characterized by eq. (6), which does <lb/>not ignore the fluctuating quasi-background. The only <lb/>other isotope chain studied in this range of A, the even Ge <lb/>isotopes, show [24] no clear pygmy resonance appearing in <lb/>the discrete spectra below S  n  . The average strength func-<lb/>tion obtained from these resonances by using formula (4) <lb/>amounts to ∼ 10 <lb/> −8  MeV <lb/> −3  and clearly stays below the <lb/>extrapolated Lorentzian extracted from the (γ, xn) data. <lb/>Recent HFB-QRPA calculations [8] give good fits to <lb/>GDR data when the force Bsk-7 of Skyrme-type is used to <lb/>describe the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. Never-<lb/>theless it should be noted here, that σ(γ, n) directly above <lb/>threshold is well described only for <lb/> 94  Mo, whereas the cal-<lb/>culation is below the experimental value [20] for <lb/> 100  Mo by <lb/>a factor 4. An extension of such calculations to lower E <lb/> —including the pygmy region— seems interesting. <lb/> 7 Conclusion <lb/> The response of nuclei to dipole radiation can well be stud-<lb/>ied by photon scattering investigated at a bremsstrahlung <lb/>facility like ELBE. Using a sufficiently high endpoint en-<lb/>ergy and correcting the data for inelastic processes allows <lb/>to directly combine the dipole strength functions f  1  ob-<lb/>tained from the (γ, γ) (i.e. nrf) and the (γ, xn) data; to-<lb/>gether they span the full range from the ground state to <lb/>the GDR. A comparison of f  1  (E) to a Lorentzian extra-<lb/>polated from the GDR needs a more thorough discussion <lb/>of the spreading of the GDR than is accomplished by just <lb/>fitting near its maximum [5, 20]. Apparently, the large <lb/></body>

			<body> apparent width of the GDR in <lb/> 100  Mo may be caused by <lb/>a deformation of that nucleus; accounting for that by a <lb/>two-resonance fit would reduce the low energy tail consid-<lb/>erably. Calculations of the type presented recently [2,8,11] <lb/>may help to clarify this point, especially when the nuclear <lb/>deformation is included with sufficient accuracy. <lb/>Above ∼ 4 MeV the predicted level densities [29] in-<lb/>creasingly surpass the number of identifiable resonances <lb/>and apparently the levels of <lb/> 92  Mo, <lb/> 98  Mo and <lb/> 100  Mo show <lb/>signs of a chaotic structure: The next neighbour distance <lb/>distributions of the clearly identified peaks are Wigner <lb/>distributed and their ground-state transition widths fol-<lb/>low Porter-Thomas distributions. From these facts one ex-<lb/>pects the photon scattering excitation functions —which <lb/>in a bremsstrahlung beam are observed simultaneously <lb/>over a wide range— to show Porter-Thomas fluctuations <lb/>in case the detector resolution surpasses the average peak <lb/>distance. As this is the case for most of the Mo data dis-<lb/>cussed here, a reasonable extraction of strength informa-<lb/>tion should not ignore the fluctuating quasi-continuous <lb/>part of the cross section. <lb/>Thus f  1  (E) was determined for the three Mo isotopes <lb/>by using all scattering strength with the exception of the <lb/>nonresonantly scattered photons, whose contribution to <lb/>the spectra was calculated and subtracted. The f  1  data for <lb/>the three Mo isotopes show a clear maximum at ∼ 9 MeV <lb/>indicating the presence of a pygmy resonance, as was ob-<lb/>served at this energy also in <lb/> 90  Zr and slightly lower in <lb/>energy in Sn isotopes. The 9 MeV structure is below S  n <lb/> in <lb/> 92  Mo and clearly above S  n  in <lb/> 100  Mo; in <lb/> 98  Mo a cross <lb/>section irregularity shows up at the neutron threshold. In-<lb/>termediate structures are weakly showing up also between <lb/>6 and 7 MeV (as in <lb/> 118  Sn and <lb/> 124  Sn) and eventually also at <lb/>11 MeV (as in <lb/> 90  Zr). This may be considered an indication <lb/>for a sequence of pygmy resonances —not just one. <lb/> Dr P. Michel and the ELBE-Crew made these experiments pos-<lb/>sible with their strong commitment to deliver optimum beams. <lb/>A. Hartmann and W. Schulze provided very valuable support <lb/>during the difficult experiments. Intensive discussions with Dr <lb/>F. Becvar, Dr F. Dönau and Dr R. Wünsch are gratefully ac-<lb/>knowledged.

The <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 4  He, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reaction is the key process for the production of <lb/> 7  Be and <lb/> 8  B neutrinos in the <lb/>Sun. We have designed a new experimental setup to study this reaction with high accuracy at low energies <lb/>using two different experimental techniques. The first method consists in measuring the prompt capture <lb/>gamma-ray transitions with an ultra-low background germanium detector heavily shielded and placed at <lb/>close distance from a <lb/> 3  He windowless gas target. With another fully shielded large-volume germanium <lb/>detector we will also measure the β-decay of the <lb/> 7  Be residual nuclei. The aim of the experiment is to <lb/>reduce the error on the astrophysical factor S3,4 to 4%. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 26.20.+f Hydrostatic stellar nucleosynthesis <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The solar neutrino flux resulting from the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B, <lb/>depends on nuclear physics and astrophysics inputs [1]: <lb/> Φ(B) = Φ(B)(SSM ) · S <lb/> −0.43 <lb/> 3,3 <lb/> S <lb/> 0.84 <lb/>3,4  S <lb/> 1 <lb/>1,7  S <lb/> −1 <lb/> e7  S <lb/> −2.7 <lb/> pp <lb/> (1) <lb/> ·com <lb/> 1.4  opa <lb/> 2.6  dif <lb/> 0.34  lum <lb/> 7.2  . <lb/> The <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reaction is one of the major source <lb/>of uncertainty in determining the B solar neutrino flux <lb/>and dominates over the present observational accuracy of <lb/>7% [2].

In the first method <lb/>direct α-capture γ rays were detected, while in the second <lb/>the delayed <lb/> 7  Be β decay γ rays were counted. <lb/>The average S(0) S-factors, obtained with the two <lb/>techniques, show a discrepancy of the order of 11% (see <lb/>fig. 1). <lb/>Possible explanations for this discrepancy can be found <lb/>in the systematic errors of the two methods: for example in <lb/>the on-line γ measurement the low-energy angular distri-<lb/>bution knowledge and the beam heating effect; in the acti-<lb/>vation measurement the beam-induced reactions on beam-<lb/>stopper impurities leading to the production of <lb/> 7  Be. Re-<lb/>cently, Nara Singh et al. [4] studied the <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reac-<lb/>tion with high precision but with the activation technique <lb/>only (see fig. 1). Therefore a new high-precision measure-<lb/>ment of the <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reaction, using both techniques <lb/>at the same time, is highly desirable. <lb/>Here we report on a new measurement undergoing deep <lb/>underground at the INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica <lb/>Nucleare) Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) <lb/> 1  , <lb/>1500 m below the Gran Sasso Mountain (L&apos;Aquila, Italy), <lb/>where cosmic ray background is highly reduced by the <lb/>natural shielding of the rock. <lb/>The measurement will be performed using both the <lb/>direct γ detection and the activation techniques with the <lb/>same experimental setup at the LUNA II 400 kV facility. <lb/>The aim of the present work is to reduce the S-factor un-<lb/>certainty down to 4%. <lb/> 2 Experimental setup <lb/> The experiment will be performed using the LUNAII <lb/>400 kV accelerator. Details on the machine can be found <lb/> 1  Web resource: http://www.lngs.infn.it <lb/> in ref. [5]. Briefly, it consists of a radio frequency (RF) <lb/>ion source, a singletron electrostatic extraction-accelerator <lb/>system (embedded in a tank, which is filled with a gas mix-<lb/>ture of N  2  -CO  2  at 20 bar), a 45 <lb/> •  magnet (30 cm radius) <lb/>and a vertical steerer. The accelerator provides ion beam <lb/>of approximately 500 μA protons and 250 μA He. The ab-<lb/>solute beam energy is known with an accuracy of 0.3 keV <lb/>and the energy spread and long-term energy stability were <lb/>observed to be 100 eV and 5 eV/h. <lb/>We use an α beam in conjunction with a recirculating <lb/> 3  He windowless gas target (a schematic diagram is shown <lb/>in fig. 2). According to refs. [6,7,8,9] the deuterium and <lb/>proton beam contamination have been found less in a <lb/> 4  He <lb/>beam than in an <lb/> 3  He beam. <lb/>The beam enters the target chamber through three <lb/>apertures of high gas flow impedance and is stopped on <lb/>a beam calorimeter placed at the downstream part of the <lb/>chamber. During the experiment the <lb/> 3  He gas coming from <lb/>the target is continuously recirculated. The gas is recov-<lb/>ered from the first two pumping stages, cleaned through <lb/>a heated getter gas purifier (Monotorr from SAES GET-<lb/>TER) and fed back into the target chamber. The purity of <lb/>the gas inside the target is checked using a silicon detec-<lb/>tor that measures the scattered α-particles on the target <lb/>atoms. <lb/>The beam current is measured through a calorimeter <lb/>with constant temperature gradient. The power delivered <lb/>by the beam is calculated as the difference between heat-<lb/>ing power without and with ion beam with an accuracy <lb/>of 1%. <lb/>The target pressure is measured by a Baratron capac-<lb/>itance manometer (MKS model 127) in two different po-<lb/>sitions inside the gas target with an uncertainty of 0.25%. <lb/>Typical gas pressure inside the target chamber is 1 mbar. <lb/>Due to the high beam current the local target den-<lb/>sity along the beam path can be lower than the density <lb/></body>

The internal lead collimator, the beam power calorimeter, <lb/>the movable setup for the silicon detector and the long colli-<lb/>mator before the carbon foil (at 20 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam <lb/>direction) are shown. The HpGe detector is positioned below <lb/>the target chamber. <lb/> measured at the side of the through-the-pressure gauge. <lb/>This effect, known as beam heating effect, depends on the <lb/>power for unit length delivered by the beam on the gas <lb/>target [10]. <lb/>To avoid systematic uncertainties the target density, <lb/>together with the beam current, is measured through α-<lb/> Rutherford scattering cross section with a silicon detector <lb/>positioned inside the target chamber (see fig. 3) with an <lb/>uncertainty of 0.1%. <lb/>To optimize the detector time of life and the target <lb/>chamber geometry we have decided to use a double scat-<lb/>tering setup. The α-particles are first scattered by the gas <lb/>atoms in the target chamber and subsequently by a car-<lb/>bon foil of 15 μg/cm <lb/> 2  , put at 20 <lb/> •  in respect to the beam <lb/>direction (see fig. 3). <lb/>The effective density profile as a function of the po-<lb/>sition along the beam direction, the beam current and <lb/>target pressure will be obtained with a series of dedicated <lb/>measurements with silicon detector with an estimated ac-<lb/>curacy better than 1%. <lb/> 3 The on-line γ detection technique <lb/> The <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reaction is an α-capture reaction that <lb/>can occur through electromagnetic decay to the <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>ground state (DC→0) or to the first excited state (DC → <lb/> 429 keV) with the emission of γ&apos;s of energy E  γ  = <lb/>1586 keV + E  cm  or E  γ  = 1157 keV + E  cm  , respectively (in <lb/>the latter with the subsequent emission of the 429 keV γ). <lb/> To measure the cross section we will detect the two <lb/>primary transitions (1.2 and 1.6 MeV) using a 135% ultra <lb/>low background Canberra HpGe detector positioned un-<lb/>der the target chamber in very close geometry. Since the <lb/>energy of the primary γ-transitions is in the energy region <lb/>of the natural radioactive isotopes we will build a copper <lb/>and lead shielding around the detector of 0.3 m <lb/> 3  . Passive <lb/>shielding is particularly effective underground since the <lb/>muons flux, coming from cosmic rays that, at surface, pro-<lb/>duces secondary γ-rays in the lead shielding, is reduced by <lb/>six orders of magnitude thanks to the natural shielding of <lb/>the Gran Sasso mountain. The expected attenuation fac-<lb/>tor for the <lb/> 40  K 1.46 MeV γ is 10 <lb/> −5  –10 <lb/> −6  , according to a <lb/>GEANT4 simulation [11] where the complete geometry of <lb/>the target and of the shielding has been considered. In <lb/>order to reduce the background on the detector, low ac-<lb/>tivity materials have been used in the construction of the <lb/>target chamber, silicon detector support and calorimeter. <lb/>In particular the target chamber is made by OFC copper <lb/>and no welding materials have been used in the chamber <lb/>assembly. <lb/>According to the DC model calculations [12] the <lb/>DC→0 and DC→429 keV angular distributions are dom-<lb/>inated by E1 transitions that can occur through s-<lb/>or d-waves. Most recent angular distributions measure-<lb/>ments [13] showed a small anisotropy of these transitions, <lb/>manifesting interference effects of both partial wave con-<lb/>tributions also at the lowest measured energy (E  cm  = <lb/>148 keV). It should be noted, however, that the DC model <lb/>predictions depend sensitively on the s-and d-wave phase <lb/>shifts in the <lb/> 3  He + <lb/> 4  He elastic scattering channel, which <lb/>are known experimentally only at E  cm  ≥ 1.4 MeV. A de-<lb/>tector placed at 55 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam direction, <lb/>would become almost independent of angular distribution <lb/>anisotropy. <lb/>Therefore we have put an internal lead collimator, in-<lb/>side the target chamber (see fig. 3), designed in such a way <lb/>that the detector collects mostly the γ&apos;s emitted at 55 <lb/> •  . <lb/>At the same time, this design reduces the effective target <lb/>length seen by the detector to approximately 15 cm cor-<lb/>responding to a beam energy loss ΔE of 8 keV for 1 mbar <lb/>of <lb/> 3  He gas. The internal lead collimator has been also de-<lb/>signed to shield the detector from beam-induced γ&apos;s com-<lb/>ing from reactions occurring on the entrance collimator <lb/>and on the calorimeter cap (beam stopper). <lb/>Taking into account the angular distribution mea-<lb/>sured, and considering the extreme cases of isotropy and <lb/>full anisotropy, we have estimated that with our setup the <lb/>angular distribution systematic effect is reduced to less <lb/>than 4%. <lb/>With direct method we will explore, in the first phase <lb/>of the experiment, the energy region ΔE  cm  = 100– <lb/>170 keV. With the detection efficiency of the appara-<lb/>tus previously described and a typical α-beam current <lb/>of 200 μA the expected counting rate for the 1.6 MeV <lb/> γ will be about 100 counts/day at E  cm  = 100 keV and <lb/>2000 counts/day at E  cm  = 170 keV. <lb/> 4 The activation technique <lb/> An alternative way to measure directly the γ rays pro-<lb/>duced by the <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be reaction is to detect the γ&apos;s <lb/> from the <lb/> 7  Be electron-capture decay to the 478 keV state <lb/>in <lb/> 7  Li. Since the <lb/> 7  Be residual nuclei are produced inside <lb/>the gas target are moving in the beam direction, they <lb/>are implanted into a removable copper calorimeter cap <lb/></body>

Interaction of radiation with helium atoms and/or ions is of interest in various astrophysical <lb/>applications. The reverse reactions of fast 150 MeV/amu <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  ions with solid C targets have been studied <lb/>at the isochronous cyclotron of the RCNP in Osaka. The singly ionized helium ions resulting from capture <lb/>of the target electrons to the projectile were observed with the use of large magnetic spectrograph, Grand <lb/>Raiden, set at θ = 0 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam. The yield ratios of singly-to-doubly ionized helium <lb/>ions emerging from thin carbon foils, He <lb/> +  /He <lb/> ++  , have been measured as a function of the foil thickness. <lb/>Extrapolating the results to zero target thickness permits to determine the cross section values separately <lb/>for electron stripping from <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  ions and for electron capture to <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  ions. The radiative and non-<lb/>radiative contributions to the capture cross section were determined in a separate experiment in which <lb/>the 84 keV (C.M.) photons were observed in coincidence with the He <lb/> +  ejectiles. The results are compared <lb/>with theoretical predictions. Need for improved calculations is noted for all the three processes involved, <lb/> i.e. for the radiative and non radiative electron capture as well as for the electron stripping. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 34.70.+e Charge transfer <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The main processes occurring during the passage of ions <lb/>through matter are the electron capture from the target to <lb/>the vacant states of the projectile and the ionization (strip-<lb/>ping) of the bound electrons from the passing ion (see [1] <lb/>for a general review). Cross sections for these processes <lb/>depend sharply on the velocity of the projectile as well as <lb/>on the atomic number of the projectile and of the target. <lb/>There seems to be no satisfactory theoretical description <lb/>of the ionization process for fast projectiles. Rather crude <lb/>approximations are used, applicable in limited energy and <lb/> Z  T  , Z  P  ranges, where Z  T  , Z  P  are the atomic numbers of <lb/>the target atom and of the projectile, respectively. The <lb/>classical Bohr theory [2] for low Z  T  and not very fast ions <lb/> a  e-mail: gojska@ipj.gov.pl <lb/> predicts: <lb/> σ  ST RIP  ∝ <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/> T <lb/> Z  2 <lb/> P  v  2  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where σ  ST RIP  is the stripping cross section, v is the pro-<lb/>jectile velocity. <lb/>The ionization cross section for fast ions interacting <lb/>with multi electron target atoms requires more precise the-<lb/>ory. The quantum description of the stripping process was <lb/>given by Gillespie [3,4]: <lb/> σ  ST RIP  ∝ <lb/> I <lb/>v  2  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where I is the collision strength. A phenomenological ex-<lb/>pression for I(Z  T  ) can be found in [5]. <lb/>Two very different mechanisms contribute to the elec-<lb/>tron capture: the radiative one, in which the excess energy <lb/></body>

			<body> is carried away by a photon, and the non-radiative one, <lb/>NREC. Because of the conservation laws the latter process <lb/>can occur only for the capture of electrons bound in the <lb/>target atom. The competing radiative transfer of bound <lb/>atomic electrons is referred to as the Radiative Recombi-<lb/>nation, RR, while the capture of free electrons is called the <lb/>Radiative Electron Capture, REC. The REC process can <lb/>be considered as the time-reversed photoelectric effect on <lb/>the partly ionized projectile atom. The REC cross section, <lb/> σ  REC  , grows quickly with Z  P  and decreases rapidly with <lb/> v. For high but non-relativistic projectile energy: <lb/> σ  REC  ∝ <lb/> Z  T  Z <lb/> 4.5 <lb/> P <lb/> v  5  . <lb/> (3) <lb/>In contrast, the NREC process occurs mainly at the ve-<lb/>locity matching condition v ≈ v  e  , where v  e  is the velocity <lb/>of the captured electron, bound in the target atom. For <lb/> v  v  e  : <lb/> σ  NREC  ∝ <lb/> Z <lb/> 5 <lb/> T  Z <lb/> 5 <lb/> P <lb/> v  11  . <lb/> (4) <lb/>A simple approach to describe the non-radiative electron <lb/>capture cross section is the Oppenheimer-Brinkmann-<lb/>Kramer (OBK) theory [1]. The screening corrections are <lb/>included in [6,7], while the relativistic effects are described <lb/>in [1]. Because of the sharp dependence of electron capture <lb/>cross section on velocity as well as on Z  P  the measure-<lb/>ments for fast light ions are difficult and require very re-<lb/>fined techniques. Recent experimental information on in-<lb/>teraction of fast helium ions with various gaseous and solid <lb/>targets can be found in [8,9]. The authors have measured <lb/>the stripping and the capture cross section for <lb/> 3  He ions <lb/>with energies up to 43.4 MeV/amu. The σ  CAP  /σ  ST RIP <lb/> ratios were measured for a number of thick targets in [5]. <lb/>The present work extends this information to much higher <lb/> 3  He energy, 150 MeV/amu, for Z  T  = 6. This is the first <lb/>measurement for such high-energy light projectile. Pre-<lb/>liminary results were published in [10,11]. Similar mea-<lb/>surements for Z  T  = 79 are described in [12]. The present <lb/>results are compared with theoretical capture and strip-<lb/>ping cross sections. <lb/> 2 Experiment <lb/> 2.1 Total capture and stripping cross sections <lb/> There is a huge difference in the magnitude of stripping <lb/>and capture cross sections for a fast light ion traversing <lb/>a solid. As a result, the electron captured by the ion in <lb/>one collision is very quickly lost in the subsequent one. In <lb/>effect, the charge state of the ion reaches the equilibrium <lb/>conditions in very thin layers of the solid. In order to de-<lb/>termine the interaction cross sections the target thickness <lb/>used has to be significantly smaller than the equilibrium <lb/>thickness. This is of the order of 100 μg/cm <lb/> 2  for solid car-<lb/>bon. A method to determine the total capture as well as <lb/>the stripping cross section is to carry out an extrapolation <lb/>experiment in which the yield ratio, Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  )/Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  ), <lb/>of the singly-to-doubly ionized He ions emerging from the <lb/> Fig. 1. The measured Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  )/Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  ) yield ratio as a <lb/>function of target thickness for C target. The errors are statis-<lb/>tical only. The curve is a fit of eq. (6) to the data. <lb/> target is measured as a function of the target thickness. <lb/>For thicknesses larger than the saturation value, x  sat  , this <lb/>ratio is equal to the cross section ratio [5]: <lb/> Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  ) <lb/> Y (  3  He  ++  ) <lb/>(x &gt; x  sat  ) = <lb/> σ  CAP <lb/> σ  ST RIP <lb/> . <lb/> (5) <lb/>Extrapolating the yield ratio to zero target thickness per-<lb/>mits to separately determine the respective cross section <lb/>values. <lb/>The <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++ <lb/> beam has been accelerated to <lb/>150 MeV/amu in the AVP cyclotron at the Research <lb/>Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) in Osaka. The <lb/>experimental set-up was identical to that used to study <lb/>the ( <lb/> 3  He, t) nuclear charge exchange reactions [13]. The <lb/>singly ionized <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  ions were detected together with <lb/>tritons in the focal plane of the magnetic spectrometer <lb/>Grand Raiden, set at 0 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam. The <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  beam was fully intercepted by a Faraday cup <lb/>placed in the first dipole magnet of the spectrometer. The <lb/>intensity ratio of singly-to-doubly ionized helium ions <lb/>leaving the carbon target was measured as a function of <lb/>the target thickness (fig. 1). Carbon targets: 3, 5.6, 13, <lb/>13.1, 21, 65, 102, 2000, 3000 μg/cm <lb/> 2  thick were used. <lb/>The errors in thicknesses were estimated to be between 5 <lb/>and 10%. Two sets of data were obtained under largely <lb/>changed spectrograph settings used in the singles and <lb/>coincidence experiments. A very satisfactory matching <lb/>of these sets is observed. This builds up confidence in <lb/>the proper reduction of possible systematic errors. The <lb/>capture and stripping cross sections can be determined <lb/>by fitting the simple function to the measured yield ratio <lb/> versus target thickness: <lb/> Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  ) <lb/> Y (  3  He  ++  ) <lb/>= a [1 − exp(−bx)] , <lb/> (6) <lb/>where a = <lb/> σCAP <lb/>σST  RIP  +σCAP  ∼ <lb/> σCAP <lb/>σST  RIP <lb/> cross section ratio, <lb/> b = σ  ST RIP  + σ  CAP  ∼ σ  ST RIP  , and x denotes the target <lb/>thickness in μg/cm <lb/> 2  multiplied by the number density of <lb/>the target atoms.

The coincidence REC photon spectra. <lb/> 2.2 Coincidence experiment <lb/> The extrapolation experiment measures the total electron <lb/>capture cross section which is the sum of the non-radiative <lb/>and radiative components <lb/> σ  CAP  = σ  REC  + σ  NREC  . <lb/> (7) <lb/>The relative contributions of these components can be de-<lb/>termined in a coincidence experiment in which the He <lb/> + <lb/> ejectiles are registered in coincidence with the REC pho-<lb/>tons. Neglecting the electron binding energy in helium ion <lb/>the energy of these photons corresponds to the energy <lb/>of electrons in the centre-of-mass system of the projec-<lb/>tile. The REC photons were measured in coincidence with <lb/> 3  He <lb/> +  ions by the Ge detectors set at θ = 80 <lb/> •  and θ = 130 <lb/> • <lb/> with respect to the beam. The centre-of-mass energy is <lb/> E  REC  = 84 keV. Figure 2 shows the measured spectra. <lb/>The REC photons are strongly anisotropic [14,15]. In or-<lb/>der to correct for this effect the coincidence yields were <lb/>analysed according to the formula: <lb/> σ  REC <lb/> σ  tot <lb/> = <lb/> N (REC) <lb/>(3/2)ε sin <lb/> 2  θN (  3  He  ++  ) <lb/>(8) <lb/>where Y(REC) is the coincidence photon yield, Y ( <lb/> 3  He <lb/> ++  ) <lb/>is the beam intensity, θ is the angle between the direction <lb/>of observation and the direction of the beam and ε is the <lb/>efficiency of the photon detection. <lb/> 3 Results and discussion <lb/> The measured values for the three cross sections are: <lb/> σ  ST RIP  = (821 ± 60) kb, <lb/> σ  REC  = (64 ± 12) μb, <lb/>σ  NREC  = (47 ± 8) μb. <lb/> These values are compared below with the respective <lb/>theoretical predictions. <lb/> Fig. 3.

None of the theories used reproduces the data in a <lb/>satisfactory way; the deviation of the Gillespie approxi-<lb/>mation, though suggestive, is not very significant for this <lb/>light target. <lb/> 3.2 Non-radiative electron capture <lb/> The earlier experiments determining the total capture <lb/>cross sections for He <lb/> ++  ions have been done [8,9] in the en-<lb/>ergy range 17.3–43.3 MeV/amu.

The present value can be <lb/>compared with theoretical one calculated relativistically <lb/>for all the shells: σ  REC  = 130 μb. <lb/> The non-relativistic analytical expression of Eichler [1] <lb/>gives a lower value of 111 μb. The implicit assumption is <lb/>that the electron in the carbon target can be considered as <lb/>free and uncorrelated. The assumption seems to be plau-<lb/>sible at the high helium velocity. It remains to be seen <lb/>whether the rather large difference between the calculated <lb/>and the experimental value can be related to the difference <lb/>between the radiative recombination effect for He <lb/> ++  -C <lb/>and the REC effect for free electrons. <lb/> 4 Radiative electron capture by fast <lb/>projectiles vs. the adiabaticity parameter <lb/> The available systematics [15] of REC cross section for <lb/>projectiles ranging from light ones up to as heavy as the <lb/>hydrogen-like uranium shown in fig. 5 can be presented in <lb/>the form of a universal curve as a function of the adia-<lb/>baticity parameter: <lb/> η = <lb/> v <lb/>v  e <lb/>  2 <lb/> , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where v  e  denotes the captured electron velocity in the pro-<lb/>jectile. The earlier data, obtained mainly for very heavy <lb/>projectiles, correspond to η &lt; 10 and to σ  REC  &gt; 1 b. <lb/>The present experiment extends this picture till η = 1500 <lb/> Fig. 5. The REC electron capture cross section per target <lb/>electron measured for bare ions in collisions with light target <lb/>atoms. The results are plotted as a function of the adiabaticity <lb/>parameter and compared with the result of the Dipole Approx-<lb/>imation (DA) theory. <lb/> and to the cross section several orders of magnitude lower, <lb/> σ  REC  = (64 ± 12) μb. The theoretical value is about twice <lb/>larger. <lb/> 5 Summary and conclusions <lb/> Cross sections for the three main processes occurring for <lb/>He ions traversing solid carbon have been determined at <lb/>150 MeV/amu bombarding energy. The processes in ques-<lb/>tion are the stripping of electron from singly charged He <lb/>ions, He <lb/> +  , and the radiative and non-radiative capture of <lb/>electrons from the target to the vacant states in the He <lb/> ++ <lb/> ions. This measurement, done at the highest bombarding <lb/>energy ever used for such light ions, was feasible thanks <lb/>to the use of advanced techniques of the modern nuclear <lb/>physics. The results significantly extend the systematics <lb/>of cross section versus energy data for all the three pro-<lb/>cesses and permit to test the theoretical predictions in a <lb/>sensitive region. Analysis of this systematics results in the <lb/>following statements: <lb/>– There is no theory available to satisfactorily describe <lb/>the energy dependence of the stripping cross section. <lb/>– The non-radiative electron capture from carbon to <lb/>He <lb/> ++  ions is more closely described by the relatively <lb/>simple second order Oppenheimer-Brinkmann-Kramer ap-<lb/>proximation than by the more sophisticated eikonal the-<lb/>ory. The latter seems to fail at high projectile velocities. <lb/>– The measured cross section for radiative transfer of <lb/>the bound electron from the carbon target to the helium <lb/>projectile is factor of two smaller than that calculated un-<lb/>der the assumption of the REC process i.e. of the free <lb/></body>

This is the first and the only measurement <lb/>for radiative process, be it the Radiative Recombination <lb/>or the Radiative Electron Capture, for such a light pro-<lb/>jectile at high adiabaticity parameter. Naively, the two <lb/>processes should be practically identical at high energies. <lb/>There might, however, be some constraints due to, e.g., <lb/> the angular momentum coupling, which change the ra-<lb/>diative recombination probability in comparison with the <lb/>probability of free electron capture.

Angular distributions and the neutron-proton branching ratio of the mirror reactions <lb/> 2  H(d, p) <lb/> 3  H <lb/>and <lb/> 2  H(d, n) <lb/> 3  He have been investigated using different self-implanted deuterized metallic targets at pro-<lb/>jectile energies between 5 and 60 keV. Whereas the experimental results obtained for the transition metals <lb/>Zr, Pd, Ta and also Al do not differ from those known from gas-target experiments, an enhancement of <lb/>the angular anisotropy in the neutron channel and an attenuation of the neutron-proton branching ratio <lb/>have been observed for the (earth)alkaline metals Li, Sr and Na at deuteron energies below 20 keV. Ex-<lb/>perimental results are discussed with consideration of the special problems arising from the properties of <lb/>these chemically very reactive target materials. A first theoretical effort explaining simultaneously both <lb/>n/p asymmetry effects based on an induced polarization of the reacting deuterons within the crystal lattice <lb/>is presented. <lb/> PACS. 24.70.+s Polarization phenomena in reactions – 25.45.Hi Transfer reactions – 26.20.+f Hydrostatic <lb/>stellar nucleosynthesis – 89.30.Jj Nuclear fusion power <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The d+d reactions have been investigated for decades be-<lb/>cause of their simplicity, fundamental importance and pos-<lb/>sible application in energy generation technology (e.g., <lb/>see the compilation [1]). Two of the three exit chan-<lb/>nels <lb/> 2  H(d, p) <lb/> 3  H and <lb/> 2  H(d, n) <lb/> 3  He generating high ener-<lb/>getic particles are mediated by the strong interaction <lb/>with a branching ratio of about 1 below 50 keV while <lb/>the third one <lb/> 2  H(d, γ) <lb/> 4  He is an electromagnetic transi-<lb/>tion suppressed by &gt; 10 <lb/> 7  . Close to the reaction threshold <lb/>there are two 1 <lb/> −  resonances in the compound nucleus <lb/> 4  He. <lb/>They can be excited by deuterons with an orbital angular <lb/>momentum of 1. For this reason the extraordinary strong <lb/>anisotropy of the angular distribution of the ejectiles even <lb/>at the lowest energies can be observed. These facts are well <lb/>known mostly from experiments on gas and polyethylene <lb/>targets. <lb/>There is multiple evidence that the physical environ-<lb/>ment where the nucleus is embedded can influence nuclear <lb/>interactions, e.g. this is employed in nuclear condensed <lb/>matter physics. Also in astrophysics the prolongation of <lb/>the life period of <lb/> 7  Be in the stellar plasma plays an impor-<lb/>tant role in the solar model, e.g. [2] and references therein. <lb/> a  e-mail: huke@physik.tu-berlin.de <lb/> In order to investigate the environmental impact on nu-<lb/>clear reactions, we experiment with the d+d reactions in <lb/>metallic environments. We have already found a strongly <lb/>enhanced electron screening effect leading to a gross in-<lb/>crease of the effective cross section by abatement of the <lb/>Coulomb barrier due to the metal electrons [3,4] which <lb/>was later reconfirmed [5]. Angular distributions and rela-<lb/>tive intensities of the proton and neutron channels inves-<lb/>tigated for d+d reactions taking place in Al, Zr, Pd and <lb/>Ta targets were, however, in agreement with the results of <lb/>gas-target experiments. Here we present new results ob-<lb/>tained for Sr, Li and Na targets giving a first evidence for <lb/>an alteration of the neutron-proton branching ratio and <lb/>the angular distributions. The experiment was published <lb/>in [6,7] and now a first theoretical explanation for this <lb/>surprising observation can be presented [8,9]. <lb/> 2 Experimental results <lb/> The experiment has been carried out at an electrostatic <lb/>cascade accelerator at beam energies below 60 keV main-<lb/>tained by a highly stabilized power supply.

The targets were pure <lb/>metal disks becoming self-implanted deuterium targets <lb/>under the deuteron irradiation. Four Si-detectors with an <lb/>active surface diameter of 1 cm at a distance of 10 cm and <lb/>the laboratory angles of 90 <lb/> •  , 110 <lb/> •  , 130 <lb/> •  and 150 <lb/> •  were <lb/>used for the detection of all charged particles, p, t, <lb/> 3  He, of <lb/>the reactions <lb/> 2  H(d, p)t and <lb/> 2  H(d, n) <lb/> 3  He [4]. The detectors <lb/>needed to be shielded from the backscattered deuterons in <lb/>order to prevent a congestion of them and the data acqui-<lb/>sition system. Therefore grounded Al foils of thicknesses <lb/>from 120–150 μg/cm <lb/> 2  were placed in front of the detectors <lb/>insulated from them. The thickness is sufficient in order <lb/>to stop backscattered deuterons up to 60 keV. The solid <lb/>angles surveyed by the detectors were determined with a <lb/>radioactive α source. <lb/>The low-energy part of some representative spectra <lb/>from the 90 <lb/> •  detector is depicted in fig. 2 magnifying the <lb/>two lines of the recoil nuclei <lb/> 3  He and t. The integral count-<lb/>ing number of the spectra are normalized to unity in order <lb/>to make them comparable. The energies above the peaks <lb/>are the kinetic energies of the ejectiles in the laboratory <lb/>system. They drop for increasing projectile energies, which <lb/>is especially significant for the back angle positions. The <lb/>gray filled spectra are from Ta targets, while the black <lb/>and gray step lines are for Sr and Li and Na, respectively. <lb/>The two plots compare the form of the spectral lines at a <lb/>low projectile energy of 8 keV to a high energy of 30 keV. <lb/>At 8 keV the t-line of Ta is well separated while the <lb/> 3  He-<lb/>line sits on an exponential background. The background is <lb/>subtracted by fitting an exponential function to the lowest <lb/>energy part and then by extrapolating it to the high en-<lb/>ergies. The spectral lines for Sr are already broader with <lb/>an enhanced low-energy tail leading to an overlap of both <lb/>lines. This effect becomes even stronger for Li and Na. At <lb/>30 keV the Ta lines are broader but the tails of the Sr, <lb/>Li and Na lines are much more distinctive. The overlap <lb/>of the two lines is even higher.

			<body> hydride. If the hydration precedes not in a thermal equi-<lb/>librium and relatively slowly, the material cannot com-<lb/>pensate the tension of the recrystallization process and <lb/>bursts. Since deuteron implantation is far off the thermal <lb/>equilibrium, embrittlement is a hardly avoidable concomi-<lb/>tant phenomenon for reactive metals. How embrittlement <lb/>effectuates the tails is elucidated with the sketch in fig. 2. <lb/>Assuming the projectile travels through the target along <lb/>a path covering many empty regions, the energy loss be-<lb/>comes smaller and consequently the nuclear reactions oc-<lb/>cur deeper below the target surface than in the case of <lb/>compact materials. Therefore the ejectiles that in turn can <lb/>travel through more compact target regions loose more en-<lb/>ergy additionally contributing to the low-energy tail of the <lb/>particle spectrum. The increase of the tail with the pro-<lb/>jectile energy arises from the simultaneous increase in the <lb/>range of the projectiles. The material dependence can be <lb/>explained, too. Ta is almost a noble metal with low reac-<lb/>tivity but nonetheless able to chemically bind hydrogen <lb/>to high amounts. It just stretches its lattice but does not <lb/>recrystallize like the highly reactive metals of the groups I <lb/>and II of the periodic system. So there is no embrittlement <lb/>and hardly a tail visible. On the other hand, the effects of <lb/>embrittlement and the tail increase from Sr over Li to Na <lb/>with decreasing electron negativity. The symptoms were <lb/>even visible, e.g. dust particles crumbled from a strontium <lb/>target, the thickness of a sodium target grew considerably. <lb/>The low-energy tail formation complicates the integration <lb/>of the spectral lines till infeasibility in the case of Na. The <lb/> 3  He-line sits on the tail of the t-line. All efforts to de-<lb/>scribe and extrapolate the tail of the t-line to the lower <lb/>energies analytically failed, since the form of the lines is <lb/>dependent on the nucleus species, ejectile and projectile <lb/>energy. Uncertainties in the integral of the spectral lines <lb/>are taken into account in the errors additionally to the <lb/>counting statistic. Consequently they are the dominating <lb/>error source. If in doubt, counts were attributed to the <lb/> 3  He-line only, gaining a conservative estimate of the n/p <lb/>branching ratio at least. Fortunately, the tails are small <lb/>at the low projectile energies where the asymmetry in the <lb/>branching ratios becomes observable. The problems of in-<lb/>tegrating the overlapping spectral lines cannot be circum-<lb/>vented by the use of detector telescopes for particle iden-<lb/>tification. The ΔE-detector of the usual semiconductor <lb/>detector telescopes would already absorb the recoil nuclei. <lb/>Another problem affecting the results comes from a <lb/>property of RF ion sources inherent to their design. The <lb/>extraction of the ions from the plasma within the source <lb/>is done with an electric field which is formed by an extrac-<lb/>tion channel made from pure aluminium inside a ceramic <lb/>cylinder. This extraction channel presets the direction, fo-<lb/>cus and flux profile of the beam prior to the lenses in <lb/>front of the acceleration line. Because of its contact to <lb/>the plasma and its small dimensions in order to throttle <lb/>the gas loss it is a wear out commodity. The burn down <lb/>proceeds not necessarily symmetrical relative to the geo-<lb/>metrical axis. Thus, the beam direction and flux profile <lb/>can gradually change during the wear out causing a shift <lb/>of the flux distribution within the beam spot on the target. <lb/> 1.6×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 1.8×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.0×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.2×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.4×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.6×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> dN/dω <lb/> 3 <lb/> He <lb/> a  2 /a 0 = 0.570±0.017 <lb/> 0 <lb/>3 0 <lb/>60 <lb/>90 <lb/>120 <lb/>150 <lb/>180 <lb/> ϑ <lb/> 1.7×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 1.8×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 1.9×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.0×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.1×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.2×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.3×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.4×10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> dN/dω <lb/> p <lb/>t <lb/> a  2 /a 0 = 0.326±0.014 <lb/> Fig. 3.

Here a close detector geometry <lb/>was set up facing a large beam spot, thus aggravating the <lb/>problem. On the other hand a set-up in far geometry with <lb/>a small beam spot would suffer from low counting rates. <lb/>Neglecting l ≥ 2 contributions, the angular distribu-<lb/>tion can be described as follows: <lb/>dσ <lb/>dω <lb/>(ϑ) = A  0  + A  2  cos <lb/> 2  ϑ . <lb/> (1) <lb/>Because of the identical bosons in the entrance channel the <lb/>angular distribution is symmetric around 90 <lb/> •  . ϑ and ω are <lb/>the polar angle and the solid angle in the CM system, re-<lb/>spectively.

The upper part displays the anisotropy from the de-<lb/>tection of the p and <lb/> 3  He ejectiles. The lower part shows the <lb/>branching ratio of the two mirror reactions. <lb/> The results are listed in table 1 and plotted in fig. 4. <lb/>The branching ratios and angular distributions for Ta <lb/>agree with the results of the gas target experiment [11] <lb/>and due to the much higher target nuclei density the data <lb/>set has a notedly higher precision and extends to lower en-<lb/>ergies ([4], fig. 1). This agreement applies likewise to Al, <lb/>Zr and Pd. Not so for Sr and Li. While for p there are no <lb/>peculiarities, for <lb/> 3  He the anisotropy raises at lower ener-<lb/>gies. Simultaneously, the n branch is suppressed. This is <lb/>better cognizable in the rescaled fig. 5 for Sr. The results <lb/>for protons and tritons are concordant. The low quality <lb/>of the Li points results from the ambiguity of the inte-<lb/>gration of the spectral lines with large low-energy tails. <lb/>For the same reason, the spectra obtained for Na could <lb/>not be analyzed quantitatively, though the spectra indi-<lb/>cate a strong suppression of the neutron-proton ratio at <lb/>low energies, too. Because of the relative alteration in the <lb/>counting numbers of the detectors from the burn down of <lb/>the extraction channel the angular anisotropies obtain a <lb/>gradually increasing positive offset corresponding to the <lb/>sequence of the measurement campaign. Starting with Ta <lb/>the value of the offset increased for Sr, Li, Zr and finally <lb/>culminated at Al. Therefore the anisotropy data for Sr in <lb/>table 1 and figs. 4, 5 was renormalized to the ones of Ta. <lb/>Note: the anisotropy values in fig. 3 are the original ones. <lb/>These corrections, however, hardly affect the branching <lb/></body>

From the anisotropy presented in fig. 5 it can be <lb/>seen that there are significant deviations from the smooth <lb/>progression of the curve at 40 and 45 keV. They originate <lb/>from suboptimal beam focus adjustment with accordingly <lb/>beam flux shifts because of necessary beam current re-<lb/>ductions at higher deuteron energies. The deviations oc-<lb/>cur likewise for protons and <lb/> 3  He. Altogether an additional <lb/>systematic error is introduced. For details refer to [6]. <lb/> 3 Theoretical considerations and discussion <lb/> Multiple scattering of the ejectiles in the thick target could <lb/>possibly redirect leaving particles depending on the nu-<lb/>cleus species and thereby change the detection rate. In or-<lb/>der to test this, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed <lb/>tracing the path of the reaction ejectiles [12]. The tar-<lb/>get bulk is assumed to be amorphous where the reaction <lb/>occurs at a randomly selected depth weighted with the <lb/>stopping power function and the cross section. The ejec-<lb/>tile on his part is emitted in a direction determined by <lb/>a random function regarding the angle dependent cross <lb/>section. On its way it suffers hits on scattering centers <lb/>and loses meanwhile energy to electrons. The ejectiles hit-<lb/>ting onto the detectors were counted and set in relation <lb/>to the same sort of ejectiles which would have reached <lb/>the detector if there were no subsequent scattering. The <lb/>differences in the target materials are manifested merely <lb/>in the stopping power coefficients. The calculations were <lb/>performed for Li, Sr and Ta. Only for high energies above <lb/>20 keV at the backward angle 130 <lb/> •  a significant alteration <lb/>can be noticed causing a slight additional anisotropy of <lb/>the <lb/> 3  He ejectiles. This can be understood from the re-<lb/>action kinematics predicting an enlarged energy drop for <lb/>massive ejectiles at backward angles which is further am-<lb/>plified by the higher energy loss and stronger scattering <lb/>of the double charged <lb/> 3  He nuclei altogether preferring the <lb/>130 <lb/> •  -detector across from the 45 <lb/> •  tilted target. This be-<lb/>haviour is a direct consequence of the concrete detector <lb/>target geometry and strongly dependent on it. This also <lb/>means that there is no modification at the low energies. So <lb/>multiple scattering can be excluded from the possible triv-<lb/>ial reasons for the material dependent n/p branching ratio. <lb/>Moreover, the long low energy tail of the spectral lines was <lb/>not obtained by the simulation which is not unexpected <lb/>because of its origin from the embrittlement. Instead, the <lb/>simulation disclosed that the tiny tail at the high energy <lb/>side of the spectral lines, only visible with high spectral <lb/>resolution, is from multiple scattering. <lb/>The embrittlement cannot be responsible for the ob-<lb/>served anomalous asymmetry in the branching ratios, <lb/>since the effects of embrittlement like tail formation rise <lb/>with the projectile energy in contradiction to the devia-<lb/>tions in the branching ratio. This is also valid for con-<lb/>ceivable weird surface textures. Such was reconfirmed on <lb/>a Ta target with an artificial blemished surface showing <lb/>no differences to the usual results for Ta. Furthermore, <lb/>anisotropic symmetries in crystal structures cause effects <lb/>like optical activity and piezo and pyro electricity [13]. So <lb/>this could be a conceivable reason for the experimental <lb/>observations. Enantiomorphy is a necessary condition for <lb/>such effects. However, the point groups belonging to LiD, <lb/>SrD  2  and NaD do not allow for this. Transient magnetic <lb/>fields can cause an alignment of the projectile nucleus rel-<lb/>ative to the interior magnetic field of ferromagnetic target <lb/>materials [14,15]. Despite unfulfilled requisites, this still <lb/>not fully understood phenomenon could be considered. An <lb/>experiment on a ferromagnetic Fe target showed no effect. <lb/>From the theoretical point of view the cross sections <lb/>for the mirror reactions <lb/> 2  H(d, p) <lb/> 3  H and <lb/> 2  H(d, n) <lb/> 3  He at <lb/>deuteron energies below 100 keV can be described with 16 <lb/>collision matrix elements, corresponding to S,P,D-waves in <lb/>the entrance channel. The matrix elements for incoming <lb/>D-waves cannot be omitted as frequently asserted since <lb/>they are mandatory to describe the angular anisotropy <lb/>down to the lowest energies. The values of the matrix el-<lb/>ements are relatively well known and were obtained by <lb/>fitting experimental cross sections, vector and tensor an-<lb/>alyzing powers measured in gas target experiments [16, <lb/>17]. The differential cross section for both reactions can be <lb/>presented by a coherent superposition of all sixteen matrix <lb/>elements [8] (dashed line in fig. 5) and agrees with our re-<lb/>sults obtained for Al, Zr, Pd and Ta. In the case of Sr (also <lb/>for Li) a polarization of the deuterons in the crystal lattice <lb/>had to be assumed. A suppression of the channel spin S = <lb/>0 (spins of the deuterons are anti-parallel) and allowing <lb/></body>

			<body> the other channels with spins S = 1, 2 to be undisturbed <lb/>permits to describe simultaneously the enhancement of <lb/>the angular anisotropy of the <lb/> 2  H(d, n) <lb/> 3  He reaction and the <lb/>decrease of the n/p branching ratio at very low energies <lb/>down to 0.83. The results of corresponding calculations <lb/>are presented in fig. 5 as full lines. Here we have assumed <lb/>that the deuteron polarization takes place gradually be-<lb/>low the Fermi energy (for Sr about 25 keV), reaching its <lb/>maximum value already below 10 keV. A strong quenching <lb/>of the neutron channel might also be explained by differ-<lb/>ent screening energies for relative angular momentum L = <lb/>0, 1. Such was also tested and proved to be in contradic-<lb/>tion to the experimental results. The full calculations will <lb/>be subject of a forthcoming publication, also refer to [8]. <lb/> 4 Conclusion <lb/> We presented a first experimental evidence for an alter-<lb/>ation of the branching ratios in the d+d fusion reac-<lb/>tions obtained in an accelerator experiment which can <lb/>be theoretically explained by polarization of the reacting <lb/>deuterons in the crystal lattice. Several other conceivable <lb/>but rather trivial causes could be excluded. Albeit the <lb/>deeper reason for the deuteron polarization on its part <lb/>is still unknown. A distinctiveness of the (earth)alkaline <lb/>metals is the formation of an ionic bond to hydrogen, <lb/>which might be a starting point for a possible explana-<lb/>tion based on the spin-spin interaction mediated by elec-<lb/>trons. The conditions in high vacuum make up for metal <lb/>oxides and hydroxides in the chemical reactive targets [18] <lb/>which could also be responsible for the observed effects by <lb/>means of their special electron configuration and would be <lb/>as such non-trivial and interesting, too. <lb/>So with the spin polarization is here another new way <lb/>how the environmental electron configuration can influ-<lb/>ence immediate nuclear processes. The dense bound and <lb/>free electrons in the metal can abate the Coulomb bar-<lb/>rier in a dynamic process prior to the reaction generating <lb/>a gross enhancement of the cross section which can still <lb/>not be described by theory to this extent [19]. Both are <lb/>dynamic processes. Static processes with respect to the <lb/>electrons like alterations in the β decay of light nuclei are <lb/>easier comprehensible. The screening from the electrons <lb/>in the molecule CH  3  T causes a shift in the spectral dis-<lb/>tribution of the β particles [20]. The removal of the two <lb/>1s electrons of <lb/> 7  Be in the hot stellar plasma significantly <lb/>increases the half-time for the decay by electron capture. <lb/>Since the 1s electrons contribute by far the most to the <lb/>electron density in the nucleus the modification of the or-<lb/>bitals of outer shell valence electrons would have only little <lb/>influence on the decay parameters. <lb/>Our findings also provide a first independent sup-<lb/>port for the claim in cold fusion that requires a heavily <lb/>alteration of the d+d reaction channels in contradiction <lb/>to the results obtained for gas targets. Thus making it, <lb/>together with the enhanced electron screening in met-<lb/>als [19], more credible although further efforts are nec-<lb/>essary. An experiment with more sophisticated particle <lb/>detection techniques is in progress in order to refine the <lb/>data. <lb/></body>

We measured the <lb/> 7  Be half-life in palladium, tungsten, zirconium and tantalum <lb/>metals, in order to investigate the influence of the quasi-free electrons in metals on the probability of <lb/>electron capture. The <lb/> 7  Be samples were obtained implanting a 4.85 MeV pure radioactive <lb/> 7  Be ion beam. <lb/>The <lb/> 7  Be half-life was determined measuring the 478 keV gamma decay following the electron capture <lb/>by means of HPGe detectors. In order to reduce systematic errors, we planned to perform independent <lb/>measurements in three different laboratories: Naples (Italy), Bochum (Germany) and Debrecen (Hungary). <lb/>On the basis of the first results, we do not find a <lb/> 7  Be half-life change within the experimental errors of 0.4%. <lb/> PACS. 21.10.Tg Lifetimes – 23.40.-s β decay; double β decay; electron and muon capture – 27.20.+n <lb/>6 ≤ A ≤ 19 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> In the stellar environment, <lb/> 7  Be is produced by <lb/> 3  He(α, γ) <lb/> 7  Be and destroyed by <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B, which is re-<lb/>sponsible for the high-energy solar neutrino flux, and, in <lb/>competition, by <lb/> 7  Be decay. <lb/> 7  Be decays to <lb/> 7  Li via electron <lb/>capture, populating either the <lb/> 7  Li ground state or, in 10% <lb/>of the cases, the first excited state, which decays to the <lb/>ground state emitting a 478 keV gamma ray. <lb/>The half-life of the nuclei such as <lb/> 7  Be which decays by <lb/>electron capture depends on the electron density at the <lb/>nucleus. Therefore, the decay probability of these nuclei <lb/>in stellar plasma environment differs from their terrestrial <lb/>values. Starting from 1949 [1], many experiments were <lb/>done in order to measure variations of the <lb/> 7  Be half-life <lb/>depending on the host chemical environment. Although <lb/>the half-life changes are in most cases lower than 0.2% [2], <lb/>some authors found larger variations [3,4,5]. <lb/>Recently, it was discovered that the electron screening <lb/>in d(d, p)t reaction for deuterated metals is much higher <lb/>than the screening measured in d(d, p)t using deuterium <lb/>gas target [6]. This feature has been explained by the <lb/>Debye plasma model applied to the quasi-free electrons <lb/>in metals: these electrons form an electron cloud around <lb/> a  e-mail: limata@na-infn.it <lb/> the nucleus with a Debye radius which is about a factor <lb/>10 smaller than the atomic radius [7]. According to this <lb/>picture, <lb/> 7  Be nuclei implanted in metallic host materials <lb/>may probe a higher electron density, that would provide a <lb/>test case for the calculations of the <lb/> 7  Be decay in the solar <lb/>plasma. <lb/>We implanted <lb/> 7  Be in different metallic targets and <lb/>we measured the half-life of an electron capture in or-<lb/>der to highlight a detectable half-life variation depending <lb/>on the different quasi-free electronic density. The choice <lb/>of the host materials was based on the measurements <lb/>of the electron screening potential for d(d, p)t in deuter-<lb/>ated metals [6]: palladium, tungsten and tantalum metals <lb/>show a large screening potential, whereas for zirconium <lb/>the screening effect is smaller. <lb/>In previous experiments, with the exception of [8], sec-<lb/>ondary <lb/> 7  Be beams have been used and therefore both <lb/>the projectile and the <lb/> 7  Be recoil have been implanted <lb/>at roughly the same depth. As a consequence, the elec-<lb/>tron distribution around <lb/> 7  Be nuclei may be altered due to <lb/>a) the chemical contamination of the beam; b) the lattice <lb/>damage induced by the high implantation currents. In this <lb/>experiment, we use a different approach, i.e. a pure <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>beam is implanted in host materials in order to virtually <lb/>reduce to zero the implantation damage and avoid changes <lb/>of the sample stoichiometry.

Shortly, <lb/> 7  Be is produced via <lb/> 7  Li(p, n) <lb/> 7  Be using a 11.7 MeV proton <lb/>beam with a current intensity of 20 μA, delivered by the <lb/>ATOMKI Cyclotron of Debrecen (Hungary). <lb/> 7  Be is then <lb/>extracted from the metallic Li target by means of radio-<lb/>chemical methods [12] at the isotopic laboratory of the <lb/>Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Germany). The activity is col-<lb/>lected into a cathode of the sputtering ion source which is <lb/>used to produce a <lb/> 7  BeO <lb/> −  beam. This molecular ion beam <lb/>is injected in the accelerator and the emerging <lb/> 7  Be <lb/> 2+  beam <lb/>is selected as a <lb/> 7  Be <lb/> 4+  beam, after passing a thin C foil. <lb/>This procedure suppresses the Li contamination in the <lb/>beam and allows to obtain a high-purity <lb/> 7  Be beam. The <lb/>beam intensity was about 7 ppA. A pair of scanning mag-<lb/>nets provided a uniform implantation. The scheme of the <lb/>experimental setup is shown in fig. 1. <lb/>The implanted metallic materials are Pd, W, Zr, Ta <lb/>with activities ranging from 3.6 to 36 kBq. The kinetic <lb/>beam energy E  lab  = 4.85 MeV provided about 3–4 μm ion <lb/>stopping range (table 1), which is deeper than the lay-<lb/>ers where one expects surface contaminations and oxida-<lb/>tion of the metal. The <lb/> 7  Be half-life of the implanted sam-<lb/>ples was independently measured in the laboratories of <lb/>Bochum, Debrecen and Naples. The 478 keV gamma emis-<lb/>sion was detected with HPGe detectors. A <lb/> 60  Co source was <lb/>included in all measuring setups (except for the W Naples <lb/> Table 2.

The a), <lb/>b), c) errors can be avoided if the half-life value is eval-<lb/>uated by normalising the <lb/> 7  Be counts to another indepen-<lb/>dent source.

A direct comparison between <lb/>Naples and Debrecen data is possible for Pd and W met-<lb/>als. Unfortunately, for the W metal, the precision of the <lb/>Naples measurement is not sufficient, since no additional <lb/>reference source was available in the experimental setup. <lb/>The results have to be compared to the <lb/> 7  Be half-life <lb/>adopted value [2] of 53.22 ± 0.06 days. Although the data <lb/>analysis has to be finalized for all the implanted metals, on <lb/>the basis of the first Debrecen and Naples data above, we <lb/>do not find <lb/> 7  Be half-life change within the experimental <lb/>errors (0.3-0.4%). <lb/>This result is compatible at a 2σ level with the pre-<lb/>dictions of the Debye model applied to the free electrons <lb/>in metals, provided the following additional assumptions <lb/>are made: a) the contribution of the free electrons capture <lb/>is negligible; b) the Debye screening does not affect the <lb/>electron steady wave functions of <lb/> 7  Be atoms. In this case, <lb/>in fact, the <lb/> 7  Be screening potential U  D  due to the free <lb/>electrons is U  D  = −1 × 4 × U  d+d  , where 4 is Beryllium <lb/>atomic number and U  d+d  is the electron screening value <lb/>measured in d(d, p)t reaction in metallic environments. <lb/>Between the metals considered, the highest U  d+d  value <lb/>is 800 eV for Palladium [6], which gives U  D  = −3.2 keV. <lb/>Since the electron capture process scales with the energy <lb/>squared, the reduction factor of the decay probability is <lb/>[(862 − 3.2)/862] <lb/> 2  = 0.992, i.e. 0.8%, which correspond to <lb/>a longer half-life( <lb/> 1  ). <lb/> 1  The energy release of the <lb/> 7  Be electron capture decay is <lb/>862 keV. <lb/> Finally, our results seem not to confirm the findings <lb/>of [5] where a correlation between the screening and the <lb/> 7  Be half-life was observed having opposite sign respect to <lb/>the predictions of the Debye model. However, a realistic <lb/>model of the electron capture decay of <lb/> 7  Be in metallic <lb/>environment should be developed to compare these ex-<lb/>perimental results with the data of the electron screening <lb/>in metals. <lb/> This work was supported by OTKA T042733, F043408, <lb/>D048283, T049245.

The elastic scattering cross section of <lb/> 106  Cd(α, α) <lb/> 106  Cd has been measured with high accuracy <lb/>at energies of Ec.m. ≈ 15.5, 17, and 19 MeV. The optical potential for the system <lb/> 106  Cd ⊗α has been <lb/>derived at energies above and below the Coulomb barrier. Predictions for the <lb/> 106  Cd(α, γ) <lb/> 110  Sn capture <lb/>cross section at astrophysically relevant energies are presented and compared to the experimental data <lb/>measured recently. <lb/> PACS. 24.10.Ht Optical and diffraction models – 25.55.-e <lb/> 3  H-, <lb/> 3  He-, and <lb/> 4  He-induced reactions – 25.55.Ci <lb/>Elastic and inelastic scattering – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae and other explosive envi-<lb/>ronments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The nucleosynthesis of nuclei above the iron peak pro-<lb/>ceeds mainly by neutron capture in the s-and r-process. <lb/>However, there are 35 other, stable, proton-rich, the so-<lb/>called p-nuclei, which cannot be produced via neutron <lb/>capture reactions [1]. The production of the p-nuclei pro-<lb/>ceeds mainly via photon-induced reactions in the O/Ne <lb/>layers of type-II supernovae. The s and r seed nuclei are <lb/>disintegrated by (γ, n), (γ, p) and (γ, α) reactions in the <lb/>high photon flux of the explosion. <lb/>Calculations for the p-process involve more than 1000 <lb/>nuclei in a network that requires more than 10000 reac-<lb/>tion rates [2]. Almost none of these reaction rates has been <lb/>measured and the calculations rely completely on the sta-<lb/>tistical model. One of the input parameters in statistical <lb/>model calculations to determine (γ, α) reaction rates is <lb/>the alpha-nucleus optical potentials. However, the uncer-<lb/>tainties shown by the alpha-nucleus potentials at astro-<lb/>physically relevant energies are large [3,4]. Experimental <lb/>informations are therefore required to reduce the uncer-<lb/>tainties in the calculation of (γ, α) reaction rates. <lb/>In principle, the alpha-nucleus potentials can be deter-<lb/>mined from alpha elastic scattering experiments. The fea-<lb/> a  e-mail: ggkiss@atomki.hu <lb/> b  Present address: NSCL Michigan State University, 1 Cy-<lb/>clotron Lab East Lansing MI 48824-1321 USA. <lb/> sibility of such a measurement is, however, limited in gen-<lb/>eral because the experimentally determined cross section <lb/>at energies below the Coulomb barrier shows only a small <lb/>deviation from the Rutherford cross section and the results <lb/>have ambiguities. In recent years, however, alpha-nucleus <lb/>potential parameters of <lb/> 144  Sm, <lb/> 92  Mo, <lb/> 112,114  Sn have been <lb/>successfully derived at ATOMKI [4,5,6]. A new exper-<lb/>iment on <lb/> 106  Cd, the most proton-rich stable isotope of <lb/>Cd, helps to better understand the behavior of the alpha-<lb/>nucleus optical potential as a function of the mass number <lb/>and energy. <lb/>The choice of the measured energies at about 15.5, <lb/>17 and 19 MeV has the following reason. The Gamow-<lb/>window for (γ, α) reactions at T  9  ≈ 2–3 is in the range <lb/>of E  γ  ≈ 5–10 MeV corresponding to 4–9 MeV for the in-<lb/>verse <lb/> 106  Cd(α, γ) <lb/> 110  Sn reaction. Recently the (α, γ) cap-<lb/>ture cross section on <lb/> 106  Cd has been measured in the up-<lb/>per part and above the Gamow-window [7,8]. The exper-<lb/>imental determination of the nuclear part of the optical <lb/>potential at this astrophysical energy, however, is impos-<lb/>sible, because of the dominating Coulomb interaction. The <lb/>height of the Coulomb barrier is about 18.2 MeV. The aim <lb/>of the present work is to determine the optical potential <lb/>at the lowest possible energies, moreover, at several en-<lb/>ergies above and below the Coulomb barrier to be able <lb/>to extrapolate the optical potential parameters to the as-<lb/>trophysically relevant energy region. We finally compare <lb/>the measured (α, γ) cross section of <lb/> 106  Cd with the pre-<lb/></body>

Complete angular dis-<lb/>tributions between 20 <lb/> •  and 170 <lb/> •  were measured in steps <lb/>of 1 <lb/> •  (20 <lb/> • <lb/> ≤ ϑ ≤ 100 <lb/> •  ), 1.5 <lb/> •  (100 <lb/> • <lb/> ≤ ϑ ≤ 140 <lb/> •  ) and <lb/>2 <lb/> •  (140 <lb/> • <lb/> ≤ ϑ ≤ 170 <lb/> •  ) at alpha energies of E  Lab  = <lb/>16.13 MeV, 17.65 MeV and 19.61 MeV. The beam inten-<lb/>sity was 150 pnA. A typical spectrum of <lb/> 106  Cd(α, α) <lb/> 106  Cd <lb/>reaction is shown in fig. 1. <lb/>The highly enriched (≈ 97%) cadmium targets were <lb/>produced by evaporation at the target laboratory at <lb/>ATOMKI. A thin carbon foil (≈ 20 μg/cm <lb/> 2  ) was used <lb/>as backing. The thickness of the target was roughly <lb/>250 μg/cm <lb/> 2  . The target was mounted on a remotely con-<lb/>trolled target ladder in the centre of the scattering cham-<lb/>ber. The stability of the target was monitored during the <lb/>whole experiment to avoid systematic uncertainties from <lb/>changes in the target. <lb/>An aperture of 2 × 6 mm was mounted on the target <lb/>holder to check the beam position and size of the beam <lb/>spot before and after every change of beam energy or cur-<lb/>rent. We optimized the beam until not more than 1% of <lb/>the total beam current could be measured on this aper-<lb/>ture. As a result, the horizontal size of the beam spot was <lb/>smaller than 2 mm during the whole experiment which is <lb/>very important for the precise determination of the scat-<lb/>tering angle. <lb/>Taking into account the Q values of the open reac-<lb/>tion channels, particle ID was not necessary. For the mea-<lb/>surement of the angular distribution we used four sur-<lb/>face barrier detectors with an active area of 50 mm <lb/> 2  . The <lb/>detectors were mounted on upper and lower turntables, <lb/>the angular distance between two detectors on the same <lb/> Fig. 2.

The solid angles of the detector pairs <lb/>were ΔΩ = 1.63×10 <lb/> −4  and ΔΩ = 1.55×10 <lb/> −4  . The ratios <lb/>of the solid angles of the different detectors were checked <lb/>by measurements at overlapping angles with an accuracy <lb/>of better than 1%. <lb/>Additionally, two detectors were mounted at the wall <lb/>of the scattering chamber at a fixed angle of ϑ = ±15 <lb/> • <lb/> with respect to the beam direction. These detectors were <lb/>used as monitor detectors during the experiment to nor-<lb/>malize the measured angular distribution and to deter-<lb/>mine the precise position of the beam spot. The solid angle <lb/>of these detectors was ΔΩ = 8.1 × 10 <lb/> −6  . <lb/>The signals from the detectors were amplified using <lb/>charge-sensitive preamplifiers, which were mounted di-<lb/>rectly at the scattering chamber. The output signal was <lb/>led to the main amplifier and fed into an analog-digital <lb/>converter. For the coincidence measurements (see below) <lb/>the bipolar signals of the main amplifiers were fed into <lb/>timing single-channel analyzers, and the unipolar outputs <lb/>were gated using linear gate stretchers. <lb/>The angular calibration of the setup is of crucial im-<lb/>portance for the precision of the scattering experiments at <lb/>energies close to the Coulomb barrier because the Ruther-<lb/>ford cross section depends very sensitively on the angle. <lb/>Small uncertainties of 0.1 <lb/> •  in the determination of the <lb/>scattering angle lead to uncertainties of 2% in the cross <lb/>section at forward angles. To determine the scattering an-<lb/>gle precisely, we measured kinematic coincidences between <lb/>elastically scattered alpha-particles and the corresponding <lb/> 12  C recoil nuclei using a pure Carbon foil as target. One <lb/>detector was placed at ϑ = 80 <lb/> •  and the signals from the <lb/>elastically scattered alpha particles on <lb/> 12  C were selected <lb/>as gates for signals from another detector which moved <lb/>around the expected <lb/> 12  C recoil angle ϑ = 40.2 <lb/> •  , fig. 2. <lb/>shows the relative yield of <lb/> 12  C recoil nuclei in coincidence <lb/>with elastically scattered alpha particles as a function of <lb/>the <lb/> 12  C recoil angle.

However the statis-<lb/>tical uncertainties of each data point changes only from <lb/> ≤ 0.3% (forward angles) to about 1%–2% (backward an-<lb/>gles). The experimental cross section normalized to the <lb/>Rutherford cross section is shown in fig. 3. <lb/> 3 Optical potential parameters <lb/> In order to determine the alpha nucleus potential of <lb/> 106  Cd, <lb/>we have performed our analysis in the framework of the <lb/>Optical Model (OM). The optical potential takes the form <lb/> U (r) = V  C  (r) + V (r) + iW (r), <lb/>(2) <lb/>where V  C  (r) is the Coulomb potential, V (r) and W (r) <lb/>are the real and imaginary parts of the nuclear potential, <lb/>respectively. The description of V (r) is done using the <lb/>double-folding procedure, in which both nuclei interact <lb/>via an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction in the well-<lb/>established DDM3Y parametrization [9,10]. The real part <lb/>of the nuclear potential is based on this double-folding <lb/>potential V  f  (r), in which two small corrections in strength <lb/>(λ) and width (ω ≈ 1.0) have been applied: <lb/> V (r) = λV  f  (r/ω). <lb/>(3) <lb/>The parameter ω is introduced to modify the width of <lb/>the potential. Through this rearrangement, it is possible <lb/>to correct the deviations between the proton and neutron <lb/>density distributions within the nucleus. For stable light <lb/>nuclei with Z = N there is no need for such a parame-<lb/>ter. In case of medium or heavy nuclei with a neutron-<lb/>to-proton ratio of N/Z ≥ 1.2 it is necessary to take this <lb/>correction into consideration. <lb/>The strength parameter λ has been described by a lin-<lb/>ear form: <lb/> λ = <lb/> a <lb/>  *  + b <lb/>  *  E  c.m. <lb/> J  R,0 <lb/> . <lb/> (4) <lb/>The coefficients a <lb/>  *  and b <lb/>  *  are listed in table 1. The vol-<lb/>ume integral of the potential J  R,0  for λ = 1.0 and the cor-<lb/>responding ω are also listed. The weak energy dependence <lb/>of the volume integral through b <lb/>  *  reduces the uncertain-<lb/>ties of the extrapolation to the astrophysically relevant <lb/>energy region. <lb/>For a comparison of different potentials we use the <lb/>integral parameters such as the volume integral per inter-<lb/>acting nucleon pair J  R  and the root-mean-square (rms) <lb/>radius r  rms,R  , which are given by <lb/> J  R  = <lb/>1 <lb/> A  p  A  T <lb/> V (r) d <lb/> 3  r, <lb/> (5) <lb/> r  rms,R  = <lb/> V (r)r  2  d  3  r <lb/> V (r) d  3  r <lb/>, <lb/> (6) <lb/>for the real part of the potential V (r) and the corre-<lb/>sponding equations hold for W (r). The Coulomb poten-<lb/>tial is taken in the usual form of a homogeneously charged <lb/>sphere. In the imaginary part of the nuclear potential we <lb/>have tested different parameterizations. It turned out that <lb/>the best fit to our experimental data is given by the combi-<lb/>nation of volume (V ) and surface (S) Wood-Saxons poten-<lb/>tials.

This work was performed to understand the structure of neutron-rich fission fragments around <lb/>the 130 mass region. A thin <lb/> 235  U target was bombarded by a <lb/> 14  N beam with 10 MeV/A from the Separated <lb/>Sector Cyclotron at the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa. <lb/>The main goal was to detect and identify fission fragments and to obtain their mass distribution by <lb/>using solar cell detectors in the AFRODITE (African Omnipurpose Detector for Innovative Techniques <lb/>and Experiments) spectrometer. The X-rays emitted from fission fragments were detected by LEP (Low <lb/>Energy Photon) detectors and γ-rays emitted from excited states of the fission fragments were detected <lb/>by CLOVER detectors in the spectrometer. <lb/> PACS. 25.70.Jj Fusion and fusion-fission reactions – 21.10.Gv Mass and neutron distributions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The studies for heavy-ion–induced fusion-fission reaction <lb/>have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years <lb/>due to the expansion of the knowledge and understanding <lb/>of the structure of neutron-rich fission fragments. There <lb/>are two mechanisms of the fusion-fission reaction when <lb/>bombarding a heavy target with a high-energy beam well <lb/>above the Coulomb barrier: low-energetic fission and deep-<lb/>inelastic processes. Asymmetric fission as a result of the <lb/>former mechanism is a process dominated by shell effects <lb/>and the heavy fragment is a neutron-excessive nucleus <lb/>having approximately 50 protons and 82 neutrons. Since <lb/>the beam energy is well above the Coulomb barrier, a few <lb/>nucleons are evaporated and the mass of the fragments is <lb/>shifted towards the line of stability. Thus, the interplay be-<lb/>tween the target-projectile combination and the variation <lb/>of the projectile energy provides a possibility of moving <lb/>the centroid of the fragment mass distribution through-<lb/>out the (N, Z)-plane and accessing nuclei which cannot <lb/>be produced in spontaneous fission or through symmetric <lb/> a  e-mail: yalcinm@istanbul.edu.tr <lb/> fission [1,2]. Therefore, other reaction mechanisms needed <lb/>to be utilized in these cases. <lb/>In a previous study, Yu et al. [3] investigated the re-<lb/>action <lb/> 12  C + <lb/> 238  U at 20 MeV/A and demonstrated that <lb/>with the increase of the beam energy deep-inelastic pro-<lb/>cesses begin to compete with fusion-fission reactions for <lb/>which, the asymmetric fission channel is open when using <lb/>actinide targets. <lb/>Recently, in the low-energy proton-induced fission of <lb/>actinides, it has also been demonstrated that there ex-<lb/>ist at least two independent deformation paths for fission <lb/>process; one leads to a symmetrically elongated scission <lb/>configuration, and the other leads to a compact scission <lb/>configuration with reflection asymmetry [4]. <lb/>In this work, we present an experiment to investigate <lb/>nuclei around the 130 mass region utilizing the <lb/> 14  N + <lb/> 235  U <lb/>reaction at 10 MeV/A. In order to obtain the fragment <lb/>mass distribution directly from the reaction given above, <lb/>a thin target and solar cell array have to be used. This <lb/>arrangement will also give opportunity to correct Doppler <lb/>shift due to the fission fragments decaying in flight as well <lb/>as direct fragment identification. <lb/></body>

The Channel-Energy-Mass dependency obtained for <lb/>the H3 and A2 solar cell detectors. <lb/> 2 Experiment <lb/> We used <lb/> 14  N + <lb/> 235  U reactions in order to produce fis-<lb/>sion fragments. The 140 MeV <lb/> 14  N beam for these experi-<lb/>ments was delivered by the Separated Sector Cyclotron <lb/>at the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sci-<lb/>ences, Cape Town, South Africa. The <lb/> 14  N projectile was <lb/>chosen in order to somewhat enhance the production of <lb/>odd-Z isotopes. The γ decay and the X-rays after the re-<lb/>action were detected by the AFRODITE spectrometer, <lb/>which consisted of seven Compton-suppressed CLOVER <lb/>detectors and eight large-area LEPs detectors. This spec-<lb/>trometer is described in detail in ref. [5]. <lb/>The reaction chamber had Mylar windows. All this <lb/>allowed to have a detection limit for the X-rays as low <lb/>as 8–10 keV. A thin 500 μg/cm <lb/> 2  target of <lb/> 235  U was used <lb/>in the experiment. Solar cell detectors, positioned at for-<lb/>ward angles, were operated together with the AFRODITE <lb/>spectrometer, which allowed measurement of fragment–γ– <lb/>X-ray coincidences. <lb/> 3 Results <lb/> The response of solar cell detectors have to be calculated <lb/>since the energy of incoming fragments from the fission <lb/>is not exactly proportional to the deposited energy due <lb/>to the Pulse Height Defects (PHD).

The calibration and unfolding results <lb/>plotted in figs. 2 and 3 are based on average neutron mul-<lb/>tiplicity for each fragment [8] and the well-known <lb/> 252  Cf <lb/>mass distribution [9,10,11]. <lb/>As can be easily seen, there are two prominent humps <lb/>determined as <lb/> A  L  = 108–109 amu and A  H  = 144 amu in the <lb/>mass distribution corresponding to the light and heavy fis-<lb/>sion fragments, respectively, are in good agreement with <lb/>a literature values A  L  = 108.9 ± 0.5 amu and A  H  = <lb/>143.1 ± 0.5 within the experimental accuracy [9]. <lb/>Solar cell detectors calibrated using the method given <lb/>above were then used for detecting fission fragments from <lb/>the <lb/> 14  N + <lb/> 235  U fusion-fission reaction.

Figure 4 <lb/>shows the fission Q-value dependency on the M  H  /M  L  ra-<lb/>tio for <lb/> 245  Es assuming that the number of pre-fission neu-<lb/>tron evaporation ν  pre  = 3.69. The average number of neu-<lb/>trons evaporated ν  pre  and ν  post  were taken from ref. [15]. <lb/>The pulse height spectra of the fission fragments are <lb/>shown in figs. 5a, 6a and the unfolded mass distributions of <lb/>the fission products are shown in figs. 5b, 6b. The unfolded <lb/>mass distributions were obtained with the same method <lb/>mentioned above using the iterative processing algorithm <lb/>of Houry [7]. <lb/> 4 Conclusion <lb/> The mass distributions obtained from solar cell detectors <lb/>for <lb/> 14  N + <lb/> 235  U reactions in figs. 5b and 6b were subjected <lb/>to further investigation by fitting the whole mass distri-<lb/>butions to sum of three Gaussian functions. The masses <lb/>of fragments formed in the area are in the range of 75– <lb/>180 amu. The thick solid curve in figs. 5b and 6b is the <lb/>results of the fit assuming that there are one dominant <lb/>symmetric and two asymmetric components. These Gaus-<lb/>sians are centered around 124 amu with σ = 57 (for the A2 <lb/>solar cell) and σ = 64 (for the H3 solar cell) for the sym-<lb/>metric and around 87 amu and 162 amu with σ = 13 for <lb/>both the asymmetric components. In figs. 5b and 6b, the <lb/>dark grey Gaussian-like distributions can be attributed to <lb/>the shell closures, which have been observed in ref. [16] <lb/>and ref. [17]. <lb/>It can be concluded that the asymmetric channel could <lb/>be opened, hence the neutron-rich nuclei heavier than <lb/>those produced in the spontaneous fission could be ob-<lb/>tained [18,19,20]. It could also be concluded that by em-<lb/>ploying solar cells in the array improves the mass selectiv-<lb/>ity by direct fragment identification. <lb/> This work was supported by the Research Fund of the Uni-<lb/>versity of Istanbul, Project numbers UP-12/040199 and UP-<lb/>8/270598. <lb/></body>

Owing to the presence of the Coulomb barrier at astrophysically relevant kinetic energies it is <lb/>very difficult, or sometimes impossible, to measure astrophysical reaction rates in the laboratory. That <lb/>is why different indirect techniques are being used along with direct measurements. Here we address two <lb/>important indirect techniques, the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) and the Trojan Horse (TH) <lb/>methods. We discuss the application of the ANC technique for calculation of the astrophysical processes <lb/>in the presence of subthreshold bound states, in particular, two different mechanisms are discussed: direct <lb/>capture to the subthreshold state and capture to the low-lying bound states through the subthreshold state, <lb/>which plays the role of the subthreshold resonance. The ANC technique can also be used to determine <lb/>the interference sign of the resonant and nonresonant (direct) terms of the reaction amplitude. The TH <lb/>method is unique indirect technique allowing one to measure astrophysical rearrangement reactions down to <lb/>astrophysically relevant energies.

The presence of the Coulomb barrier for collid-<lb/>ing charged nuclei makes nuclear reaction cross sections at <lb/>astrophysical energies so small that their direct measure-<lb/>ments in laboratories is very difficult, or even impossible. <lb/>That is why direct measurements are being done at higher <lb/>energies and then extrapolated down to the Gamow en-<lb/>ergy. Such an extrapolation procedure can cause an ad-<lb/>ditional uncertainty. Also for nuclear reactions studied in <lb/>laboratory, the electron clouds surrounding the interact-<lb/>ing nuclei lead to a screened cross section which is larger <lb/>than the &quot; bare &quot; nucleus one (see [2,3,4,5] and references <lb/> a  e-mail: akram@comp.tamu.edu <lb/> therein). The enhancement factor is determined by the <lb/>electron screening potential which is a model dependent <lb/>quantity and its value in the laboratory is different from <lb/>the one present in the stellar environment. There are four <lb/>often used indirect techniques: the asymptotic normaliza-<lb/>tion coefficient (ANC) method [6], Coulomb breakup pro-<lb/>cesses [7,8], Trojan Horse (TH) [9,5] and the surrogate <lb/>reactions method (see [10] and references therein). In this <lb/>work we address only two indirect techniques, the ANC <lb/>and TH methods. <lb/> 2 ANC method <lb/> The ANC method has been suggested in [11,12] and can <lb/>be used to determine the astrophysical factors for pe-<lb/>ripheral radiative capture processes. The method can be <lb/>applied for analysis of direct radiative capture processes <lb/></body>

			<body> leading to final loosely bound states. Due to small binding <lb/>energies and strong Coulomb barrier, the direct capture <lb/>reactions are peripheral. In previous papers [11,12,13] it <lb/>has been pointed out that the overall normalization of the <lb/>cross section for a direct radiative capture reaction at low <lb/>binding energy is entirely defined by the ANC of the fi-<lb/>nal bound state wave function into the two-body channel <lb/>corresponding to the colliding particles. The ANC tech-<lb/>nique turns out to be very productive for analysis of the <lb/>astrophysical processes in the presence of the subthresh-<lb/>old state [14]. Here we address some applications of the <lb/>ANC method in the presence of the subthreshold state. <lb/>We also demonstrate how ANC technique can be used <lb/>to determine the interference sign of the direct and reso-<lb/>nant amplitudes for some important astrophysical radia-<lb/>tive capture reactions. <lb/> 2.1 Definition of the ANC <lb/> We present first some useful equations for the ANC. Let <lb/>us consider a virtual decay of nucleus c into two nuclei <lb/> a and b. First we introduce the overlap function I of the <lb/>bound state wave functions of particles c, a, and b [15]: <lb/> I <lb/> c <lb/> ab  (r) = ϕ  a  (ζ  a  ) ϕ  b  (ζ  b  )|ϕ  c  (ζ  a  , ζ  b  ; r) <lb/> = <lb/> lcm  lc  jcmj  c <lb/> i <lb/> lc <lb/> J  a  M  a  j  c  m  jc  |J  c  M  c  <lb/>× ×J  b  M  b  l  c  m  lc  |j  c  m  jc  Y  lcm  lc  (ˆ r) I <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  (r). <lb/>(1) <lb/>Here ϕ  i  , ζ  i  , J  i  and M  i  are the bound state wave func-<lb/>tion, a set of internal coordinates including spin-isospin <lb/>variables, spin and spin projection for nucleus i. Also r is <lb/>the relative coordinate of the centers of mass of nuclei a <lb/> and b, ˆ r = r/r, j  c  , m  jc  are the total angular momentum <lb/>of particle b and its projection in the nucleus c = (ab), <lb/> l  c  , m  lc  are the orbital angular momentum of the relative <lb/>motion of particles a and b in the bound state c = (ab) <lb/>and its projection, j  1  m  1  j  2  m  2  |j  3  m  3  is a Clebsch-Gordan <lb/>coefficient, Y  lcmc  (ˆ r) is a spherical harmonic, and I <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  (r) <lb/>is the radial overlap function which includes the antisym-<lb/>metrization factor due to identical nucleons. The summa-<lb/>tion over l  c  and j  c  is carried out over the values allowed by <lb/>angular momentum and parity conservation in the virtual <lb/>process c → a + b. The asymptotic normalization coeffi-<lb/>cient C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  defining the amplitude of the tail of the radial <lb/>overlap function I <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  (r) is given by [15] <lb/> I <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  (r) <lb/> r&gt;RN <lb/> −→ C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc <lb/> W  −ηc,lc+1/2  (2κ  ab  r) <lb/>r <lb/>, <lb/> (2) <lb/>where R  N  is the nuclear interaction radius between a and <lb/> b, W  −ηc,lc+1/2  (2κ  ab  r) is the Whittaker function describing <lb/>the asymptotic behavior of the bound state wave function <lb/>of two charged particles, κ = <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 μ  ab  ε  c  is the wave num-<lb/>ber of the bound state c = (ab), μ  ab  is the reduced mass <lb/>of particles a and b, ε  c  is the binding energy of the bound <lb/>state (ab) and η  c  = Z  a  Z  b  e <lb/> 2  μ  ab  /κ is the Coulomb param-<lb/>eter of the bound state (ab), Z  i  e is the charge of particle <lb/> i. We use the system of units such that ¯ h = c = 1. There <lb/>is another definition of the ANC, the most model inde-<lb/>pendent one. The elastic a + b scattering amplitude in the <lb/>channel (l  c  , j  c  ) has a pole in the momentum plane [14] <lb/> M  lcjc  (k) = <lb/> S  lcjc  − 1 <lb/>2 i k <lb/> k→kp <lb/> −→ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 i k  p <lb/> W  lcjc <lb/> k − k  p <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>corresponding to the bound state c = (ab) for k  p  = i κ and <lb/>to the resonance for k  p  = k  R  , where k  R  = k  0  − i k  I  is the <lb/>resonance location in the momentum plane. Here, S  lcjc  is <lb/>the elastic matrix element of the S-matrix. The residue in <lb/>the pole W  lcjc  is <lb/> W  lcjc  = −(−1) <lb/> lc  ie <lb/> iπηc  (C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  ) <lb/> 2  , k  p  = i κ, <lb/> (4) <lb/> W  lcjc  = −(−1) <lb/> lc  i (C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc(R)  ) <lb/> 2  , k  p  = k  R  . <lb/> (5) <lb/>For narrow resonances, k  I  k  0  , <lb/>(C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc(R)  ) <lb/> 2  = (−1) <lb/> lc  μ  ab <lb/> k  1 <lb/> e <lb/> π η0  e <lb/> 2i δ  lc jc  (k0)  Γ  lcjc  . <lb/> (6) <lb/>Here η  0  is the Coulomb parameter for the resonance at <lb/>momentum k  0  , δ  lcjc  (k  0  ) is the potential (non-resonant) <lb/>scattering phase shift taken at the momentum k  0  . Thus <lb/>the residue in the bound state or resonance pole is ex-<lb/>pressed in terms of the ANC and for the resonance the <lb/>ANC can be expressed in terms of the partial resonance <lb/>width [14]. Note that eq. (3) holds only for k in the closest <lb/>vicinity of the pole. For elastic scattering at positive en-<lb/>ergies in the presence of the Coulomb barrier, the elastic <lb/>scattering amplitude with the bound state pole behaves <lb/>(in the R-matrix approach) as <lb/> M  lcjc  (k) <lb/> k→0 <lb/> −→= − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 k <lb/>e <lb/> −2i(φ  lc  −σ  lc  ) <lb/> Γ  c <lb/> E + ε  c  + i Γ  c  /2 <lb/>, (7) <lb/>where <lb/> Γ  c  = 2 P  lc  (E) γ <lb/> 2 <lb/> c  . <lb/> (8) <lb/>Here P  lc  (E) is the penetrability through the Coulomb-<lb/>centrifugal barrier, φ  lc  is the solid sphere scattering phase <lb/>shift in the partial wave l  c  and σ  lc  = <lb/> lc <lb/> n=1 <lb/> tan <lb/> −1  ( <lb/> ηc <lb/>n  ), r  0  is <lb/>the channel radius, γ <lb/> 2 <lb/> c  is the effective (observable) reduced <lb/>width: <lb/> γ <lb/> 2 <lb/> c  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2μ  ab <lb/> W  −ηc,lc+1/2  (2κr  0  ) <lb/> r  0 <lb/> (C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc(r)  ) <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>Thus at positive energies, E → +0 due to the presence <lb/>of the Coulomb-centrifugal barrier the elastic scattering <lb/>amplitude behaves as the resonant scattering amplitude <lb/>with the resonance width expressed in terms of the ANC. <lb/>At positive energies the elastic scattering cross section in <lb/>the presence of the bound state and the barrier behaves <lb/>as the high-energy tail of the resonance located at energy <lb/> E = −ε  c  . That what is called the &quot; subthreshold &quot; reso-<lb/>nance. However, it is not a resonance because the real res-<lb/>onance is located at complex energies on the second energy <lb/></body>

			<body> sheet, while the subthreshold resonance is just the bound <lb/>state located on the first energy sheet at negative energy, <lb/>corresponding to the bound state. At negative energies <lb/>(positive imaginary momenta) eq. (9) reduces to eq. (3). <lb/>Definitions of the ANC dictate the experimental methods <lb/>of its determination. The ANC can be determined from <lb/>peripheral transfer reactions which are dominated by the <lb/>tail of the overlap function. Equation (3) offers another <lb/>possibility to determine the ANC, namely, by extrapolat-<lb/>ing the elastic scattering amplitude (or equivalently the <lb/>phase shift) to the bound state pole [16]. <lb/> 2.2 ANC and astrophysical processes <lb/> i) For peripheral direct radiative capture reaction a + b → <lb/> c + γ to the final state l  c  j  c  proceeding through the EL <lb/> transition, the cross section is <lb/> σ ∼ |I <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  (r)|r <lb/> L <lb/> |ψ  kili  (r)| <lb/> 2 <lb/> ≈ |C <lb/> c <lb/>ablcjc  | <lb/> 2 <lb/> || <lb/> W  −ηc,lc+1/2  (2κ  ab  r) <lb/>r <lb/> |r <lb/> L <lb/> |ψ  kili  (r)| <lb/> 2  . (10) <lb/>Here L is the multipolarity of transition, ψ  ki li  (r) is the ini-<lb/>tial a+b scattering wave function with the relative momen-<lb/>tum k  i  in the partial wave l  i  . Thus the ANC determines <lb/>the overall normalization of the direct radiative capture <lb/>cross sections. <lb/>ii) The elastic scattering amplitude (7) describes the <lb/>elastic scattering through the intermediate bound state <lb/> c = (ab). Assume that it is an excited state. Then, when <lb/>the excited bound state is formed it can decay into the <lb/>ground state by emitting a photon. In this case we have <lb/>the radiative capture process which is called the capture <lb/>to the ground state through the subthreshold resonance. <lb/>The amplitude of this process is given by <lb/> M  lcjc  (k) <lb/> k→0 <lb/> −→= − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 k <lb/>e <lb/> −2i(φ  lc  −σ  lc  ) <lb/> Γ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> c <lb/> Γ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> γ <lb/> E + ε  c  + i Γ  c  /2 <lb/>. (11) <lb/>Here |Γ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> γ  | <lb/> 2  gives the radiative width for the transition <lb/>from the excited bound state → ground state. Thus in the <lb/>presence of an excited bound state close to threshold, two <lb/>different radiative capture processes can occur: direct cap-<lb/>ture to this excited bound state or capture to the low-lying <lb/>bound states through this subthreshold bound state (cap-<lb/>ture through the subthreshold resonance). In what follows <lb/>we present some astrophysical reactions in the presence of <lb/>the subthreshold state. <lb/> 2.3 ANC for <lb/> 14 N + p → <lb/> 15 O and the astrophysical <lb/>S-factor for <lb/> 14 N(p, γ) <lb/> 15 O <lb/> The <lb/> 14  N + p → <lb/> 15  O + γ reaction is a notorious example of <lb/>an important astrophysical reaction where the subthresh-<lb/>old state plays a dominant role.

The ANC for the subthreshold <lb/>state E  s  = −504 keV also determines the partial proton <lb/>width of the subthreshold resonance.

Both the <lb/>channel radiative width and nonresonant amplitude are <lb/>normalized in terms of the ANC, C  J  f  Il  f  , which defines <lb/>the amplitude of the tail of the bound state wave function <lb/>of nucleus c projected onto the two-body channel a+b with <lb/>the quantum numbers J  f  , I, l  f  . Such a normalization is <lb/>physically transparent: both quantities describe periph-<lb/>eral processes and, hence, contain the tail of the overlap <lb/>function of the bound wave functions of c, a and b, whose <lb/>normalization is given by the corresponding ANC. Note <lb/>that in the R-matrix method the internal nonresonant <lb/>amplitude is included into the resonance term. Also, in <lb/>the conventional R-matrix approach the channel radiative <lb/>width and nonresonant amplitude are normalized in terms <lb/>of the reduced width amplitude, which is not directly ob-<lb/>servable and depends on the channel radius. However, it <lb/>is more convenient to express the normalization of the <lb/>nonresonant amplitude in terms of the ANC that can be <lb/>measured independently [14]. Then only the radial ma-<lb/>trix element depends on the channel radius. As we can see <lb/>from eqs. (21) and (22) the relative phase of the channel <lb/>radiative width and the nonresonant amplitude is fixed <lb/>because only the ANC has unknown phase factor. Thus <lb/>by measuring the ANC for the bound state we are able <lb/>to fix the absolute normalization of the channel radiative <lb/>width and nonresonant amplitude simultaneously. <lb/> 2.5 Interference of the resonant and nonresonant <lb/>amplitudes for the <lb/> 11 C(p, γ) <lb/> 12 N astrophysical radiative <lb/>capture reaction <lb/> The evolution of very low-metallicity, massive stars de-<lb/>pends critically on the amount of CNO nuclei that they <lb/>produce.

The contribu-<lb/>tions from the second resonance and interference effects <lb/>were estimated using the R-matrix approach with the <lb/>measured asymptotic normalization coefficient and the <lb/>latest value for the radiative width of the second reso-<lb/>nance [23]. The ANC gives useful information not only <lb/>about the overall normalization of the direct capture am-<lb/>plitude, but also about the radiative width of the reso-<lb/>nances. According to eqs. (20), the channel part of the ra-<lb/>diative width may be determined from the ANC. Since the <lb/>channel part is complex, [Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> ch  = λ+iτ , while the <lb/>internal part of the radiative width amplitude is real, i.e. <lb/> [Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> int  = ν, the total radiative width is given by <lb/> Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E) = (λ + ν) <lb/> 2  + τ <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (24) <lb/>The relative phase of λ and ν is, a priori, unknown, so <lb/>these real parts may interfere either constructively or <lb/>destructively. Hence, τ <lb/> 2  always provides a lower limit for <lb/>the radiative width and additional stronger limits may be <lb/>obtained if assumptions are made about the interference <lb/>between the two real contributions. For constructive <lb/>interference of the real parts, the channel contribution <lb/>gives a stronger lower limit. In the case of destructive <lb/>interference, if |λ| &gt; |ν|, the channel contribution gives an <lb/>upper limit for the radiative width. These limits depend <lb/>on only one model parameter, the channel radius. <lb/>Recently, a measurement at RIKEN [23] found the <lb/>gamma width to be 13.0 ± 0.5 meV. Using the measured <lb/>ANC we find that for a channel radius of r  0  = 5.0 fm, <lb/> Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E  R  )  ch  = 54 meV. Taking into account the experi-<lb/>mental value of the total radiative width, one can find the <lb/>internal contribution from <lb/> Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E  R  ) = <lb/> Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E  R  ) <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> ch  + Γ  γJ  f  Ji  (E  R  ) <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> int <lb/> 2  . (25) <lb/>There are two solutions, 15 and 112 meV. Assuming that <lb/>the second value is too high [24], we conclude that the <lb/>internal part of the radiative width is 15 meV, and de-<lb/>structive interference between the real parts of the channel <lb/>and internal contributions gives the experimental value, <lb/>13 meV. In this case, the channel contribution alone rep-<lb/>resents an upper limit for the radiative width, while the <lb/>square of the imaginary part of the channel contribution, <lb/>1.8 meV, gives a lower limit. The relative phase between <lb/>the direct capture amplitude and the channel contribution <lb/>to the radiative width of the second resonance is fixed <lb/>in the R-matrix approach. Therefore, when the channel <lb/>contribution to the radiative width dominates, the sign of <lb/>the interference effects may be determined unambiguously. <lb/>For <lb/> 11  C(p, γ) <lb/> 12  N, we find that the nonresonant and res-<lb/>onant capture amplitudes interfere constructively below <lb/>the resonance and destructively above it. It has important <lb/>consequences on the reaction rates for <lb/> 12  N production. <lb/>In particular, the reaction sequence <lb/> 7  Be(α, γ) <lb/> 11  C(p, γ) <lb/> 12  N <lb/></body>

			<body> will provide a means to produce CNO nuclei, while bypass-<lb/>ing the 3 α reaction, in lower-density environments than <lb/>previously anticipated [25]. <lb/> 2.6 Interference of the resonant and nonresonant <lb/>amplitudes for the <lb/> 13 N(p, γ) <lb/> 14 O astrophysical radiative <lb/>capture <lb/> 13  N(p, γ) <lb/> 14  O is one of the key reactions which trigger the <lb/>onset of the hot CNO cycle. This transition occurs when <lb/>the proton capture rate on <lb/> 13  N is faster, due to increas-<lb/>ing stellar temperature (≥ 10 <lb/> 8  K), than the <lb/> 13  N β-decay <lb/> rate. The rate of this reaction is dominated by the reso-<lb/>nant capture to the ground state of <lb/> 14  O through the first <lb/>excited state of (E  R  = 0.528 MeV). However, through con-<lb/>structive interference, direct capture below the resonance <lb/>makes a non-negligible contribution to the reaction rate. <lb/>We have determined this direct contribution by measur-<lb/>ing the asymptotic normalization coefficient for <lb/> 13  N+p → <lb/> 14  O (0.0 MeV). This ANC has been determined from the <lb/>peripheral reaction <lb/> 14  N( <lb/> 13  N, <lb/> 14  O) <lb/> 13  C [26]. The radiative <lb/>capture cross section was estimated using an R-matrix <lb/> approach with the measured asymptotic normalization co-<lb/>efficient and the latest resonance parameters. What is not <lb/>known is the sign of the interference term between the res-<lb/>onant and nonresonant components of the radiative cap-<lb/>ture amplitudes. As we have mentioned it is possible to <lb/>sometimes infer the sign of the interference to be used in <lb/> R-matrix calculations of the radiative capture cross sec-<lb/>tion if the ANC is known even in the absence of direct <lb/>experimental data. Such is the case for the reaction be-<lb/>ing considered here. At energies below the resonance, the <lb/>channel part, which depends on the ANC, has the same <lb/>sign as the nonresonant amplitude leading to the con-<lb/>structive interference of these two terms. From eqs. (21) <lb/>and (20) we find [Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E  R  )] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> ch <lb/> = 0.90 + i 0.02 eV <lb/> 1/2  and <lb/>the channel radiative width |[Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E  R  )] <lb/> ch <lb/> | = 0.81 eV at <lb/>the resonance energy and the channel radius r  0  = 5 fm. <lb/>The total resonance radiative width is |[Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)]|| = <lb/> |[Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> int  + [Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> ch <lb/> | <lb/> 2 <lb/> . Thus there are two pos-<lb/>sible solutions for the internal part, a large negative value <lb/>[Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> int(1) <lb/> = −2.73 eV <lb/> 1/2  and a small positive value <lb/>[Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)] <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> int(2) <lb/> = 0.93 eV <lb/> 1/2  . The first solution leads to <lb/>the destructive interference with the non-resonant compo-<lb/>nent at energies below the resonance, but it yields a high <lb/>internal radiative width, |Γ <lb/> Ji <lb/>γ J  f <lb/> (E)] <lb/> int <lb/> | = 7.48 eV. The sec-<lb/>ond solution leads to the constructive interference with the <lb/>non-resonant component at energies below the resonance <lb/>peak. We select this second solution because it is corrob-<lb/>orated by the microscopic calculations [27], where it has <lb/>been shown that the internal and external parts of the E1 <lb/> matrix elements have the same sign and very close magni-<lb/>tudes. Our choice is also supported by the single-particle <lb/>calculations [28,26]. Due to this constructive interference <lb/>we find the S-factor for <lb/> 13  N(p, γ) <lb/> 14  O to be larger than <lb/>previous estimates. Consequently, the transition from the <lb/>cold to hot CNO cycle for novae would be controlled by <lb/>the slowest proton capture reaction <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O. <lb/> 3 Trojan Horse <lb/> The Trojan Horse method (THM) is a powerful indirect <lb/>method which selects the quasi-free (QF) contribution of <lb/>an appropriate three-body reaction performed at energies <lb/>well above the Coulomb barrier to extract a charged par-<lb/>ticle two-body cross section at astrophysical energies free <lb/>of Coulomb suppression. The THM has been suggested <lb/>by Baur [9] and has been advanced and practically ap-<lb/>plied by a group from the Universitá di Catania work-<lb/>ing at the INFN-Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Catania <lb/>in collaboration with other institutions (see [5] and refer-<lb/>ences therein). The THM has already been applied many <lb/>times to reactions connected with fundamental astrophys-<lb/>ical problems [29,30] such as <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He, <lb/> 6  Li(d, α) <lb/> 4  He, <lb/> 6  Li(p, α) <lb/> 3  He, and many others, see [5] and references <lb/>therein. <lb/>Let us consider the TH reaction <lb/> a + A → y + b + B, <lb/> (26) <lb/>where a = (xy). The subreaction of interest is <lb/> x + A → b + B. <lb/> (27) <lb/>In the TH method the incident particle a is accelerated <lb/>to energies above the Coulomb barrier. After penetration <lb/>through the barrier the projectile breaks into x+y leaving <lb/>the fragment x to interact with target A, while the second <lb/>fragment-spectator y leaves carrying away the excess en-<lb/>ergy. By a proper choice of the final particle kinematics, <lb/>the THM allows one to extract the cross section of the <lb/>sub-process (27). However, the extracted amplitude of the <lb/>reaction (27) in the THM is half-off-energy shell because <lb/>the initial particle x in the sub-process (27) is off-the-<lb/>energy shell. It has been suggested in the original paper [9] <lb/>that the virtuality of particle x is compensated for by the <lb/>higher momentum components in the Fermi motion of the <lb/>fragments x and y inside the projectile a. However, high <lb/>momentum components means that the distance between <lb/>the fragments is so small that the interaction between the <lb/>fragments is not negligible and the mechanism of the re-<lb/>action is more complicated than the QF one. Instead, the <lb/>virtuality of particle x in the extracted cross section is sig-<lb/>nificantly compensated if we take into account the binding <lb/>energy of the fragments x and y in the projectile a [31]. <lb/>The THM allows one to determine both direct and res-<lb/>onant reactions (27). As an example of the result achieved <lb/>using the THM, we present in fig. 3 the astrophysical <lb/>factor for the <lb/> 3  He(d, p) <lb/> 4  He process determined from the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 6  Li, α p) <lb/> 4  He TH reaction [32]. The TH resonant cross <lb/>section (full dots) is normalized to the direct experimental <lb/>data (open circles and open triangles) at energies near the <lb/>resonance peak. The black on-line solid line is the result <lb/>of a fit of the TH data (see ref. [32] for details), showing <lb/>the trend of the bare nucleus S(E)-factor, while the blue <lb/>on-line solid line is obtained by interpolating the screened <lb/>direct data. <lb/></body>

Pole diagram describing the quasi-free mechanism. <lb/> 3.1 TH reaction amplitude <lb/> A simple mechanism describing the TH process is the so-<lb/>called QF process shown in fig. 4. In the quasi-free process <lb/>it is assumed that the incident particle (assume incident <lb/>particle is A) interacts with one of the fragments of a = <lb/>(xy), say with x which is considered to be &quot; quasifree &quot; , <lb/>while the second fragment is considered to be a &quot; passive &quot; <lb/>spectator which is not involved in the process. Thus the <lb/>interaction of the spectator y with x and A in the knockout <lb/>process is neglected. The fact that the fragment x is not <lb/>free is taken into account by folding the quasi-free reaction <lb/>amplitude with the Fourier component of the (xy) bound-<lb/>state wave function which takes into account the Fermi <lb/>motion of x in the bound state a = (xy). <lb/>In this section we present a derivation of the TH reac-<lb/>tion amplitude from the general 2 → 3 reaction amplitude <lb/>for the TH process (26). A general expression for the am-<lb/>plitude of the reaction is given by <lb/> M = <lb/> χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B <lb/> ΔV  f  (1 + G <lb/> +  ΔV  i  ) <lb/> ϕ  A  ϕ  a  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> (28) <lb/>= <lb/> χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B <lb/> (ΔV  f  G <lb/> +  + 1)ΔV  i <lb/> ϕ  A  ϕ  a  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> . <lb/> (29) <lb/>The amplitudes (28) and (29) are the post and prior forms <lb/>of the exact amplitude. Let us consider the post form. <lb/>Here, G <lb/> +  is the total Green function of the system a + A, <lb/>χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> is the distorted wave describing the scattering wave <lb/>function of a + A in the initial state of the reaction, χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB <lb/> is the distorted wave describing the scattering of particles <lb/> b + B in the final state: the distorted wave χ <lb/> − <lb/> yF  describes <lb/>the distorted wave of the spectator y and the center of <lb/>mass of the system F = b+B in the final state. For the mo-<lb/>ment we assume that Coulomb interactions are screened. <lb/>Eventually we can take the limit of the screening radius <lb/>to infinity. Also ϕ  i  is the bound state wave function of <lb/>nucleus i, <lb/>ΔV  i  = V  aA  − U  aA  , <lb/> (30) <lb/> ΔV  f  = V  bB  − U  bB  + V  yF  − U  yF  , <lb/> (31) <lb/> V  ij  and U  ij  are the interaction potential and optical po-<lb/>tential between particles i and j. For example, V  aA  = <lb/> V  xA  + V  yA  . To extract the amplitude of the subprocess <lb/> x + A → b + B, which is the final goal of the TH method, <lb/>we note that the Hamiltonian of the system a + A is <lb/> H = H  aA  +H  a  +H  A  = H  xA  +H  yF  +H  x  +H  A  +H  y  , (32) <lb/>where H  i  is the internal Hamiltonian of nucleus i and <lb/> H  ij  = T  ij  + V  ij  is the Hamiltonian of the relative mo-<lb/>tion of nuclei i and j, T  ij  is their relative kinetic energy <lb/>operator and V  ij  is their interaction potential. The total <lb/>Green&apos;s function operator can be written as <lb/> G <lb/> +  = <lb/>1 <lb/> E − H  aA  − H  a  − H  A  + i0 <lb/> (33) <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/> E − H  xA  − H  yF  − H  0 <lb/> xyA  + i0 <lb/> (34) <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/> E − H  xA  − T  yF  − U  yF  − ΔV  yF  − H  0 <lb/> xyA  + i0 <lb/> (35) <lb/>= ˜ <lb/> G <lb/> +  + G <lb/> +  ΔV  yF  <lb/> +  , <lb/> (36) <lb/>Here ΔV  f  = V  yF  − U  yF  , V  yF  = V  yx  + V  yA  , <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> xyA  = H  x  + H  y  + H  A  and <lb/>˜ <lb/> G <lb/> +  = <lb/>1 <lb/> E − H  xA  − T  yF  − U  yF  − H  0 <lb/> xyA  + i0 <lb/> (37) <lb/>We substitute eq. (37) into (28) and drop the term <lb/> ΔV  f  G <lb/> +  ΔV  yF  <lb/> +  ΔV  i  as the higher order term in the per-<lb/>turbation expansion over ΔV . Then we get from eq. (28) <lb/> M = <lb/> χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B <lb/> ΔV  f  (1 + ˜ <lb/> G <lb/> +  ΔV  i  ) <lb/> ϕ  A  ϕ  a  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> . <lb/> (38) <lb/> 212 <lb/> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> To single out the TH subprocess amplitude we replace <lb/> ΔV  i  = V  xA  + V  yA  − U  aA  by V  xA  and ΔV  f  = V  yF  − U  yF  + <lb/> V  bB  −U  bB  by ΔV  bB  = V  bB  −U  bB  . Then the amplitude (28) <lb/>becomes <lb/> M = <lb/> χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B <lb/> ΔV  bB  (1 + ˜ <lb/> G <lb/> +  V  xA  ) <lb/> ϕ  A  ϕ  a  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> = <lb/> χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B <lb/> ΔV  bB  (1 + G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  V  xA  ) <lb/> ϕ  A  ϕ  a  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i <lb/> . <lb/> (39) <lb/>Here <lb/> G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  = <lb/>1 <lb/> E  xA  − H  xA  + i0 <lb/> (40) <lb/>and E  xA  is the relative kinetic energy of particles x and <lb/> A.

It contains <lb/>a factor 1+G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  V  xA  . For the on-shell case, the relative mo-<lb/>mentum of particles x and A p  xA  = k  xA  , where k  xA  is the <lb/> x − A on-shell relative momentum related with their rel-<lb/>ative kinetic energy as E  xA  = p <lb/> 2 <lb/> xA  /(2 μ  xA  ). Correspond-<lb/>ingly, <lb/>(1 + G <lb/> +  V  xA  )|e <lb/> ikxA·rxA <lb/>  = χ <lb/> + <lb/> kxA  (r  xA  ) <lb/>(42) <lb/>is the scattering wave function of particles x and A in-<lb/>teracting via the optical potential V  xA  . We assume at the <lb/>moment that all the Coulomb interactions are screened. <lb/>However, in the TH method the entry particle x is not free <lb/>because it is in the bound state a = (xy), i.e. the momen-<lb/>tum of x is not fixed. In other words, x is off-the-energy <lb/>shell because E  xA  = p <lb/> 2 <lb/> xA  /(2 μ  xA  ). For the off-shell case <lb/>(1 + G <lb/> +  V  xA  )|e <lb/> ipxA·rxA <lb/>  = χ <lb/> + <lb/>(os)kxA,pxA  (r  xA  ) <lb/>(43) <lb/>is the so-called off-shell scattering function. <lb/> 3.2 TH method for direct reactions <lb/> We first consider the direct subreaction (27). We assume <lb/>that this reaction proceeds through the transfer of parti-<lb/>cle c from A to x (it can be also considered as a particle <lb/>transfer from x to A), i.e. A = (Bc) and b = (xc). The <lb/> &quot; pole &quot; diagram corresponding to the on-shell reaction de-<lb/>scribing the particle c transfer mechanism with the x − A <lb/> rescattering in the initial and b − B rescattering in the <lb/>final state is shown in fig. 5. This diagram describes the <lb/>DWBA amplitude. To simplify eq. (39) in the case of the <lb/>direct transfer subprocess, we insert the projection opera-<lb/>tors <lb/> |ϕ  x  ϕ  x  |, <lb/> |ϕ  B  ϕ  B  | and <lb/> |ϕ  c  ϕ  c  | into the bra <lb/>and ket states. The sum is taken over discrete states and <lb/>an integral is used for the continuum states of the cor-<lb/>responding nucleus. We leave in the projection operator <lb/>only the ground state projections |ϕ  x  ϕ  x  |, |ϕ  B  ϕ  B  | and <lb/> |ϕ  c  ϕ  c  | assuming that only the ground states of x, B and <lb/> c contribute to the reaction. If necessary the excited states <lb/> Fig. 5. Pole diagram describing the direct reaction x + A → <lb/> b + B mechanism. Bubbles show the initial and final state in-<lb/>teractions. <lb/> can also be taken into account. Then we get <lb/> ϕ  y  ϕ  b  ϕ  B  |ΔV  bB  (1 + G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  V  xA  )|ϕ  A  ϕ  a  <lb/>≈ ≈ϕ  b  |ϕ  c  ϕ  x  ϕ  B  |ΔV  bB  |ϕ  B  <lb/>×(1 + ϕ  x  |G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  |ϕ  x  ϕ  x  |V  xA  |ϕ  x  ) <lb/>× ×ϕ  c  ϕ  B  |ϕ  A  ϕ  x  ϕ  y  |ϕ  a  <lb/> (44) <lb/>We introduce the overlap functions I <lb/> α <lb/>βγ  = ϕ  β  ϕ  γ  |ϕ  α  and <lb/>use the approximation ϕ  x  |V  xA  |ϕ  x  ≈ U  xA  ; also we use <lb/>the approximation <lb/> ϕ  x  |G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  |ϕ  x  ≈ G <lb/> (U )+ <lb/> xA <lb/> = (E  xA  − T  xA  − U  xA  + i0) <lb/> −1  . <lb/> (45) <lb/>Note that ϕ  B  |ΔV  bB  |ϕ  B  ≈ V  xB  + V  cB  − U  bB  , where V  jB <lb/> is the interaction potential between the point like nuclei <lb/> j = x, c and B. All the neglected terms are higher order in <lb/>the perturbation theory over ΔV . Then we get in lowest <lb/>order for the TH amplitude with the subprocess described <lb/>by the direct transfer reaction (27): <lb/> M = χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  [χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> bB  I <lb/> b <lb/>xc  |ΔV  bB  | I <lb/> A <lb/>cB  (1 + G <lb/> + <lb/> xA  V  xA  )] I <lb/> a <lb/>xy  χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i  . <lb/> (46) <lb/>The expression in the brackets is the amplitude of subre-<lb/>action (27) which is the final goal of the TH. To see it we <lb/>just rewrite (46) in momentum space: <lb/> M = <lb/> dp  yF <lb/> (2 π)  3 <lb/> dp  xA <lb/> (2 π)  3  χ <lb/>  * (−) <lb/> yF  (p  yF  )M <lb/> sub  (k  bB  , p  xA  )I <lb/> a <lb/>xy  (p  xy  ) <lb/> ×χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i  (p  xA  ), <lb/>(47) <lb/>where <lb/> p  xy  = <lb/> m  y  p  x  − m  x  p  y <lb/> m  x  + m  y <lb/> = <lb/> m  y <lb/> m  x <lb/> p  a  − p  y  . <lb/> (48) <lb/>Also note that in the center of mass of TH reaction <lb/> a + A → y + b + B the relative momentum is given by <lb/> p  aA  = p  a  and p  yF  = p  y  . We denote by p  i  (k  i  ) the mo-<lb/>mentum of the virtual (real) particle i and by p  ij  (k  ij  ) the <lb/>relative momentum of virtual (real) particles i and j. Also <lb/> χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> i  (p  xA  ) ≡ χ <lb/> (+) <lb/> kaA  (p  xA  ), i.e. it is the Fourier component <lb/>of the a−A scattering wave function with the incident mo-<lb/>mentum k  aA  which in the center of mass of the TH reac-<lb/>tion is just k  a  . Correspondingly χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> yF  (p  yF  ) ≡ χ <lb/> (−) <lb/> kyF  (p  yF  ). <lb/></body>

(68) <lb/> 4 Summary <lb/> In this work we have addressed two important indi-<lb/>rect techniques in nuclear astrophysics use, asymptotic <lb/>normalization coefficient (ANC) and Trojan Horse (TH) <lb/>methods. Both techniques allow one to determine the as-<lb/>trophysical factors at Gamow peak or even at zero energy <lb/>avoiding the extrapolation procedure. The ANC method <lb/>determines the overall normalization of the peripheral ra-<lb/>diative capture processes. The ANC technique becomes <lb/>especially powerful for astrophysical processes proceeding <lb/>through a subthreshold state —a loosely bound state. In <lb/>this case the ANC determines both the overall normal-<lb/>ization of the direct radiative capture to the subthreshold <lb/>state and the resonance partial width for captures through <lb/>the subthreshold resonance. We demonstrated the applica-<lb/>tion of the ANC technique for the key CNO cycle reaction <lb/> 14  N(p, γ) <lb/> 15  O. The ANC method turns out to be useful <lb/>also for determination of the sign of the interference term <lb/>of the resonant and nonresonant radiative capture ampli-<lb/>tudes. We demonstrated it for two important CNO cycle <lb/>reactions: <lb/> 11  C(p, γ) <lb/> 12  N and <lb/> 13  N(p, γ) <lb/> 14  O. <lb/>The TH method allows one to determine the as-<lb/>trophysical factors for astrophysical reactions, both <lb/>direct and resonant. In practical applications the as-<lb/>trophysical factor extracted from the TH reaction is <lb/>available in a wide energy range from astrophysical <lb/>energies to higher energies. Its absolute normalization <lb/>is determined by normalization of the TH astrophysical <lb/>factor to the one obtained from direct measurements <lb/>at higher energies. Assuming that the energy depen-<lb/>dence of the TH astrophysical factor is correct, one <lb/>can determine the absolute astrophysical factor at <lb/>astrophysical energies. In this work we have derived a <lb/>general expression for the TH reaction amplitude which <lb/>takes into account the off-shell effects and initial and <lb/>final state interactions. The direct and resonant TH <lb/>reactions are considered separately. We derived the TH <lb/>amplitude for direct subreactions in terms of the off-shell <lb/>scattering wave function. The energy dependence of this <lb/>wave function determines the energy dependence of the <lb/>TH astrophysical factor for an arbitrary direct reaction <lb/>mechanism. We connect the TH resonant cross section <lb/>with the on-shell resonant cross section. We intend to use <lb/>the derived equations to calculate the absolute astrophys-<lb/>ical factors. <lb/> This work was supported by the U.S. Department of En-<lb/>ergy under Grant No. DE-FG03-93ER40773, the U.S. Na-<lb/>tional Science Foundation under Grant No. INT-9909787 and <lb/>Grant No. PHY-0140343, ME 385(2000) and ME 643(2003) <lb/>projects NSF and MSMT, CR, project K1048102 and grant <lb/>No. 202/05/0302 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, <lb/>and by the Robert A.

			<body> Abstract. In this paper we present first results from a <lb/> 8  Li electromagnetic neutron-breakup experiment. <lb/>Specific reactions studied were Pb( <lb/> 8  Li, <lb/> 7  Li+n)Pb and C( <lb/> 8  Li, <lb/> 7  Li+n)C at 41 MeV/nucleon beam energy. This <lb/>is an effort to compare the results of a Coulomb dissociation experiment with the well determined (n, γ) <lb/> reaction cross sections at astrophysical energies. The angular dependence of the cross section above 7 degree, <lb/>which is the grazing angle of <lb/> 8  Li-Pb system, is similar in shape for lead and carbon and approximately <lb/>proportional to A <lb/> 2/3  in magnitude indicating that the nuclear dissociation is the main component in <lb/>this region. At very forward angles the angular distributions differ significantly and the electromagnetic <lb/>dissociation dominates for the lead, although the nuclear contribution is not negligible. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 25.70.De Coulomb excitation <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Many astrophysical nuclear processes, such as the r-<lb/>process, involve neutron capture by short-lived nuclei. Di-<lb/>rect measurement of these reactions are not available be-<lb/>cause one cannot make a target of these nuclei.

Another approach is <lb/>Coulomb breakup where the inverse reaction is investi-<lb/>gated. This inverse method has been applied already in <lb/>several experiments and generally good agreements with <lb/>theoretical estimates are found for dissociation cross sec-<lb/>tions [2]. <lb/>However, there have not been experimental investiga-<lb/>tions of the validity of the assumptions associated with <lb/> a  e-mail: akos@ludens.elte.hu <lb/> extracting information from the inverse reaction. For ex-<lb/>ample, it is known that the excited states of the result-<lb/>ing nucleus following neutron capture plays an important <lb/>role [3]. The radioactive beam contains only ground state <lb/>nuclei. Therefore, when the inverse method is applied, the <lb/>contribution of capture to an excited state should be taken <lb/>into account theoretically. <lb/>Another concern relates to the calculation of the neu-<lb/>tron capture cross section from the experimental results <lb/>of the dissociation. The neutron breakup can occur from <lb/>either nuclear or electromagnetic interaction. The contri-<lb/>bution of the nuclear breakup has to be measured and <lb/>removed from the total yield. The proper way to do this <lb/>needs verification. <lb/>This paper will present first experimental results to <lb/>check the validity of the inverse method.

			<body> is stable, and the neutron capture has been measured di-<lb/>rectly in several experiments [3,4] including bombardment <lb/>by thermal and fast neutrons. These results showed that <lb/>the capture obey a 1/v law below 254 keV where a reso-<lb/>nance peak is located. <lb/>As the (n, γ) reaction for <lb/> 7  Li is well known, the in-<lb/>verse process can be used to provide better understanding <lb/>of the Coulomb dissociation process. This is the first de-<lb/>tailed study of a Coulomb dissociation reaction (energy <lb/>dependence and angular distributions) where the associ-<lb/>ated, well-established (n, γ) reaction is known. <lb/> 2 The method of Coulomb dissociation and <lb/>its experimental difficulties <lb/> The dissociation of nuclei passing through the strong elec-<lb/>tric field of a heavy nucleus can be described as an absorp-<lb/>tion of a virtual photon (γ) from the target field, followed <lb/>by emission of a neutron [5]. The (γ, n) reaction can be <lb/>then related to the inverse (n, γ) reaction of astrophysi-<lb/>cal interest via detailed balance. The (γ, n) cross section <lb/>is much larger than the corresponding (n, γ) cross section <lb/>at astrophysical energies because of the difference in wave <lb/>numbers between γ and neutron. As the electromagnetic <lb/>interaction is well known, this simple, powerful model is <lb/>often used. <lb/>When applying the method, one will face several ques-<lb/>tions that can result in systematic errors. One must con-<lb/>sider that the capture by a ground state nucleus can lead <lb/>to a ground state or excited states [3]. Another question <lb/>concerns the excited states of the capturing nuclei. This <lb/>will give difficulties if it occurs in the dissociation pro-<lb/>cess, since the dissociation into the ground state should be <lb/>measured. But for those captures when the contributions <lb/>from excited states are small, they can be theoretically <lb/>corrected. A detailed experimental investigation can show <lb/>the importance of this circumstance and would provide a <lb/>way to correct for it. <lb/>The most important systematic ambiguity is the nu-<lb/>clear contribution in the breakup. Since the inverse of the <lb/>neutron capture is only electromagnetic dissociation, the <lb/>contribution of the nuclear breakup should be well un-<lb/>derstood. The general way to estimate and subtract the <lb/>contribution relies on an empirical method. The most used <lb/>depends on A <lb/> 1/3  systematics. In this model, one can as-<lb/>sume that the neutron removal can occur only at the cir-<lb/>cumference of the target viewed from the beam direction. <lb/>The angular dependence of the two types of dissociation is <lb/>well known. The nuclear dissociation can occur at larger <lb/>scattering angles compared to the Coulomb dissociation <lb/>that is limited to angles below the grazing angle. There-<lb/>fore, the angular distribution of the breakup on several <lb/>targets is one way to determine the correction factors for <lb/>a particular target for the electromagnetic dissociation [6]. <lb/>Another aspect is the calculation of the virtual pho-<lb/>ton numbers. This is theoretically well established but de-<lb/>pends on the closest approach of the colliding nuclei. With <lb/>the precise measurement of the scattering angle, it is pos-<lb/>sible to select different impact parameters of the reaction. <lb/>As the model of Coulomb dissociation is based on first-<lb/>order perturbation theory, some questions still arise due to <lb/>higher-order effects (i.e., dynamical effects and relativistic <lb/>effects) [7]. The neutron capture generally is dominated by <lb/>an E1 transition, but in the breakup there are a number of <lb/> E2 virtual photons available. Experimental results of lon-<lb/>gitudinal momentum distribution of the fragment showed <lb/>that the E1-E2 process can interfere [8]. <lb/>These questions have never been verified experimen-<lb/>tally and left room for systematical errors. Although these <lb/>points were discussed many times for the <lb/> 8  B breakup re-<lb/>action, which is a very important reaction in the solar <lb/>neutrino problem, and several efforts have been made to <lb/>clarify nuclear or E2 contributions [9], no attempt have <lb/>been made to study Coulomb dissociation reaction sys-<lb/>tematics in detail. <lb/> 3 The experimental procedure <lb/> The experiment was performed at the Coupled Cyclotron <lb/>Facility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab-<lb/>oratory at Michigan State University. A <lb/> 8  Li beam of <lb/>41.2 MeV/nucleon bombarded a lead (carbon) target of <lb/>56.7 (28.8) mg/cm <lb/> 2  thickness, respectively. The experi-<lb/>mental setup is shown in fig. 1. The direction of the in-<lb/>coming <lb/> 8  Li was measured with a pair of Cathode Read-<lb/>out Drift Chamber (CRDC) detectors [10]. A thin plastic <lb/>scintillator placed in front of the target provided the start <lb/>pulse for the time of flight (ToF). The neutrons were de-<lb/>tected with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) which <lb/>consists of 9 layers of 16 scintillator bars, 10 cm × 10 cm × <lb/> 2 m each [11,12]. The charged particles were deflected by <lb/>the Sweeper Magnet [13] and their positions were mea-<lb/>sured after the magnet with two CRDCs separated by 1m. <lb/>Thin and thick plastic scintillators were used to identify <lb/>the particles by their energy loss. The thin plastic detec-<lb/>tor also provides trigger signal for the measurement. Mea-<lb/>surements without any target were performed to deduce <lb/>contributions from reactions in the start detector. <lb/>In the Coulomb dissociation reaction, the relative en-<lb/>ergy between <lb/> 7  Li and n is determined by their relative <lb/>velocities event by event. The neutron velocity vector is <lb/>deduced from the position of the scintillator bar hit in <lb/>MoNA, and the ToF between the target and the particu-<lb/>lar bar. Horizontal position at MoNA is calculated from <lb/>the time difference between the two photomultipliers at-<lb/>tached at the left and right ends of each bar. The relation <lb/>between time difference and position was carefully exam-<lb/>ined with cosmic-ray events. The vertical and longitudinal <lb/>position of the neutron was determined from the position <lb/>of the bar. The ToF was calibrated with prompt γ-rays <lb/> from a thick target. The velocity was deduced from ToF <lb/>between the pulse of the thin plastic scintillator and the <lb/>mean time of the two photomultipliers. <lb/>To deduce the velocity of the <lb/> 7  Li particle, more elabo-<lb/>rate efforts were necessary. As the primary purpose of the <lb/>Sweeper Magnet was to sweep the charged particles off <lb/>and pass the neutrons through its large vertical gap, the <lb/>magnetic field is not uniform over the whole region.

Experimental setup; &quot; x, y &quot; : CRDC detectors, &quot; t, dE &quot; : thin plastic detector, &quot; E &quot; : thick plastic detector. <lb/> understand the characteristics of the charged particle tra-<lb/>jectory in the Sweeper Magnet, the program &quot; COSY infin-<lb/> ity &quot;  [14] was employed. From the measured magnetic field, <lb/>COSY can produce a forward map, which relates position, <lb/>direction and the rigidity of the particle at the target to <lb/>the position and direction after the magnet. Because of the <lb/>nonuniformity of the field, there are significant deviations <lb/>between the calculated trajectory with the forward map <lb/>and the actual trajectory for the particles with large angle <lb/>or with large momentum difference relative to the particle <lb/>at the central trajectory. This problem can be solved by <lb/>using multiple maps for various incident parameters. How-<lb/>ever, to trace back the particle from the detector after the <lb/>magnet to the target position, this procedure did not allow <lb/>COSY to create an inverse map. We employed the novel <lb/>technique of a neural network [15]. As the position data of <lb/>the particle at the target position is also known from the <lb/>beam tracking CRDCs event by event, we have enough <lb/>information to deduce the rigidity and direction of the <lb/>particle at the target. A Monte Carlo simulation using the <lb/>forward map provides a set of events, which is used to train <lb/>the neural network. Obtained parameters were further <lb/>tested with another set of simulated events. These steps <lb/>were repeated until a satisfactory conversion was obtained. <lb/> 4 Results and discussion <lb/> Using this technique, the momentum and the velocity vec-<lb/>tor of the <lb/> 7  Li particles were successfully deduced. The re-<lb/>sults for angular distributions are displayed in fig. 2. The <lb/>upper panel shows the net yields for the lead target and <lb/>the carbon target, respectively, normalized by the number <lb/>of incoming particles and the target thickness. The con-<lb/>tribution from reactions in the thin scintillator in front of <lb/>the target was subtracted using &quot; blank target &quot; runs. The <lb/>carbon yield is multiplied by a factor of 6.7 for comparison <lb/>purpose.

Carbon data is multiplied by <lb/>factor 6.7 (see text). Lower panel: Pb/C ratio of the angular <lb/>distributions. <lb/> a clear difference of the angular distributions for the two <lb/>targets can be seen. For the lead target, there is a clear <lb/>enhancement at forward angles less than 6 degrees. This <lb/>shows the dominance of the Coulomb dissociation process <lb/>at forward angles. Small yields below 1 degree may cor-<lb/>respond to the cutoff of virtual photons i.e., the number <lb/>of virtual photons whose energy is high enough to disso-<lb/>ciate <lb/> 8  Li (2.033 MeV) decreases significantly at the large <lb/>impact parameter. The carbon target data, on the other <lb/>hand, shows a rather flat distribution with a maximum at <lb/>around 3–4 degree. Above 7 degree, which is the grazing <lb/>angle of the <lb/> 8  Li+Pb system at 41 MeV/A, the two distri-<lb/>butions have the same shape, indicating the nuclear dis-<lb/>sociation dominates in these angular regions for both tar-<lb/>gets. Using the factor 6.7 mentioned above, the magnitude <lb/>of the two angular distributions matches above 6 degrees. <lb/></body>

			<body> The lower panel of the figure shows the ratio between <lb/>two distributions. This ratio may give a better insight of <lb/>the target dependence, as the finite acceptance effect is <lb/>cancelled out in part. For large angles, the ratio is almost a <lb/>constant. This constant 6.7 corresponds to A <lb/> 2/3  scaling of <lb/>lead over carbon. With the often used A <lb/> 1/3  factor, the two <lb/>distributions differ in magnitude. As the angle decreases, <lb/>the ratio gradually becomes larger. At very forward angle, <lb/>this ratio exceeds 140 which is close to the Z <lb/> 2  ratio of <lb/>the targets. Further analysis, such as angular correlation <lb/>of the breakup particles (n and <lb/> 7  Li) and incident energy <lb/>dependence, which is now underway, will give more insight <lb/>to E2 contribution. <lb/>In summary, we showed the angular distributions <lb/>of the Coulomb dissociation for C and Pb target at <lb/>41 MeV/A <lb/> 8  Li beam energy. Above the grazing angle of <lb/>the reaction, the nuclear dissociation becomes dominant. <lb/>The Coulomb dissociation process dominates over nuclear <lb/>dissociation at forward angles, although nuclear contri-<lb/>bution is not negligible below 4 degrees. The present data <lb/>suggests that a more careful investigation of the angle and <lb/>energy dependence of the Coulomb dissociation reaction <lb/>method is clearly necessary to deduce the inverse (n, γ) <lb/> reaction cross section, which is important for the astro-<lb/>physical nuclear process. <lb/></body>

The Trojan Horse Method has been applied to the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 9  Be, <lb/> 6  Liα)n three-body reaction in order to <lb/>investigate the <lb/> 9  Be(p, α) <lb/> 6  Li two-body reaction, which is involved in the study of light element abundances <lb/>(lithium, beryllium and boron). A coincidence measurement was performed in order to identify the presence <lb/>of the quasi-free mechanism in the three-body reaction, needed for the application of the method. The <lb/>astrophysical S(E)-factor was extracted and compared to direct data. No information about electron <lb/>screening effects can be extracted due to the poor resolution of the indirect data. <lb/> PACS. 24.10.-i Nuclear reaction models and methods – 26.20.+f Hydrostatic stellar nucleosynthesis <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> In recent years the abundances of light elements lithium, <lb/>beryllium and boron (LiBeB) have been increasingly used <lb/>as diagnostics between different scenario for primordial <lb/>or stellar nucleosynthesis. As reported in [1], beryllium <lb/>primordial abundances can provide a powerful test to dis-<lb/>criminate between homogeneous and inhomogeneous pri-<lb/>mordial nucleosynthesis. Moreover, the study of beryllium <lb/>abundances in young stars, together with lithium and <lb/>boron, can provide a strong test for understanding stellar <lb/>structure and discriminate between possible non-standard <lb/>mixing processes in stellar interiors [2]. In both stellar and <lb/>primordial environments, however, LiBeB are mainly de-<lb/>stroyed by proton-capture reactions via the (p, α) channel <lb/>with a Gamow energy E  G  ranging from 10 keV (for stellar <lb/>nucleosynthesis) to 100 keV (for primordial nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis). These energies are low if compared with the Coulomb <lb/>barrier E  C  usually of the order of MeV, thus implying the <lb/>reactions take place via tunnel effect with an exponential <lb/>decrease of the cross section to nano or pico barn values. <lb/>The behavior of the direct cross sections are usually ex-<lb/>trapolated at the astrophysical interest region from higher <lb/>energies by using the definition of the astrophysical factor <lb/> S(E) = E · σ(E) · exp(2πη) <lb/>(1) <lb/>(where η is the Sommerfeld parameter) which varies <lb/>smoothly with energy. Nevertheless this extrapolation pro-<lb/>cedure can introduce some uncertainties due, for example, <lb/> a  e-mail: romano@lns.infn.it <lb/> to the presence of unexpected subthreshold resonances or <lb/>electron screening effects [3]. <lb/>However, in recent years, many indirect methods [4, <lb/>5,6,7,8,9,10] have been developed in order to extract the <lb/> S(E)-factor without extrapolations. In particular the Tro-<lb/>jan Horse Method (THM) [8,9,10] represents a powerful <lb/>tool which select the quasi-free (QF) contribution of a <lb/>suitable three-body reaction under appropriate kinemati-<lb/>cal conditions. The energy in the entrance channel of the <lb/>three-body reaction is chosen well above the Coulomb bar-<lb/>rier to extract the two-body cross section at astrophysical <lb/>energies free of Coulomb suppression. In the present pa-<lb/>per we present the results of the study of the two-body <lb/> 9  Be(p, α) <lb/> 6  Li reaction, obtained through the application <lb/>of THM to the three-body <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 9  Be, <lb/> 6  Liα)n reaction. <lb/> 2 The Trojan Horse Method <lb/> The basic idea of the THM [8,9,10] is to extract a two-<lb/>body a + b → c + d reaction cross section from the QF <lb/>contribution of a suitable three-body a + x → c + d + s <lb/> reaction. Here the x nucleus shows a strong b ⊕ s cluster <lb/>structure and, in the Impulse Approximation (IA) descrip-<lb/>tion, only b interacts with a, whereas s is considered to be <lb/>spectator to the virtual two-body reaction. <lb/>The Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) <lb/>leads to a factorization of the three-body reaction cross <lb/>section: <lb/>d <lb/> 3  σ <lb/> dE  c  dΩ  c  dΩ  d <lb/> ∝ KF <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  of f <lb/> · |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (2) <lb/></body>

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> where KF is a kinematical factor, (dσ/dΩ) <lb/> of f  is the off-<lb/>energy-shell differential cross section for the two-body <lb/> a(b, c)d reaction and |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  is the s momentum distri-<lb/>bution in x. Under these assumptions, if |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  is known <lb/>(KF is calculated), a quantity which is proportional to the <lb/>two-body cross section can be extracted from a measure-<lb/>ment of the three-body d <lb/> 3  σ/dE  c  dΩ  c  dΩ  d  cross section. <lb/>The above-mentioned assumptions and the validity <lb/>tests carried out from the data analysis are fully discussed <lb/>in [10] and references therein. <lb/>Moreover in the THM approach [9,10] the initial pro-<lb/>jectile velocity is compensated for by the binding energy <lb/>of particle b inside x. Thus the two-body reaction can be <lb/>induced at very low relative energies. If the incoming en-<lb/>ergy E  a  is chosen high enough to overcome the Coulomb <lb/>barrier in the entrance channel of the three-body reac-<lb/>tion, both Coulomb barrier and electron screening effects <lb/>are negligible in the two-body THM data. The cluster b <lb/> is brought into the nuclear interaction region and the x <lb/> nucleus is considered as a Trojan Horse. <lb/>We stress that in view of the various approximations <lb/>involved in the THM and in particular of the assump-<lb/>tion that off-energy-shell effects are negligible, one cannot <lb/>extract the absolute value of the two-body cross section. <lb/>However, the absolute value can be obtained through nor-<lb/>malization to the direct data available at energies above <lb/>the Coulomb barrier. <lb/>Moreover, as already mentioned, the THM data are not <lb/>affected by electron screening. Therefore, once the behav-<lb/>ior of the absolute bare S  b  (E)-factor from the two-body <lb/>cross-section is extracted, a model-independent estimate <lb/>of the screening potential U  e  can be obtained from com-<lb/>parison with the direct screened S(E)-factor. <lb/> The aim of the present experiment was to extract the <lb/>cross section of the <lb/> 9  Be+p → <lb/> 6  Li+α reaction after select-<lb/>ing the QF contribution of <lb/> 9  Be + d → <lb/> 6  Li + α + n reaction. <lb/>The deuteron was used like trojan horse nucleus, due to <lb/>its p⊕n structure [11]; in this framework the proton acts <lb/>like participant while the neutron is the spectator to the <lb/>virtual two-body reaction. <lb/> 3 Experimental procedure <lb/> The experiment was performed at the Laboratori Nazion-<lb/>ali del Sud in Catania. The SMP Tandem Van de Graaf <lb/>accelerator provided a 22 MeV <lb/> 9  Be beam which was ac-<lb/>curately collimated in order to have a spot diameter of <lb/>about 2 mm and intensities up to 2–5 pnA. A deuter-<lb/>ated polyethylene target (CD  2  ) of about 190 μg/cm <lb/> 2  was <lb/>placed at 90 <lb/> •  with respect to the beam direction. A sil-<lb/>icon ΔE-E telescope was placed at about 70 cm from <lb/>the target with an angle of about 45 <lb/> •  for a continuous <lb/>monitoring of the target thickness during the experiment. <lb/>The particle detection was performed by using two silicon <lb/> ΔE-E telescopes, with a position-sensitive detector (PSD) <lb/>as E. The telescopes were placed at opposite sides with <lb/>respect to the beam direction at a distance from the tar-<lb/>get d = 25 cm. The detection angular ranges were 11.5 <lb/> •  – <lb/>25.5 <lb/> •  (telescope devoted to <lb/> 6  Li detection) and 14.5 <lb/> •  –28.5 <lb/> • <lb/> Fig. 1. Experimental kinematic locus ELi vs. Eα for the coin-<lb/>cidence events. <lb/> (telescope for <lb/> 4  He detection). The displacement of the ex-<lb/>perimental setup was chosen by means of a Monte Carlo <lb/>simulation in order to cover the whole QF angular range. <lb/>The trigger for the event acquisition was given by the coin-<lb/>cidence of two particles hitting the two PSDs respectively. <lb/>Energy and position signals for the detected particles were <lb/>processed by standard electronics together with the coin-<lb/>cidence relative time and sent to the acquisition system <lb/>for on-line monitoring of the experiment and data storage <lb/>for the off-line analysis. <lb/>In order to perform position calibration, grids with <lb/>a number of equally spaced slits were placed in front of <lb/>each PSD. A correspondence between position signal from <lb/>the PSDs and detection angle of the particle was then <lb/>established. Energy calibration was performed by means <lb/>of a standard three-peak α source and α and <lb/> 6  Li particles <lb/>from <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 6  Li, α) <lb/> 14  N and <lb/> 12  C( <lb/> 6  Li, <lb/> 6  Li) <lb/> 12  C reactions. <lb/> 4 Data analysis <lb/> 4.1 Three-body reaction identification <lb/> After the position and energy calibration, Li and α par-<lb/>ticles detected in coincidence were selected with the stan-<lb/>dard ΔE-E technique. The kinematic locus (E  Li  vs. E  α  ) <lb/>(fig. 1) was reconstructed in very good agreement with <lb/>the simulation. Moreover the experimental Q-value spec-<lb/>trum for the three-body reaction was reconstructed un-<lb/>der the assumption of mass number 1 for the undetected <lb/>third particle. The result is shown in fig. 2, where it is <lb/>evident a peak centered at about −0.1 MeV according to <lb/>the expected theoretical value. The results of fig. 1 and <lb/>fig. 2 make us confident on the identification of the three-<lb/>body reaction exit channel. Events below the peak in the <lb/> S.

In such a small energy win-<lb/>dows the (dσ/dΩ) <lb/> of f  can be considered constant. Thus <lb/>the experimental |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  distribution was extracted by <lb/>dividing the three-body coincidence yield by the kinematic <lb/>factor. The result is compared with the theoretical one in <lb/>fig. 3. The agreement between experimental and theoreti-<lb/>cal momentum distribution represents a very strong check <lb/>for the existence of the QF mechanism in the present data. <lb/> 4.3 Validity tests for the THM and the astrophysical <lb/>S(E)-factor <lb/> After the identification of the QF mechanism only events <lb/>with spectator momentum |P  s  | &lt; 30 MeV/c were consid-<lb/>ered. <lb/> Fig. 3. Comparison between experimental (dots) and theoret-<lb/>ical Húlthen function (solid line) for the neutron momentum <lb/>distribution. Error bars are due to the statistical error. <lb/> A first test of validity of the THM approach is repre-<lb/>sented by the comparison between the indirectly extracted <lb/>angular distributions and the direct behavior. The rele-<lb/>vant angle in order to get the indirect angular distribu-<lb/>tions, i.e. the emission angle for the alpha-particle in the <lb/> 6  Li-α center of mass system, can be calculated according <lb/>to the relation [12] <lb/> θ  cm  = arccos <lb/>(v  p  − v  t  ) · (v  C  − v  α  ) <lb/> |v  p  − v  t  ||v  C  − v  α  | <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where the vectors v  p  , v  t  , v  C  , v  α  are the velocities of pro-<lb/>jectile, transferred proton, and the outgoing <lb/> 6  Li and α-<lb/> particles, respectively. These quantities can be calculated <lb/>from their corresponding momenta in the laboratory sys-<lb/>tem, where the momentum of the transferred particle is <lb/>equal and opposite to that of neutron spectator, due to the <lb/>quasi-free assumption [12]. The angular distributions test <lb/>was performed for different <lb/> 6  Li-α relative energy intervals <lb/>and normalized to the direct data [13,14]. An example of <lb/>the result is shown in fig. 4. The error bars include both <lb/>statistical and normalization errors. The two-body cross <lb/>section is in arbitrary units and the solid lines show the <lb/>behavior of direct angular distribution [13,14]. The quite <lb/>fair agreement between the two trends makes us confident <lb/>on the validity of the IA. <lb/>A second validity test consists in the comparison be-<lb/>tween the behavior of the indirect excitation function with <lb/>the direct one. Therefore, by using the eq. (2), the quantity <lb/>(dσ/dΩ) <lb/> of f  has been extracted. It has to be emphasized <lb/>that in the present case the obtained cross section is the <lb/>nuclear part, the Coulomb barrier being already overcome <lb/>in entrance channel. In order to do the comparison the in-<lb/>direct two-body cross section was multiplied by Coulomb <lb/>penetration function, given in terms of regular and ir-<lb/>regular Coulomb functions (see [9,10,15] and references <lb/></body>

An exclusive measurement of the Coulomb breakup of <lb/> 8  B into <lb/> 7  Be+p at 254 A MeV was used to <lb/>infer the low-energy <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B cross section. Particular emphasis was placed on the angular correlations <lb/>of the breakup particles which demonstrate clearly that E1 multipolarity dominates within the angular <lb/>cuts selected for the analysis.

[3,4]). <lb/>It is essential, however, to further reduce the uncertainty <lb/>of nuclear inputs to the SSM in order to refine its predic-<lb/>tions. One critical quantity is the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B cross section <lb/>at solar energies since it is linearly related with the high-<lb/>energy solar neutrino flux stemming from <lb/> 8  B β-decay. <lb/> In recent years, many attempts have been undertaken <lb/>to measure this cross section (or, equivalent, the astro-<lb/>physical S  17  factor) with high-precision in direct-proton-<lb/>capture measurements using radioactive <lb/> 7  Be targets [5,6, <lb/>7,8]. A completely different approach with different sys-<lb/>tematic errors is Coulomb dissociation (CD) of <lb/> 8  B in the <lb/>electromagnetic field of a high-Z nucleus.

This contribution reports on a CD ex-<lb/>periment similar to that of ref. [11], but with an improved <lb/>experimental technique. Preliminary results of this study <lb/>have been published earlier [12]. In the present contri-<lb/>bution we present a re-evaluation of the published data <lb/>and show that the efficiency to detect low-energy break-up <lb/>events was slightly overestimated. As a consequence, the <lb/>lowest data points are increased by about 6–10% which <lb/>suggests a different theoretical model to extrapolate to <lb/>zero energy than used in ref. [12]. We have recently pub-<lb/>lished a full account of the present work [13]. <lb/> 2 Theoretical calculations <lb/> Realistic theoretical calculations of the CD of <lb/> 8  B are es-<lb/>sential for several reasons. From a practical point of view, <lb/>the relatively bad energy resolution of the CD method re-<lb/>quires to simulate, e.g., the effect of cross talk between <lb/>neighboring energy bins, of the finite size and resolution <lb/>of the tracking detectors etc. These simulations require a <lb/>CD event generator that is reasonably close to reality so <lb/>that the remaining differences between the measured and <lb/>simulated cross-section distributions can be attributed to <lb/>the S  17  factor. As input to the event generator we have <lb/>to specify a nuclear model for <lb/> 8  B and choose a method to <lb/>calculate Coulomb dissociation. <lb/>The simplest model for <lb/> 8  B is that of a p-wave proton <lb/>coupled to an inert <lb/> 7  Be core with I <lb/> π  = 3/2 <lb/> −  to form the <lb/> 8  B ground state with I <lb/> π  = 2 <lb/> +  .

Capture of <lb/> p- and f -waves followed by E2 emission plays an insignif-<lb/>icant role, in particular at solar energies. The resonant <lb/>component proceeds through the 1 <lb/> +  resonance at 633 keV <lb/>above threshold which decays mainly by M 1 emission and <lb/>is limited essentially to a narrow region around the reso-<lb/>nance energy. <lb/>Coulomb dissociation of <lb/> 8  B on <lb/> 208  Pb at 254 A MeV is <lb/>calculated in the semi-classical model in first-order per-<lb/>turbation theory (PT), as described in more detail else-<lb/>where [14,15,16]. This approach should be a good approx-<lb/>imation at the high bombarding energy used. Due to the <lb/>large number of E2 photons present in the virtual photon <lb/>spectrum seen by the <lb/> 8  B projectile, one can assume the <lb/> E2 component to be significantly enhanced compared to <lb/>the direct-capture case. This will be investigated experi-<lb/>mentally in our experiment. <lb/> 3 Experimental procedures <lb/> The <lb/> 8  B secondary beam was produced at the SIS/FRS <lb/>radioactive beam facility at GSI [17] by fragmenting a <lb/>350 A MeV <lb/> 12  C beam in a 8 g/cm <lb/> 2  Be target and separat-<lb/>ing it from contaminant ions in a 1.4 g/cm <lb/> 2  wedge-shaped <lb/>Al degrader placed in the FRS intermediate focal plane. <lb/>Typical <lb/> 8  B beam intensities in front of KaoS were 5 × 10 <lb/> 4 <lb/> ions per 4 s spill; the only contaminant consisted of about <lb/>20% <lb/> 7  Be ions which could be identified event by event <lb/>with the help of a time-of-flight measurement. For this <lb/>purpose a 3 mm thick plastic scintillator detector was in-<lb/>stalled in the transfer line between FRS and KaoS, about <lb/>85 m upstream from the breakup target, to serve as a time-<lb/>of-flight (ToF) start detector. Positions and angles of the <lb/>secondary beam incident on the Pb breakup target were <lb/>measured with the help of two parallel-plate avalanche <lb/>counters (PPAC) located at 308.5 cm and 71 cm upstream <lb/>from the target, respectively. The detectors had areas of <lb/>10 × 10 cm <lb/> 2  and allowed to track the incident <lb/> 8  B beam <lb/>with about 99% efficiency and with position and angular <lb/>resolutions of 1.3 mm and 1 mrad, respectively. In addi-<lb/>tion, they provided a ToF stop signal with a resolution <lb/>of 1.2 ns (FWHM). The <lb/> 8  B energy at the target was 254 <lb/> A MeV and was limited by the maximum bending power <lb/>of the KaoS spectrometer. <lb/>A schematic view of the experimental setup used in the <lb/>present experiment to detect the breakup of <lb/> 8  B in semi-<lb/>complete kinematics at the KaoS spectrometer at GSI is <lb/>shown in fig. 2. Apart from the PPAC tracking detectors <lb/>mentioned above, it consisted of i) the <lb/> 208  Pb break up <lb/>target; ii) two pairs of Si strip detectors; iii) the magnets <lb/>of the KaoS spectrometer; iv) two large-area multi-wire <lb/>proportional chambers (MWPC); v) a ToF wall serving <lb/>as a trigger detector. <lb/>Downstream from the Pb target (52 mg/cm <lb/> 2  of <lb/> 208  Pb), <lb/>the angles and positions as well as the energy losses of the <lb/>outgoing particles were measured with two pairs of single-<lb/>sided Si strip detectors (SSD, 300 μm thick, 100 μm pitch) <lb/>located at distances of about 14 cm and 31 cm downstream <lb/>from the target. <lb/>The KaoS magnetic spectrometer [18] consisted of a <lb/>large-aperture quadrupole and a horizontally focussing <lb/>dipole magnet. To avoid multiple scattering of the frag-<lb/>ments in air, the chamber inside the quadrupole and dipole <lb/>magnets was filled with He gas at 1 bar pressure. <lb/>Behind the magnets, two large-area MWPC were in-<lb/>stalled as close to the focal plane as possible. One cham-<lb/>ber, with horizontal and vertical dimensions of 60 cm and <lb/>40 cm, respectively, detected the position of protons be-<lb/>hind KaoS. The other one, 120 cm wide and 60 cm high, <lb/>was set to detect the <lb/> 8  B non-interacting beam and the <lb/> 7  Be fragments. <lb/>Behind the focal plane and parallel to it, a plastic-<lb/>scintillator wall with 30 elements (each 7 cm wide and 2 cm <lb/>thick) was installed and used for trigger purposes. The <lb/>wall was subdivided into two sections. Coincident signals <lb/>in the left-hand (proton) part and in the right-hand (ion) <lb/>part of the wall indicated a break-up event ( &quot; breakup &quot; <lb/>trigger). Singles hits in the right hand section were inter-<lb/>preted as &quot; beam &quot; triggers and recorded with a down-scale <lb/>factor of 1000. <lb/> 4 Data reduction and results <lb/> The experiment described in the present paper recorded <lb/>events from three different sources: <lb/>i) break-up events originating in the Pb target; <lb/>ii) down-scaled beam particles; <lb/>iii) background from a variety of sources (e.g., cosmic <lb/>rays). <lb/>Though event classes i) and ii) are mainly correlated <lb/>with a corresponding trigger type ( &quot; breakup &quot; trigger for <lb/>class i), &quot; beam &quot; trigger for class ii)) we have checked if by <lb/>chance the trigger types and event classes were mixed in <lb/>rare cases, and have corrected for that. <lb/>The coincident p and <lb/> 7  Be signals resulting from <lb/>breakup in the <lb/> 208  Pb target were identified among the <lb/> K.

Moreover, their <lb/>closest distance to the <lb/> 7  Be trajectory was required to <lb/>lie inside a volume given in x and y by the size of <lb/>the target (±18 mm in x- and ±12 mm in y-direction) <lb/> and having a z-value along the beam axis of ±25 mm <lb/>around the target (located at z = 0). <lb/>The inclusive ΔE spectra resulting from conditions 1 and <lb/>2 above are shown by the thin intermediate line in fig. 3, <lb/>whereas conditions 3 and 4 lead to the full innermost his-<lb/>tograms in fig. 3. This procedure removed all break-up <lb/>events in layers of matter other than the target and led to <lb/>a practically background-free measurement. <lb/> 4.1 Invariant-mass reconstruction <lb/> The p-<lb/> 7  Be relative energy, E  rel  , is derived from the <lb/>total energies, E  i  , of the particles i (i = p, Be), their <lb/>3-momenta, p  i  , and the p-Be opening angle, θ  17  , according <lb/>to <lb/> E  rel  = <lb/> (E  Be  + E  p  )  2  − p  2 <lb/>Be  − p  2 <lb/>p  − 2p  Be  p  p  cos(θ  17  ).

The full innermost <lb/>histograms are obtained by requiring a ΔE-cut on <lb/> 7  Be in each <lb/>SSD plus a p-<lb/> 7  Be vertex inside the target volume (see text). <lb/> Since this affects the efficiency for identifying a break-<lb/>up event for low E  rel  , we have to make sure that the <lb/>GEANT simulation accurately reproduces this efficiency. <lb/>This has been achieved by introducing a weighting func-<lb/>tion in GEANT that gradually increases the efficiency for <lb/>detecting two separated hits from zero to one over the ap-<lb/>propriate distance for each detector so that experimental <lb/>and simulated distance distributions look alike. In fig. 4 <lb/>we plot the inclusive horizontal distances between proton <lb/>and <lb/> 7  Be hits in the first SSD. One can observe that ex-<lb/>periment and simulation yield very similar distributions. <lb/>It should be emphasized that in our earlier data analysis a <lb/>step function of this efficiency was assumed that jumped <lb/>from zero to full efficiency at a fixed distance of 0.4 mm in <lb/>each SSD.

With <lb/> 8  B <lb/>  *  we denote the reference system of the (ex-<lb/>cited) <lb/> 8  B prior to breakup. Its momentum vector is recon-<lb/>structed from the measured proton and <lb/> 7  Be momentum <lb/>vectors. The angle θ  8  is the laboratory scattering angle of <lb/> 8  B <lb/>  *  relative to the incoming <lb/> 8  B beam. The polar angles, <lb/> θ  cm  , and the azimuthal angles, φ  cm  , of the break-up pro-<lb/>tons are measured in the rest frame of the <lb/> 8  B* system. <lb/>In the same way, one can calculate the transverse proton <lb/>momentum vector in the reaction plane (p <lb/> in <lb/>t  ). <lb/>Figure 5 shows the θ  8  distribution, in comparison to <lb/>two-model calculations using first-order PT. The full his-<lb/>togram denoting pure E1 multipolarity follows the data <lb/>points very well, even to very large angles. The dashed <lb/>histogram, where both E1 and E2 with their full the-<lb/>oretical strength were assumed, deviates from the data <lb/>points markedly for θ  8  values above about 0.7 degrees. <lb/>Note that the theoretical histograms were folded with the <lb/>experimental response. We conclude that this distribution <lb/>already indicates E1 dominance. <lb/>We present in fig. 6 the distribution of p <lb/> in <lb/>t  for three <lb/>different upper limits in θ  8  , 0.6 <lb/> •  , 1.0 <lb/> •  , and 2.5 <lb/> •  .

In particular <lb/>for large values of θ  8  , the latter distributions show a strong <lb/>anisotropy around p <lb/> in <lb/>t  = 0 which is absent in our data. <lb/>This is a very sensitive test of E2 admixture and again <lb/>shows no substantial E2 contribution. <lb/> K.

Compared to the results given <lb/>in ref.

The remaining data points remain <lb/>largely unaffected. As a consequence, the slope of our S  17 <lb/> factors as a function of E  rel  becomes smaller and fits much <lb/>better than previously to the energy dependence of De-<lb/>scouvemont&apos;s cluster model [20,21]. <lb/></body>

S17 from this work in comparison with the (p, γ) ex-<lb/>periments of ref. [5] (squares), ref. [8] (stars), and ref. [7] (open <lb/>circles). The latter data were corrected for the contribution of <lb/>the M 1 resonance by the authors. The theoretical curves are <lb/>from Descouvemont [21] and have been fitted to the Seattle <lb/>data (upper curve) and the present data (lower curve), respec-<lb/>tively. See text for more details. <lb/> 5.2 Comparison with direct-capture experiments <lb/> Figure 9 compares our data to those of the recent <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B measurements where the authors have sub-<lb/>tracted the contribution from the M 1 resonance (refs. [5,7, <lb/>8]). With the modifications of the lowest-E  rel  data points <lb/>discussed above, our dataset follows now closely the (p, γ) <lb/> data of Junghans et al. [8] over their entire energy range. <lb/> 5.3 Extrapolation to zero relative energy <lb/> To extrapolate to zero energy, we have chosen the recent <lb/>cluster-model calculation of Descouvemont [21] (we refer <lb/>to this model below as D04). In this refined approach, the <lb/>curve resulting from the Minnesota force (MN) is closer <lb/>to the experimental data and has been used in fig. 9 to fit <lb/>both the Seattle data and our present results over the en-<lb/>ergy range up to E  rel  = 1.5 MeV. The fits yield practically <lb/>identical results within their respective errors. <lb/>Our previous data set [12] was found to be best com-<lb/>patible with the potential-model calculation of Typel as <lb/>discussed in subsect. 2 of the present paper or in Davids <lb/>and Typel [14] (referred to below as DT03). It is obvi-<lb/>ous that with the modified low-energy data points of the <lb/>present paper, the agreement with this model is less sat-<lb/>isfactory. The black dashed curve in fig. 8 visualizes a fit <lb/>of this theory to our data. <lb/>When we fit our lowest 8 data points, up to <lb/> E  rel  = 2 MeV, to the D04 model, we obtain S  17  (0) = <lb/>20.6±0.8 eV b. A systematic error of 5.6% has to be added, <lb/>yielding S  17  (0) = 20.6 ± 0.8(stat) ± 1.2(syst) eV b. Not <lb/>included in these numbers is the theoretical uncertainty <lb/>given by Descouvemont [21] as about 5–10% depending <lb/>on the relative energy. <lb/> 6 Conclusions <lb/> We conclude that at sufficiently high incident energy, a <lb/>high-resolution exclusive CD experiment can provide a <lb/>rather precise value for the low-energy <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B cross <lb/>section. By setting tight constraints to the scattering an-<lb/>gle, θ  8  , and analyzing proton-<lb/> 7  Be angular correlations, a <lb/>significant contribution from E2 multipolarity could be <lb/>excluded. Contrary to our earlier publication [12], our re-<lb/>analyzed results for the astrophysical S  17  factor follow <lb/>closely the energy dependence as predicted by the refined <lb/>cluster-model description of Descouvemont [21]. This find-<lb/>ing is in line with the most recent measurements of the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B reaction. The combined statistical and sys-<lb/>tematic errors of our fit value for S  17  (0) amounts to 6.6%; <lb/>a similar error contribution of about 5% comes from the <lb/>model uncertainty [21]. <lb/> The authors wish to thank K.-H.

The Coulomb dissociation of <lb/> 27  P was studied experimentally using <lb/> 27  P beams at <lb/>57 MeV/nucleon with a lead target. The E2 gamma decay width of the first excited state in <lb/> 27  P was <lb/>determined to be (2.8 ± 0.5) × 10 <lb/> −5  eV. The total (M 1 + E2) gamma decay width of the state, which is of <lb/>astrophysical interest, is estimated by combining the experimental result and a shell model calculation. The <lb/>reaction rate of <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P is deduced from the estimated total gamma decay width. The astrophysical <lb/>implication derived from estimated gamma decay width is discussed. <lb/> PACS. 25.60.-t Reaction induced by unstable nuclei – 25.70.De Coulomb excitation – 26.30.+k Nucle-<lb/>osynthesis in novae, supernovae and other explosive environments – 27.30.+t 20 ≤ A ≤ 38 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The mapping of the isotope <lb/> 26  Al in the interstellar <lb/>medium through the detection of its 1.809 MeV γ line by <lb/>satellites [1] has increased the interest in <lb/> 26  Al nucleosyn-<lb/>thesis. This is a trace of ongoing nucleosynthesis in the <lb/>universe because lifetime of <lb/> 26  Al (10 <lb/> 6  yr) is much shorter <lb/>than the timescale of the cosmic evolution. Consequently, <lb/>the nuclear physics of the isotopes around <lb/> 26  Al is of im-<lb/>portance. <lb/>The <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P reaction is relevant to the synthe-<lb/>sis of <lb/> 26  Al. The nuclide <lb/> 26  Si β decays to the isomeric <lb/>state of <lb/> 26  Al which subsequently β decays to the ground <lb/>state of <lb/> 26  Mg, thus no γ-ray is emitted. The characteristic <lb/>1.809 MeV γ line is only emitted by the β decay of <lb/> 26  Al in <lb/>the ground state. Therefore, the synthesis of <lb/> 26  Si was not <lb/>thought to contribute the γ-ray emission of <lb/> 26  Al. Recently, <lb/>it has been suggested that high temperature environment <lb/> a  e-mail: toga@ne.rikkyo.ac.jp <lb/> with T  9  ≥ 0.4 is hot enough to establish an equilibrium be-<lb/>tween the isomeric state and the ground state in <lb/> 26  Al [2]. <lb/>Therefore, <lb/> 26  Si destruction by proton capture is impor-<lb/>tant to determine the amount of the ground state in <lb/> 26  Al <lb/>produced by the equilibrium. <lb/>Under this high temperature the capture reaction rate, <lb/> N  A  σv, is expected to be dominated by the resonant cap-<lb/>ture via the first excited state in <lb/> 27  P [3]. Resonant capture <lb/>rates for isolated, narrow resonances are given by <lb/> N  A  σv = 1.54 × 10 <lb/> 11  (μT  9  ) <lb/> −3/2  ωγ exp <lb/> −11.605 <lb/> E  R <lb/> T  9 <lb/> (1) <lb/>with N  A  Avogadro&apos;s number, μ the reduced mass in amu, <lb/> T  9  the temperature in unit of GK, σv the thermally av-<lb/>eraged nuclear cross section, and E  R  the resonance energy <lb/>in MeV [4]. The resonance strength ωγ is given by <lb/> ωγ = <lb/>2J + 1 <lb/>(2J  p  + 1)(2J  T  + 1) <lb/> Γ  p  Γ  γ <lb/> Γ  tot <lb/> , <lb/> (2) <lb/></body>

The entire system is in vacuum. <lb/> where J is the spin of the compound nucleus, and J  p  and <lb/> J  T  are the spins of the proton and target, respectively. <lb/> Γ  p  and Γ  γ  are the proton widths and the gamma decay <lb/>widths of the resonance. The total width Γ  tot  is the sum <lb/>of the partial widths. <lb/>A direct measurement of the relevant capture cross sec-<lb/>tion is the preferable method for determining the proton <lb/>capture reaction rates. However, the cross section becomes <lb/>quite small at stellar energies due to the Coulomb bar-<lb/>rier and radioactive beams of sufficient intensities are not <lb/>available. Therefore, indirect methods must be employed <lb/>to extract the information about the reaction rate. <lb/>The Coulomb dissociation at intermediate energies is <lb/>an alternative method to study the radioactive capture <lb/>reactions of astrophysical interest at low energies [5,6,7]. <lb/>The process can be regarded as photodisintegration by <lb/>virtual photons, which is essentially the inverse of the ra-<lb/>diative capture process [8]. The extracted electromagnetic <lb/>transition probability is directly determines the Γ  γ  . The <lb/>Coulomb breakup process is characterized by a large cross <lb/>section which helps to compensate for the small capture <lb/>cross section. <lb/>The present paper reports on an experimental study <lb/>of the dissociation of <lb/> 27  P in the Coulomb field of a Pb nu-<lb/>cleus. The Γ  γ  values of the first excited state in <lb/> 27  P, which <lb/>have the largest contribution to the resonant capture rate <lb/>of <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P, has been extracted. <lb/> 2 Experiment <lb/> The experiment was performed at the RIKEN Accelera-<lb/>tor Research Facility. A <lb/> 27  P beam was produced via the <lb/>projectile fragmentation of a 115-A-MeV <lb/> 36  Ar beam in-<lb/>cident on a 460 mg/cm <lb/> 2  thick Be target, and separated <lb/>by the RIKEN Projectile-fragment Separator (RIPS) [9]. <lb/>The typical <lb/> 27  P intensity was about 2800 counts per sec-<lb/>ond and the energy was 57 A MeV with an energy spread <lb/>of about 1.5%. It bombarded a 125 mg/cm <lb/> 2  thick lead <lb/>target. The isotopic purity of <lb/> 27  P in the secondary beam <lb/>is about 1%. The major contributions are <lb/> 26  Si, <lb/> 25  Al, and <lb/> 24  Mg. The particle identification for secondary beams was <lb/>performed event by event by means of the time-of-flight <lb/>(TOF)-ΔE method using a 0.5 mm thick plastic scintil-<lb/>lator located at the second focal plane of the RIPS. Two <lb/>sets of parallel plate avalanche counters were also placed <lb/>at the final focal plane of the RIPS to extrapolate the <lb/>position and angle of the beam at the target. <lb/>The isotope <lb/> 27  P were excited by the lead target and <lb/>disintegrated to <lb/> 26  Si and proton. Figure 1 shows the de-<lb/>tector system for the measurement of breakup products. <lb/>The emission angles of these products were measured at a <lb/>position-sensitive silicon telescope located at 48 cm down-<lb/>stream of the target. The silicon telescope consists of four <lb/>layers of detectors with 0.5 mm thickness. Each layer was <lb/>of eight silicon detectors with 50 × 50 mm <lb/> 2  effective ar-<lb/>eas on 56 × 56 mm <lb/> 2  frames. The eight detectors in a layer <lb/>formed a 3 × 3 matrix with a hole in the center. The count <lb/>rate in the telescope was suppressed to 3000 counts per <lb/>second by introducing the hole whereas the total beam <lb/>rate was about 3 × 10 <lb/> 5  count per second. The detectors <lb/>in the first and second layers have 5 mm wide strip elec-<lb/>trodes, which enables to measure the hit positions of the <lb/>products. The energy of the <lb/> 26  Si was also measured by the <lb/>silicon telescope. <lb/> 26  Si was stopped at the fourth layer, and <lb/>identified using the ΔE-E method. <lb/> Y.

Relative energy spectrum of the <lb/> 27  P breakup on Pb <lb/>(full circle). The data was fitted by the detector responses sim-<lb/>ulated using Geant4 code [10]. The dashed curves and solid <lb/>curve represent the components and sum of the elements. <lb/> The energy of the proton, which penetrated the silicon <lb/>telescope, was determined with a plastic scintillator ho-<lb/>doscope placed at the 2.8 m downstream of the target by <lb/>measuring the TOF. The hodoscope with an active area of <lb/>1 × 1 m <lb/> 2  , consists of thirteen 5 mm thick ΔE- and sixteen <lb/>60 mm thick E-plastic scintillators. The outgoing proton <lb/>was stopped in the E counters after passing through the <lb/> ΔE counters. The proton was identified by the TOF-ΔE <lb/>and TOF-E methods. <lb/>The relative energy E  rel  between <lb/> 26  Si and proton was <lb/>extracted by combining the positions and energies of the <lb/>products. The energy E  rel  corresponds to the center-of-<lb/>mass energy, and thus the excitation energy of <lb/> 27  P E  x <lb/> can be expressed as <lb/> E  x  = E  rel  + E  s  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where E  s  represents the separation energy for the decay <lb/>channel (0.859 MeV for <lb/> 27  P). Therefore, by measuring the <lb/> E  rel  the excitation energy E  x  can be determined. <lb/> 3 Result and discussion <lb/> The relative energy spectrum is shown in fig. 2. The full <lb/>circles represent the experimental data. The solid curve <lb/>represents the best fit with five contributions shown by <lb/>the dashed curves. The detector responses were simulated <lb/>by the GEANT4 code [10]. The peak at 0.31 MeV corre-<lb/>sponds to the known first excited state at 1.2 MeV in <lb/> 27  P. <lb/>The bump at around 1 MeV may be respectively due to the <lb/>known second excited state at 1.6 MeV and an unknown <lb/>one at 2.0 MeV. The peak at 2.2 MeV corresponds to the <lb/>known state at 3.4 MeV. The direct breakup component, <lb/>which distributes from 0.8 MeV to 4.5 MeV, corresponds <lb/>to the non-resonant proton capture process. The cross sec-<lb/>tion σ is related to the astrophysical S-factor <lb/>S = σE exp (2πη) , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where η denotes the Sommerfeld parameter. We assume <lb/>that the non-resonant capture is dominated by the E1 <lb/> Fig. 3. The reaction rate of <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P as a function of <lb/>the temperature of stars.

[3]. <lb/> transition and the astrophysical S-factor is independent <lb/>of the energies. <lb/>The Coulomb dissociation cross section for the first ex-<lb/>cited state in <lb/> 27  P was determined to be 14.8± 2.7 mb from <lb/>the yield of the peak. The error includes the statistical one <lb/>and ambiguity of the detection efficiency. Supposing the <lb/>spin and parity of the state is 3/2 <lb/> +  from the level scheme <lb/>of the mirror nucleus <lb/> 27  Mg [11], the transition between <lb/>the first excited state and ground state (1/2 <lb/> +  ) is induced <lb/>by the M 1 and E2 multipolarities. This means that the <lb/> Γ  γ  is a sum of a E2 component (Γ  γ  (E2)) and an M 1 <lb/>component (Γ  γ  (M 1)). Since the Coulomb dissociation is <lb/>highly sensitive to the E2 component compared with the <lb/> M 1 transition [12], the experimental cross section is ex-<lb/>pected to be exhausted by the E2 excitation. Γ  γ  (E2) is <lb/>determined to be (2.8 ± 0.5) × 10 <lb/> −5  eV form the measured <lb/>cross section. <lb/>To deduce the Γ  γ  (M 1), the E2/M 1 mixing ratio δ of <lb/>the first excited state in <lb/> 27  P was estimated by the combi-<lb/>nation of the known mixing ratio [13] of the mirror nucleus <lb/> 27  Mg and the double ratio R defined as R = δ  TZ +  /δ  TZ −  , <lb/>where δ  TZ +  and δ  TZ −  represent the mixing ratios of the <lb/>mirror pair. To estimate the ratio R, we performed shell <lb/>model calculations using the USD effective interaction [14] <lb/>with conventional values of the effective charges in the sd-<lb/> shell region, e  p  = 1.3e and e  n  = 0.5e [15]. The reliability <lb/>of the R calculated by the shell model was evaluated to <lb/>be 60% (2σ) by comparing with the experimentally known <lb/>values. From the calculated R and the known δ of <lb/> 27  Mg, <lb/>the mixing ratio for <lb/> 27  P was estimated to be 0.020±0.012. <lb/>The Γ  γ  (M 1) was derived from the mixing ratio and thus <lb/>the total Γ  γ  estimated to be (3.7 ± 2.2) × 10 <lb/> −3  eV. The <lb/>error includes the experimental error and ambiguity come <lb/>from the estimation of M 1 contribution. This value is con-<lb/>sistent with the previous estimation [3]. <lb/>The reaction rate of the <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P was calculated <lb/>using the extracted Γ  γ  value.

Temperature-density boundary (solid line) at which the <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P reaction and the competing β decay are of equal <lb/>strength assuming a hydrogen mass fraction XH = 0.5. Dot-<lb/>dashed curves represent the range of error. The dashed curves <lb/>and dotted line indicate T -ρ profiles of two novae sequences <lb/>and an X-ray burst, respectively. <lb/> parameters are taken from ref. [3] except for Γ  γ  .

The dashed line denotes <lb/>the direct capture component of reaction rate calculated <lb/>by J.A. Caggiano et al. [3] based on a shell model. This <lb/>figure indicates that the resonant capture is the dominant <lb/>process above 0.1 GK, the temperature region of novae <lb/>and X-ray bursts temperature [16]. <lb/>The competition between <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P reaction and <lb/> 26  Si β decay can be discussed by using the extracted reac-<lb/>tion rate. The competition depends on the density, tem-<lb/>perature, and mass fraction of proton in stars. The solid <lb/>line in fig. 4 represents the temperature and density con-<lb/>dition for which (p, γ) reaction and the competing β decay <lb/>are of equal strength. The dot-dashed lines show the error <lb/>of the present estimate. The solid curve was calculated us-<lb/>ing our result and assuming a hydrogen mass fraction of <lb/> X  H  = 0.5. In the region above the solid curve the proton <lb/>capture reaction dominates, while below the solid line the <lb/>nuclei <lb/> 26  Si are exhausted by β decay. The dashed lines <lb/>denote temperature-density profiles for the two novae se-<lb/>quences, whose masses are 1.25 M   and 1.35 M   [17,18], <lb/>and the dotted line shows one for an X-ray burst [19] of a <lb/>1.4 M   neutron star. The novae sequence evolves in time <lb/>from larger to smaller densities, on the other hand the <lb/>one for X-ray burst evolves from smaller to larger densi-<lb/>ties. It can be seen that the (p, γ) reaction dominates in <lb/>the heavy novae when they are at around the peak tem-<lb/>perature, whereas the reaction hardly occurs in the light <lb/>novae. On the other hand, the X-ray burst is dominated <lb/>by the (p, γ) reaction in their all phases. <lb/> 4 Summary <lb/> The Coulomb dissociation of <lb/> 27  P was experimentally stud-<lb/>ied to investigate the <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P reaction in explosive <lb/>hydrogen burning in novae and X-ray bursts. The first <lb/>excites state in <lb/> 27  P, which has the largest contribution <lb/>among the resonances of <lb/> 27  P to the reaction rate, was ob-<lb/>served by measuring the relative energy between <lb/> 26  Si and <lb/>proton. <lb/>The E2 component of Γ  γ  for first excited state was <lb/>experimentally determined to be (2.8 ± 0.5) × 10 <lb/> −5  eV. We <lb/>estimated the total Γ  γ  to be (1.3 ± 0.8) × 10 <lb/> −3  eV by the <lb/>measured E2 component together with the E2/M 1 mixing <lb/>ratio estimated by the one for the mirror nuclei <lb/> 27  Mg with <lb/>the help of a shell model calculation. This is consistent <lb/>with the previously estimated value by J.A. Caggiano et <lb/>al. [3]. The present result indicates non-negligible effects of <lb/>the <lb/> 26  Si(p, γ) <lb/> 27  P reaction to the nuclear burning in heavy <lb/>novae and X-ray bursts. <lb/>Analysis for higher excited states, which may affect the <lb/>reaction rate at high temperature, is in progress. <lb/> We thank the staff of RIKEN accelerator for their excellent <lb/>operation of the beam delivery.

We discuss the use of one-nucleon breakup reactions of loosely bound nuclei at intermediate <lb/>energies as an indirect method in nuclear astrophysics. These are peripheral processes, therefore we can <lb/>extract asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANC) from which reaction rates of astrophysical interest can <lb/>be inferred. To show the usefulness of the method, three different cases are discussed. In the first, existing <lb/>experimental data for the breakup of <lb/> 8  B at energies from 30 to 1000 MeV/u and of <lb/> 9  C at 285 MeV/u on <lb/>light through heavy targets are analyzed. Glauber model calculations in the eikonal approximation and <lb/>in the optical limit using different effective interactions give consistent, though slightly different results, <lb/>showing the limits of the precision of the method. The results lead to the astrophysical factor S  17(0)  = <lb/>18.7 ± 1.9 eV · b for the key reaction for solar neutrino production <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B. It is consistent with the <lb/>values from other indirect methods and most direct measurements, but one. Breakup reactions can be <lb/>measured with radioactive beams as weak as a few particles per second, and therefore can be used for <lb/>cases where no direct measurements or other indirect methods for nuclear astrophysics can be applied. <lb/>We discuss a proposed use of the breakup of the proton drip line nucleus <lb/> 23  Al to obtain spectroscopic <lb/>information and the stellar reaction rate for <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al. <lb/> PACS. 25.60.-t Reactions induced by unstable nuclei – 25.60.Gc Breakup and momentum distributions – <lb/>26.65.+t Solar neutrinos – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and other explosive environ-<lb/>ments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Radiative proton capture reactions are important in nu-<lb/>clear astrophysics, and a large number of reaction chains <lb/>were found to be needed in nucleosynthesis calculations <lb/>for static or explosive hydrogen burning scenarios (see <lb/> e.g. [1,2]). This means that more data involving proton <lb/>capture on unstable nuclei are necessary. In some cases <lb/>direct experiments are possible, but in many more they <lb/>are impossible with the present techniques and even with <lb/>those of the foreseeable future. We have to rely on indirect <lb/>methods instead. In this presentation we discuss such an <lb/>indirect method, and we shall concentrate on three par-<lb/>ticular cases, first to demonstrate the feasibility, then to <lb/>show the strengths of the method and its limits. <lb/>Part of the results discussed were published before, <lb/>when we originally proposed to extract astrophysical S-<lb/> factors from one-nucleon-removal (or breakup) reactions <lb/>of loosely bound nuclei at intermediate energies or later [3, <lb/>4,5]. In the present paper, first we use the well stud-<lb/>ied case of <lb/> 8  B breakup as a benchmark to demonstrate <lb/>the usefulness of the method and show the possibili-<lb/> a  e-mail: livius trache@tamu.edu <lb/> ties of the Glauber reaction model used. We show that <lb/>existing experimental data at energies between 30 and <lb/>1000 MeV/nucleon [6,7,8,9,10] on a range of light and <lb/>heavy targets translate into consistent values of the ANC, <lb/>which is then used to determine the astrophysical factor <lb/> S  17  (which gives the reaction rate for the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B re-<lb/>action of crucial importance for the solar neutrino ques-<lb/>tion). We show that the precision of the method is limited <lb/>to about 10% by our ability to compute absolute cross sec-<lb/>tions. Second, we use the same technique for <lb/> 9  C breakup <lb/>data at 285 MeV/nucleon [7] to determine S  18  (which gives <lb/>the rate for the <lb/> 8  B(p, γ) <lb/> 9  C reaction of importance for ex-<lb/>plosive hydrogen burning) with reasonable accuracy. For a <lb/>third case, a proposed experiment for the breakup of <lb/> 23  Al <lb/>is discussed to show that the method is particularly well <lb/>adapted to rare isotope beams produced using fragmenta-<lb/>tion. Spectroscopic information is sought in this case. In <lb/>particular we seek to determine the spin and parity of the <lb/>ground state of the dripline nucleus <lb/> 23  Al and the ANC, <lb/>which will be then used to calculate the reaction rates for <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al. The last part of the present paper will <lb/>concentrate on this latter case, which has not been dis-<lb/>cussed before. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2 The reaction model <lb/> The method is based on data showing that the structure <lb/>of halo nuclei is dominated by one or two nucleons orbit-<lb/>ing a core [11,12]. Consequently, we use the fact that the <lb/>breakup of halo or loosely bound nuclei is essentially a pe-<lb/>ripheral process, and therefore, the breakup cross-sections <lb/>can give information about the wave function of the last <lb/>nucleon at large distances from the core. More precisely, <lb/>asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) can be de-<lb/>termined. We show that there exists a favorable kinemat-<lb/>ical window in which breakup reactions are highly periph-<lb/>eral and are dominated by the external part of the wave <lb/>function and, therefore, the ANC is the better quantity <lb/>to be extracted. The approach offers an alternative and <lb/>complementary technique to extracting ANCs from trans-<lb/>fer reactions [13]. <lb/>In the breakup of loosely bound nuclei at intermedi-<lb/>ate energies, a nucleus B = (Ap), where B is a bound <lb/>state of the core A and the nucleon p, is produced by <lb/>fragmentation from a primary beam, separated and then <lb/>used to bombard a secondary target. In measurements, <lb/>the core A is detected, measuring its parallel and trans-<lb/>verse momenta and eventually the gamma-rays emitted <lb/>from its de-excitation. Spectroscopic information can be <lb/>extracted from these experiments, such as the orbital mo-<lb/>mentum of the relative motion of the nucleon and the con-<lb/>tribution of different core states, typically comparing the <lb/>measured momentum distributions with those calculated <lb/>with Glauber models. The integrated cross sections can be <lb/>used to extract absolute spectroscopic factors [12] or the <lb/>ANC [3]. The latter approach has the advantage that it is <lb/>independent of the geometry of the proton binding poten-<lb/>tial. We note that the ANC C <lb/> B <lb/> Ap  for the nuclear system <lb/> A + p ↔ B specifies the amplitude of the tail of the over-<lb/>lap function of the bound state B in the two-body chan-<lb/>nel (A p) (see, for example [13] and references therein). <lb/>Fortunately, this ANC is all we need to determine the as-<lb/>trophysical S-factor for the radiative proton capture reac-<lb/>tion A(p, γ)B which is a highly peripheral process. Details <lb/>about the reaction model are published elsewhere [5,14]. <lb/> 3 Three particular cases <lb/> 3.1 Breakup of <lb/> 8 B to determine the S 17 astrophysical <lb/>factor <lb/> The calculations presented in [3] have been extended and <lb/>refined. The Coulomb part of the dissociation cross sec-<lb/>tion was refined by including the final state interaction <lb/>into calculations and new data on the breakup of <lb/> 8  B are <lb/>analyzed [8,9,10]. Also a new set of calculations for the <lb/>breakup of <lb/> 8  B were made using five sets of different ef-<lb/>fective NN interactions. We describe the breakup of <lb/> 8  B <lb/>(and in the next subsection of <lb/> 9  C) in terms of an extended <lb/>Glauber model. The loosely bound <lb/> 8  B ( <lb/> 9  C) nucleus is mov-<lb/>ing on a straight line trajectory and the proton and the <lb/> 7  Be ( <lb/> 8  B) core making it, interact independently with the <lb/>target. The breakup cross sections depend on the proton-<lb/>target and core-target interactions and on the relative p-<lb/> core motion. The wave function of the ground state of <lb/> 8  B <lb/>( <lb/> 9  C) is a mixture of 1p  3/2  and 1p  1/2  orbitals, around a <lb/> 7  Be ( <lb/> 8  B) core. The total ANC C <lb/> 2 <lb/> tot  = C <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  3/2 <lb/> + C <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  1/2 <lb/> can <lb/>be extracted from the measured breakup cross sections. <lb/>The calculations reproduce well all the measured par-<lb/>allel and transverse momentum distributions measured so <lb/>far, on light or heavy targets, giving us confidence in the <lb/>Glauber model used. We show that the reaction is periph-<lb/>eral in various degrees, depending on the energy and target <lb/>used. The <lb/> 8  B ANC is extracted from existing breakup data <lb/>at energies between 30-1000 MeV/nucleon and on differ-<lb/>ent targets ranging from C to Pb [6,7,8,9,10]. Two ap-<lb/>proaches were used. The first is a potential approach. To <lb/>obtain the folded potentials needed in the S-matrix cal-<lb/>culations we used the JLM effective nucleon-nucleon in-<lb/>teraction [15], using the procedure and the renormaliza-<lb/>tions of ref. [16]. We applied this technique for energies <lb/>below 285 MeV/nucleon only and on all targets. In a sec-<lb/>ond approach, the Glauber model in the optical limit was <lb/>used. The breakup process is treated as multiple elemen-<lb/>tary interactions between partners&apos; nucleons, and the cross <lb/>sections and the complex scattering amplitudes are taken <lb/>from the literature. Calculations were done using different <lb/>ranges for the elementary interactions: zero range, 1.5 fm <lb/>( &quot; standard &quot; ), 2.5 fm and individual ranges for each NN <lb/>component ( &quot; Ray &quot; ) [17]. No new parameters were ad-<lb/>justed. The contribution of the <lb/> 7  Be core excitation was <lb/>calculated for each target and at each energy using the <lb/>data from an experiment which disentangle it [10], and <lb/>corrected for in all cases. For details on the procedure <lb/>see [5]. In fig. 1 we show that from the widely varying <lb/>breakup cross sections (panel a)) on all targets and at so <lb/>different energies, we extract ANCs which are consistent <lb/>with a constant value (panel b)). However, we see that <lb/>a certain dependence on the NN interaction used exists, <lb/>which points to the limitations of our present knowledge <lb/>of the effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. <lb/>If we take the unweighted average of all 31 determina-<lb/>tions we find an ANC C <lb/> 2 <lb/> tot  (JLM) = 0.483 ± 0.050 fm <lb/> −1 <lb/> (fig. 1). The value is in agreement with that deter-<lb/>mined using the ( <lb/> 7  Be, <lb/> 8  B) proton transfer reactions at <lb/>12 MeV/u [18,19]. The two values agree well, in spite of <lb/>the differences in the energy ranges and in the reaction <lb/>mechanisms involved. The ANC extracted leads to the as-<lb/>trophysical factor S  17  (0) = 18.7 ± 1.9 eV · b for the key <lb/>reaction for solar neutrino production <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B. The <lb/>uncertainties quoted are only the standard deviation of <lb/>the individual values around the average, involving there-<lb/>fore the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. This <lb/>10% error bar is probably a good measure of the precision <lb/>we can claim from the method at this point in time, due <lb/>essentially to the uncertainties in the cross section calcu-<lb/>lations. The S  17  (0) value we extract is also in agreement <lb/>with those extracted from indirect methods and with most <lb/>of the direct determinations (see the discussions in [20,21, <lb/>22]), but one which stands out in its claim of a larger <lb/>value and very small error [23]. There are currently many <lb/></body>

The dashed, dotted and <lb/>dash-dotted lines are the averages of the three interactions <lb/>above, in that order. List of experiments in ref. [5]. <lb/> evaluations of existing or new data and variations occur in <lb/>the central values and uncertainties of the determinations. <lb/>It is difficult to quote all of them and is not our intention <lb/>to do so here. However, we notice that our average value <lb/>of S  17  (0) is very close to the &quot; low &quot; values obtained from <lb/>Coulomb dissociation data and some direct data S  17  (0) = <lb/>18.6 ± 0.4(exp)±1.1(syst) eV · b [21]. It is also in reason-<lb/>able agreement with the average value obtained by Cyburt <lb/> et al. [24] S  17  (0) = 20.8 ± 0.6(stat)±1.0(syst) eV · b using <lb/>all radiative capture data in the assumption they are com-<lb/>pletely independent. The difference between our value and <lb/>the value obtained from the direct measurement of Jung-<lb/>hans et al. [23] S  17  (0) = 22.1 ± 0.6(stat)±0.6(theor) eV · b <lb/>still exists and is only relevant if the small uncertainty of <lb/>the latter is true, given the fact that it involves extrapola-<lb/>tion. It would, of course, be interesting to understand why <lb/>the results differ. The difficulties encountered by the direct <lb/>methods, both experimental (very small cross sections, dif-<lb/>ficult targets, etc...) and theoretical (extrapolations), are <lb/>known (see, e.g., ref. [25]). One important factor in any in-<lb/>direct determination of the astrophysical S-factor is that <lb/>of the accuracy of the theoretical calculations involved. <lb/>Much effort is done currently, e.g., to investigate the ac-<lb/>curacy of the absolute values of the calculations used in <lb/>the analysis of the Coulomb dissociation experiments [26, <lb/>27]. We did our part above, using different NN interac-<lb/>tions. Our central value is about 1σ lower than the aver-<lb/>age central value obtained by Cyburt et al. [24] in a recent <lb/>analysis that uses all of the best available capture data, <lb/>under the assumption that they are independent. Includ-<lb/>ing the uncertainty quoted by Cyburt et al. our results are <lb/>consistent at the 1σ level. <lb/> 3.2 Breakup of <lb/> 9 C to determine S 18 <lb/> The same procedures have been applied for <lb/> 9  C to de-<lb/>termine the astrophysical S  18  factor for the reaction <lb/> 8  B(p, γ) <lb/> 9  C. The reaction is important in hot pp-chains <lb/> as it can provide a starting point for an alternative path <lb/>across the A = 8 mass gap [2]. The ANC for <lb/> 9  C → <lb/> 8  B + p, <lb/> has been determined using existing experimental data for <lb/>the breakup of <lb/> 9  C projectiles at 285 MeV/u on four dif-<lb/>ferent targets: C, Al, Sn and Pb [7]. No experimental data <lb/>are available here for momentum distributions. The in-<lb/>troduction of the final state interaction in the Coulomb <lb/>dissociation part does not change the result by much, <lb/>compared with our previous analysis [4]. We find now <lb/> C <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  3/2 <lb/> + C <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  1/2 <lb/> = 1.26 ± 0.13 fm <lb/> −1  . To calculate the as-<lb/>trophysical S-factor we use the potential model. We find <lb/> S  18  (0) = 47 ± 6 eV · b. A very weak dependence on energy <lb/>is observed: S(E) = 47.3 − 15.1E + 7.34E <lb/> 2  (E in MeV). <lb/>This result is in very good agreement with other determi-<lb/>nations [28,8], but not with one from Coulomb dissocia-<lb/>tion [29], a fact that we do not understand. We underline <lb/>that for this case the precision achieved from this determi-<lb/>nation is the best so far and is sufficient for astrophysical <lb/>purposes. <lb/> 3.3 Breakup of <lb/> 23 Al and the consequences on the <lb/> 22 Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23 Al stellar reaction rate <lb/> Space-based gamma-ray telescopes have the ability to de-<lb/>tect γ-rays of cosmic origin.

Measurements, however, have not de-<lb/>tected the 1.275 MeV gamma-ray following the decay of <lb/> 22  Na and have only been able to set an upper limit on <lb/>its production, a limit which is below the theoretical pre-<lb/>dictions (see, for example, [33,34] and references therein). <lb/>This discrepancy may arise from a poor knowledge of the <lb/>reaction cross sections employed in the network calcula-<lb/>tions for the rp-process. In particular, it was proposed that <lb/>the precursor <lb/> 22  Mg can be depleted by the radiative pro-<lb/>ton capture reaction <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al [35], which can result <lb/>in a serious reduction of the <lb/> 22  Na abundance. The reac-<lb/>tion is dominated by direct capture and resonant capture <lb/>through the first excited state in <lb/> 23  Al. There is no direct <lb/>measurement of the cross section at stellar energies be-<lb/>cause it is impossible to make a <lb/> 22  Mg (T  1/2  = 3.86 s) tar-<lb/>get and difficult to obtain an intense <lb/> 22  Mg beam. There-<lb/>fore, currently the rate of this reaction is estimated based <lb/>on the mass and resonance energy determined experimen-<lb/>tally [36] and assuming that the spins and parities are as <lb/>in the mirror system <lb/> 23  Ne. <lb/>The nucleus <lb/> 23  Al is a weakly bound proton-rich nu-<lb/>cleus (S  p  = 0.123(19) MeV) close to the drip line. Recent <lb/>measurements of the reaction cross sections for N = 10 <lb/>isotones and Z = 13 isotopes around 30 MeV/nucleon on <lb/>a <lb/> 12  C target found a remarkable enhancement for <lb/> 23  Al, <lb/>which led the authors to the conclusion that it is one of <lb/>the rare proton halo nuclei [37]. This is explained with a <lb/>presumed level inversion between the 2s  1/2  and 1d  5/2  or-<lb/>bitals (fig. 2). The inversion was further supported by sev-<lb/>eral microscopic nuclear structure calculations that find <lb/> J <lb/> π  = 1/2 <lb/> +  for the <lb/> 23  Al ground state [38]. If the above-<lb/>mentioned inversion is correct, it will affect the radiative <lb/>capture cross section much more strongly than any other <lb/>uncertainties. Indeed, assuming such an inversion, we re-<lb/>calculate the astrophysical S-factor (fig. 3a) and the stellar <lb/>reaction rate (fig. 3b) for the <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al reaction and <lb/>find an increase of 30 to 50 times over the current esti-<lb/>mate of the rate for the temperature range T  9  = 0.1 − 0.3. <lb/>Clearly then, it is important to determine the spin and <lb/>parity of the low-lying levels in <lb/> 23  Al. It is important for <lb/>both nuclear structure and for its consequences for nuclear <lb/>astrophysics. As a further complication, the NNDC data <lb/>base gives J <lb/> π  = 3/2 <lb/> +  for the ground state of <lb/> 23  Al [39]. <lb/> 0 <lb/> 5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/> E p (MeV) <lb/>S-factor (keV b) <lb/> a) <lb/>T 9 (10 <lb/> 9 K) <lb/>React rate (cm <lb/> 3 <lb/> /mole/s) <lb/> b) <lb/> 10 <lb/> -20 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -16 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -12 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -8 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -4 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 4 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -2 <lb/> 10 <lb/> -1 <lb/> 1 <lb/>10 <lb/> 0 <lb/> Fig. 3. a) The astrophysical S-factor for the <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al <lb/>reaction, calculated assuming J <lb/> π  = 5/2 <lb/> +  (dashed line), or <lb/> J <lb/> π  = 1/2 <lb/> +  (orbital inversion, full line) for the g.s. of <lb/> 23  Al. <lb/>b) The corresponding reaction rate calculated for the case <lb/>of non-inversion (dashed), or inversion (full line).

Such <lb/>reactions have proven to be a reliable spectroscopic tool, <lb/>with advantages in particular for the case of weakly bound <lb/>isotopes, close to the drip lines [12,14].

The full lines are the sum of all contributions. <lb/>They were all calculated assuming pure 1d  5/2  or 2s  1/2  orbitals, respectively. <lb/> been performed with procedures similar to those used pre-<lb/>viously [3,14]. The first step is the calculation of the single-<lb/>particle density in <lb/> 22  Mg using a spherical HF+BCS cal-<lb/>culation with the density energy functional of Beiner and <lb/>Lombard [40]. The experimental proton separation energy <lb/>in <lb/> 23  Al, S  p  = 0.123 MeV, was reproduced. There are two <lb/>possibilities for the spin-parity of the ground state: J <lb/> π  = <lb/>5/2 <lb/> +  or 1/2 <lb/> +  . Glauber model calculations have therefore <lb/>been performed for each case, assuming pure 1d  5/2  , or <lb/>2s  1/2  orbitals, in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of <lb/>the technique.

For example the cross section drops by a <lb/>factor of two if a 1d  5/2  state is assumed rather than 2s  1/2  . <lb/>This is easy to understand because the low-binding en-<lb/>ergy and the lack of a centrifugal barrier in the case of a <lb/>2s  1/2  orbital leads to a much longer tail of the radial wave <lb/>function than for the case of the 1d  5/2  orbital. Moreover, <lb/>the very peripheral character of single-nucleon removal re-<lb/>actions means that it is the asymptotic part of the wave <lb/></body>

			<body> function that dictates the cross section and momentum <lb/>distribution. In the case of the latter, the widths of the <lb/>momentum distributions differ by a factor of two for both <lb/>the parallel and transverse momenta, reflecting the dif-<lb/>ferent behavior of the tails of the wave functions. Cross <lb/>sections of 97 mb (2s  1/2  ), and of 42 mb (1d  5/2  ) were found <lb/>for the two ground-state spin-parity assignments. The cor-<lb/>responding widths (FWHM) of the distributions are pre-<lb/>dicted to be 60 MeV/c, and 180 MeV/c, respectively. <lb/>2) The shape of momentum distributions is extremely <lb/>selective —narrow for a 2s  1/2  state and broad with a flat <lb/>top and a small central dip for removal of a 1d  5/2  (fig. 4). <lb/>A study of one-proton removal from <lb/> 23  Al should, there-<lb/>fore, allow the spin-parity of the ground state of <lb/> 23  Al <lb/>to be deduced. Measurements of the cross sections and <lb/>momentum distributions in coincidence with gamma-rays <lb/>from the <lb/> 22  Mg core will allow us to disentangle the de-<lb/>tailed structure of the wave function, and in particular <lb/>to deduce the spectroscopic factors for the various con-<lb/>figurations. This spectroscopic information will also be <lb/>valuable to determine if <lb/> 23  Al is deformed or spherical. <lb/>Currently experimental studies of Coulomb dissociation of <lb/> 23  Al are carried out at RIKEN to determine the gamma-<lb/>ray width of its first excited state. The results in ref. [41] <lb/> Γ  γ  = 7.2 ± 1.4 · 10 <lb/> −7  eV agree with the value estimated by <lb/>us using single-particle wave functions for the E2 transi-<lb/>tion: Γ  γ  = 6 · 10 <lb/> −7  eV and used in the present calculation <lb/>of the resonant term (shown in fig. 3b) for the capture <lb/>reaction rate <lb/> 22  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 23  Al. <lb/> 4 Conclusions <lb/> In conclusion, we have shown that one-proton-removal re-<lb/>actions at intermediate energies can be used to obtain as-<lb/>trophysical S-factors at stellar energies for radiative pro-<lb/>ton capture reactions. Difficult or impossible direct mea-<lb/>surements for nuclear astrophysics at very low energies <lb/>can be replaced by indirect measurements with radioac-<lb/>tive beams at larger energies. We find that a kinematic <lb/>window exists at 30–150 MeV/nucleon where the reactions <lb/>are peripheral and the relevant ANC can be determined. <lb/>The method is particularly useful because it can be used <lb/>for rare isotopes, for poor-quality radioactive beams ob-<lb/>tained from fragmentation, with cocktail beams and with <lb/>low intensity beams. It was shown that breakup at inter-<lb/>mediate energies can be studied with beams as low as a <lb/>few particles/s [42]. Our results from the use of different <lb/>NN interactions remind us of the fact that the precision <lb/>of all indirect methods depends not only on the precision <lb/>of the experiments but also on the accuracy of the calcu-<lb/>lations. Our findings may give a measure of the present <lb/>status of accuracy. <lb/> This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of <lb/>Energy under Grant No. DE-FG03-93ER40773, by the Ro-<lb/>manian Ministry for Research and Education under contract <lb/>No. 555/2000, and by the Robert A.

The Trojan Horse Method (THM) was applied to the <lb/> 3  He+ <lb/> 7  Li interaction in order to investigate <lb/>the quasi-free <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He reaction. The three-body experiment was performed at 33 MeV corresponding <lb/>to a <lb/> 7  Li-p relative energy ranging from 50 keV to 7 MeV. The extracted <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He quasi-free cross-<lb/>section was compared with the behavior of direct data, as well as with the result of a previous THM <lb/>investigation on the <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He reaction off the neutron in <lb/> 2  H. A good agreement between data sets <lb/>shows up throughout the energy range investigated, providing a very important validity test of the pole <lb/>approximation for the THM. <lb/> PACS. 24.10.-i Nuclear-reaction models and methods – 25.40.-h Nucleon-induced reactions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> In the last years, the Trojan Horse Method (THM) [1, <lb/>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] has proven to be a successful <lb/>indirect approach for studying charged-particle two-body <lb/>reactions relevant for astrophysics. The Trojan Horse <lb/>Method selects the quasi-free contribution of an appro-<lb/>priate three-body A + a → c + C + s reaction performed <lb/>at energies well above the Coulomb barrier to extract the <lb/>relevant two-body A + x → c + C reaction cross-section <lb/>at astrophysical energies free of Coulomb suppression as <lb/>well as electron screening effects. The method is based on <lb/>previous studies on quasi-free (QF) scattering and reac-<lb/>tions [13,14,15,16,17], where evidence for a QF mecha-<lb/>nism at energies of few tens of MeV was observed and <lb/>justified by the high momentum transferred to the out-<lb/>going particles, due to the high Q-value of the reactions <lb/>involved. When applying the method, kinematical condi-<lb/>tions are appropriately chosen in order that s be specta-<lb/>tor to the process and the x-s binding energy &quot; enough &quot; to <lb/>compensate for the A+a relative motion. The prescription <lb/>to calculate the accessible astrophysical energy region is <lb/>given by <lb/> ΔE  qf  = E  Ax  − B  xs  ± E  xs  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where E  Ax  is the beam energy in the center of mass of the <lb/>two-body A-x system, B  xs  represents the binding energy <lb/> a  e-mail: tumino@lns.infn.it <lb/> for the x-b system and E  xs  describes their inter-cluster <lb/>motion within a chosen cutoff in momentum. A key role is <lb/>thus played by the &quot; Trojan Horse nucleus &quot;  a, whose wave <lb/>function is required to have a large amplitude for a x − s <lb/> cluster configuration. However, a general view of the in-<lb/>fluence of its bound structure on the validity of the pole <lb/>approximation for the THM is still missing. Recently this <lb/>problem was addressed within an experimental program to <lb/>indirectly study relevant reactions destroying Li isotopes <lb/>in stellar environments. In particular the <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He re-<lb/>action, key reaction in the so-called &quot; Li problem &quot; , was <lb/>first investigated via <lb/> 2  H break-up and then by picking <lb/>the proton up from <lb/> 3  He. From the first investigation via <lb/>the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 7  Li, αα)n break-up process, very interesting results <lb/>were obtained [3,6,7,18]. Two resonances, associated with <lb/>the group of <lb/> 8  Be states between 19.9 and 20.2 MeV and <lb/>that around 22.2 MeV of excitation energy, contributing <lb/>to the <lb/> 7  Li-p direct cross section, could be observed also <lb/>in the indirect <lb/> 7  Li-p excitation function [18]. Moreover, <lb/>the behavior of the THM S(E)-factor at low energy was <lb/>found to be in very good agreement with that of stan-<lb/>dard measurements in the region where screening effects <lb/>are negligible. Estimates of the bare nucleus S  0  factor and <lb/>electron screening potential U  e  were obtained in PWIA [6] <lb/>as well as applying the more sophisticated MPWBA [5,7], <lb/>confirming the values from direct measurement, but with <lb/>smaller errors. Direct values are indeed affected by larger <lb/></body>

Diagram representing the quasi-free A+a → c+C +s re-<lb/>action; the nucleus A interacts only with the cluster x, leaving <lb/>particle s as spectator to the process. <lb/> uncertainties due to the extrapolation procedure employed <lb/>to get them [19]. In the present paper the THM results of <lb/>the <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He reaction via the <lb/> 7  Li( <lb/> 3  He, αα) <lb/> 2  H three-<lb/>body experiment analysed in PWIA are presented. A <lb/> 7  Li-<lb/>p relative energy range (0.2–7 MeV) including the men-<lb/>tioned resonances, was populated. Results may be even-<lb/>tually different due to the presence of a different &quot; Trojan <lb/>Horse nucleus &quot; ( <lb/> 3  He instead of <lb/> 2  H). Moreover a charged <lb/>spectator, as in the present case, may introduce some dis-<lb/>tortions in the exit channel. A good agreement between <lb/>direct and indirect two-body excitation functions also in <lb/>this case, would provide a very important validity test of <lb/>the pole approximation as well as of invariance of the re-<lb/>action amplitude for the two-body channel. <lb/> 2 Plane-Wave Impulse Approximation <lb/> In the phase space region where the QF mechanism is <lb/>expected to be present, the Impulse Approximation [20, <lb/>21] can be applied, which describes the quasi free A + a → <lb/> c + C + s reaction by a Pseudo Feynman diagram (see <lb/>fig. 1). <lb/>A pole of the diagram refers to the break-up of the <lb/>target nucleus a into the clusters x and s, and the other <lb/>one contains the information on the virtual A + x → c + C <lb/> two-body process. In order that this description be valid, <lb/>the following conditions have to be fulfilled [20]: <lb/> – The momentum transfer sufficiently high or equiva-<lb/>lently the associated wavelength sufficiently smaller <lb/>(less than 1 fm). Consequently the A − x interaction <lb/>can be considered confined. <lb/> – The incident center-of-mass energy higher than the <lb/>binding energy of clusters x-s. <lb/> In the Plane-Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) the <lb/>cross section of the three-body reaction can be factorized <lb/>into two terms corresponding to the two poles of fig. 1 [22, <lb/>23] and it is given by <lb/>d <lb/> 3  σ <lb/> dE  c  dΩ  c  dΩ  C <lb/> ∝ KF <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ  cm <lb/>  of f <lb/> · |Φ(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where <lb/> – [(dσ/dΩ)  cm  ] <lb/> of f  is the off-energy-shell differential cross <lb/>section for the two body A(x, c)C reaction at the <lb/>center-of-mass energy E  cm  given in post collision pre-<lb/>scription by <lb/> E  cm  = E  c-C  − Q  2b  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where Q  2b  is the two body Q-value of the A+x → c+C <lb/> reaction and E  c-C  is the relative energy between the <lb/>outgoing particles c and C. <lb/> – KF is a kinematical factor containing the final-state <lb/>phase-space factor and it is a function of masses, mo-<lb/>menta and angles of the outgoing particles: <lb/> KF = <lb/> μ  Aa  m  c <lb/> (2π)  5  ¯ h <lb/> 7 <lb/> p  C  p <lb/> 3 <lb/> c <lb/> p  Aa <lb/>  p  Bx <lb/> μ  Bx <lb/> − <lb/> p  Cc <lb/> m  c <lb/> · <lb/> p  c <lb/> p  c <lb/>  −1 <lb/> . (4) <lb/> – Φ(p  s  ) is the momentum distribution of the spectator <lb/>particle. In PWIA it is given by the Fourier trans-<lb/>form of the radial wave function χ(r) for the x-s <lb/> inter-cluster motion, usually described in terms of <lb/>Hänkel, Eckart and Hulthén functions depending on <lb/>the x-s system properties. Within momentum values <lb/>of 40–50 MeV/c, its shape cannot be distinguished <lb/>by those ones associated with more sophisticated ap-<lb/>proaches. <lb/>In the experimental work reported in the present paper, <lb/>the validity conditions of the IA appear to be fulfilled. In-<lb/>deed <lb/> 3  He has a quite high energy of 33 MeV (610 MeV/c <lb/>in momentum) corresponding to an associated de Broglie <lb/>wavelength of 0.32 fm, much smaller than the <lb/> 3  He mean <lb/>square radius of 1.95 fm. Once measured the three-body <lb/>cross-section, one can extract the cross-section for the <lb/> A + x interaction from eq. (2), under the assumption <lb/>that off-energy-shell effects are negligible. However, this <lb/>assumption has to be verified from comparison with di-<lb/>rect data. <lb/> 3 The experiment <lb/> The <lb/> 7  Li( <lb/> 3  He, αα) <lb/> 2  H experiment was performed at the Nu-<lb/>clear Physics Institute of ASCR in Rez, near Prague. A <lb/>33 MeV <lb/> 3  He cyclotron beam was delivered onto an isotopi-<lb/>cally enriched lithium fluoride target ( <lb/> 7  Li ≈ 95%). Two <lb/>silicon ΔE-E telescopes for α&apos;s identification, consisting <lb/>of 20 μm ΔE- and 1000 μm position-sensitive E-detector, <lb/> were placed on opposite sides with respect to the beam di-<lb/>rection covering the laboratory angles 94.6 <lb/> •  to 109.4 <lb/> •  and <lb/>44.3 <lb/> •  to 59.7 <lb/> •  . The angular ranges were chosen in order <lb/>to cover momentum values p  s  of the undetected deuteron <lb/>ranging from about −100 MeV/c to about 100 MeV/c. <lb/>This assures that the bulk of the QF contributions for the <lb/>break-up process of interest falls inside the investigated <lb/>regions, allowing also to cross check the method outside <lb/>the relevant phase-space regions. The trigger for the event <lb/>acquisition was given by the coincidences between the two <lb/>telescopes. <lb/></body>

In order to identify the channel of <lb/>interest and to choose the kinematical conditions where <lb/>the quasi-free process is dominant, α loci were selected <lb/>in the ΔE-E two-dimensional plots. An example of the <lb/> ΔE-E plot is shown in fig. 2, with the graphical cut to <lb/>select the α-particles. The kinematics were reconstructed <lb/> Fig. 4. Coincidence events in the α-α vs. α-d relative energy <lb/>plane. <lb/> under the assumption of a deuteron as third particle, lead-<lb/>ing to the locus of events in the E  α  vs. E  α  plane shown in <lb/>fig. 3. It reproduces very well the one calculated by using <lb/>a three-body kinematical calculation. At least three cor-<lb/>related groups of events can be recognized in the figure, <lb/>corresponding to excited states of <lb/> 8  Be, which decay into <lb/>the two α&apos;s in the exit channel. The first group from the <lb/>left is fed by the 16.6 and 16.9 MeV states, the second <lb/>one is due to the states between 19.9 and 20.2 MeV, while <lb/>the third one corresponds to the 22.2 and 22.9 MeV levels. <lb/>These states have all isospin T = 0 and natural parity. The <lb/> Q-value spectrum for these events shows a peak at about <lb/>12 MeV, which refers to the α+α+d channel of interest <lb/>whose calculated Q-value is 11.85 MeV. However, the Q-<lb/> value for the <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He two-body reaction (17.35 MeV) <lb/>is larger than the excitation energies of the <lb/> 8  Be states con-<lb/>tributing to the first group of events. Thus these states will <lb/>not appear as resonances in the <lb/> 7  Li-p excitation function. <lb/>The resulting spectra make us confident on the quality of <lb/>the performed calibration, and on the possibility to well <lb/>identify the α+α+d channel. Another representation of <lb/>the coincidence events is given by projecting them onto <lb/>the 2D-plot of relative energies for any two of the three <lb/>final particles. The 2D-plot for α-α vs. α-d relative ener-<lb/>gies is shown in fig. 4. In this representation very clear <lb/>horizontal loci show up, corresponding to the groups of <lb/> 8  Be states recognized in fig. 2. As expected, neither ver-<lb/>tical nor diagonal loci associated with the excitation of <lb/> 6  Li, seem to be present, because no α decaying states can <lb/>contribute in this α-d relative energy region. <lb/>The <lb/> 8  Be excited states can be populated via quasi-<lb/>free mechanism or via sequential decay. A way to investi-<lb/>gate the reaction mechanism involved and to disentangle <lb/>quasi-free coincidence events from other, is to investigate <lb/>the behavior of the coincidence yield depending on the <lb/>deuteron momentum p  s  for all coincidence events, in the <lb/>whole angular range covered by the detectors.

The <lb/> 7  Li-p relative energy was calculated <lb/>in post collision prescription from eq. (3). Data were ana-<lb/>lyzed in PWIA, applying the factorization of eq.

The further analysis was performed by consid-<lb/>ering coincidence events with a neutron momentum rang-<lb/>ing between −30 and 30 MeV/c. Following the PWIA ap-<lb/>proach, the two-body cross-section was derived dividing <lb/>the selected three-body coincidence yield by the result of <lb/>a Monte Carlo calculation reproducing the behavior of the <lb/> KF Φ(p  s  ) product (see eq.

An error cal-<lb/>culation for the <lb/> 7  Li-p relative energy was also performed <lb/>giving a value ranging from 80 to 120 keV, the minimum <lb/>estimate corresponding to the phase space region where <lb/>the lens effect is more efficient [25]. In the extracted off-<lb/>energy shell <lb/> 7  Li-p two-body cross-section, penetrability <lb/>effects were included before the comparison with direct <lb/>data [19,26,27]. Both s and p waves in the entrance chan-<lb/>nel had to be considered, the s-wave describing the non-<lb/>resonant behavior, while the p-wave being responsible of <lb/>the resonant contributions. Thus Coulomb as well as l = 1 <lb/>centrifugal barrier were accounted for in the procedure. <lb/>In order to perform the comparison, direct data were in-<lb/>tegrated over the same θ  cm  angular region covered in the <lb/>present experiment (50 <lb/> •  –70 <lb/> •  ), θ  cm  , being the emission an-<lb/>gle for one outgoing α-particle in the α-α center-of-mass <lb/>system [4,7,8,11]. The comparison is shown in fig. 7, where <lb/>full dots represent our data, while the behavior of direct <lb/>data from [19,26,27] is shown as full line, both sets aver-<lb/>aged out at the same energy bin of 100 keV comparable <lb/>with the uncertainty. The normalization to the direct data <lb/>was performed in the <lb/> 7  Li-p relative energy region between <lb/>2 and 3 MeV. Our former data via <lb/> 2  H break-up [18] are <lb/>also reported in the figure as open squares. Data sets agree <lb/>quite well throughout the investigated range, including the <lb/>resonant regions. It is important to underline that with a <lb/>single normalization parameter it was possible to repro-<lb/>duce the direct cross section over a wide <lb/> 7  Li-p relative <lb/>energy range. The good agreement validates the pole ap-<lb/>proximation for this experiment together with the PWIA <lb/>approach and, importantly, the present results with <lb/> 3  He <lb/>as &quot; Trojan Horse nucleus &quot; agree with the previous investi-<lb/>gation of the <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He reaction off the neutron in <lb/> 2  H. <lb/>Therefore the invariance of the reaction amplitude for this <lb/>two-body process is confirmed within the experimental er-<lb/>rors. <lb/> 5 Conclusions <lb/> The <lb/> 7  Li(p, α) <lb/> 4  He reaction was investigated by selecting <lb/>the quasi-free contribution to the <lb/> 3  He( <lb/> 7  Li, αα) <lb/> 2  H three-<lb/>body reaction performed at 33 MeV. The two-body cross-<lb/>section was deduced in PWIA approach and compared <lb/>with the direct behavior as well as with previous indirect <lb/>data from the <lb/> 7  Li(d, αα)n [18]. The good agreement be-<lb/>tween the sets of data suggests that <lb/> 3  He is a good &quot; Trojan <lb/>Horse nucleus &quot; , in spite of its quite high binding energy <lb/>(5.85 MeV) and that the validity of the pole approxima-<lb/>tion, at least for the <lb/> 7  Li+p interaction, is not &quot; Trojan <lb/>Horse nucleus &quot; dependent. Although the present analysis <lb/>in PWIA does not include Coulomb distortions due to the <lb/>charged spectator, these effects seem not so important. <lb/>The possibility to employ the simple PWIA is a relevant <lb/>result, because it allows to simplify the theoretical formu-<lb/>lation. However, from recent THM investigations [7,11, <lb/>12] it comes out that more sophisticated approaches can <lb/>be needed at sub-Coulomb energies in order to extract the <lb/>cross-section of astrophysical interest. An important effect <lb/>to be considered is the Coulomb distortion in the parti-<lb/>cle wave functions of the two-body exit channel. Further <lb/>investigation of this experimental work with theoretical <lb/>approaches based on the DWBA formalism is thus needed <lb/>in order to better understand these important aspects. <lb/> This work was supported in part by OTKA T49245 and <lb/>IN64269. <lb/></body>

The low-energy, bare-nucleus cross section for <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C is extracted by means of the Trojan-<lb/>Horse Method applied to the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 15  N, α <lb/> 12  C)n reaction at E  beam  = 60 MeV. The astrophysical S-factor is <lb/>compared to the direct data in the same energy region. A nice agreement shows up down to 100 keV, while <lb/>the low-energy behaviour of the S-factor suggests a smaller rate than is reported in the literature. <lb/> PACS. 24.10.-i Nuclear Reaction Models and Methods – 26.20.+f Hydrostatic Stellar Nucleosynthesis <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The importance of <lb/> 19  F in astrophysics is two-fold: in red <lb/>giants fluorine is enhanced by large factors with respect <lb/>to the solar abundance; on the other hand, the fluorine <lb/>abundances observed in giants can constrain AGB star <lb/>models [1]. Primary sources of uncertainty in predicting <lb/>fluorine abundances in AGB stars come from the adopted <lb/>reaction rates and the treatment of nucleosynthesis during <lb/>the thermal pulses and the interpulse periods [2]. <lb/>The reaction rate for the <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C affects the pro-<lb/>duction of fluorine since it removes both protons and <lb/> 15  N <lb/>nuclei from the <lb/> 19  F production chain [1]. Calculations <lb/>show that even the highest experimentally observed sur-<lb/>face fluorine abundances are reproduced for some masses <lb/>and metallicities, but this occurs for C/O values much <lb/>larger than what experimental data suggest [1]. In fact <lb/> 12  C <lb/>and <lb/> 19  F are correlated since they are both dredged up to <lb/>the stellar surface in correspondence of the third dredge-<lb/>up. The <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C reaction rate introduces at least an <lb/>8% uncertainty in the fluorine surface abundance [1], since <lb/>NACRE [3] and CF88 [4] rates show up a factor 2 differ-<lb/>ence. <lb/>As the <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C experimental cross section is mea-<lb/>sured down to 80 keV [5], much larger than the Gamow <lb/>peak energy (8 keV), only extrapolations are available in <lb/>the low energy region. <lb/> a  e-mail: spitaleri@lns.infn.it <lb/> 1.1 The Trojan-Horse Method <lb/> The measurement of nuclear cross sections at ultra-low en-<lb/>ergies is a very difficult task because of the presence of the <lb/>Coulomb barrier exponentially damping the cross section. <lb/>Therefore extrapolation is necessary when data at astro-<lb/>physical energies are unavailable, thus introducing addi-<lb/>tional uncertainties related to poorly known low-energy or <lb/>subthreshold resonances and to the electron screening ef-<lb/>fect [6]. The extrapolation procedure is usually performed <lb/>on the astrophysical factor <lb/> S(E) = E · exp(2πη) · σ(E), <lb/> (1) <lb/>where η is the Sommerfeld parameter, S(E) being a <lb/>smoothly varying function of the energy even in the sub-<lb/>Coulomb region. A possible way to avoid extrapolation <lb/>from data at energies much higher than the Gamow win-<lb/>dow is the application of the Trojan-Horse Method. <lb/>The Trojan-Horse Method (THM) [7,8] is an indirect <lb/>method that allows for the extraction of the bare nucleus <lb/>cross section of a two-body reaction of astrophysical in-<lb/>terest, <lb/> A + x → c + C, <lb/> (2) <lb/>by selecting the Quasi-Free (QF) contribution of the cross <lb/>section of a suitable three-body process <lb/> A + a → c + C + s, <lb/> (3) <lb/>where x acts as participant and s as a spectator to the two-<lb/>body reaction.

			<body> than the Coulomb barrier in the A + a channel, then the <lb/>reaction (2) can be induced inside the nuclear interac-<lb/>tion field. The nucleus a, having a high probability for the <lb/> x⊕s configuration, constitutes the so-called Trojan-Horse <lb/> Nucleus since it brings the cluster x inside the target A <lb/> nuclear field. Therefore the Coulomb barrier and electron <lb/>screening effect are negligible and a measurement of the <lb/>cross section at ultra-low energies is possible. <lb/>In the simple Plane-Wave Impulse Approximation <lb/>(PWIA) post-form approach [8] the two-body bare nucleus <lb/>cross section is extracted from the measured three-body <lb/>cross section using the equation <lb/>d <lb/> 3  σ <lb/> dE  C  dΩ  C  dΩ  c <lb/> ∝ KF |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  dσ <lb/> N <lb/>l <lb/> dΩ <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where KF is a kinematical factor, |G(p  s  )| <lb/> 2  the momentum <lb/>distribution of spectator particle s inside a and dσ <lb/> N <lb/>l  /dΩ <lb/> the nuclear (off-energy-shell) cross section, under the hy-<lb/>pothesis of a dominant l-contribution. In fact, since the <lb/>reaction (2) is induced inside the short-range nuclear field <lb/>the penetration probability of the Coulomb barrier has to <lb/>be introduced in order to compare the THM cross section <lb/>with the direct data from literature in the energy region <lb/>below the Coulomb barrier [9]: <lb/> P  l  (k  Ax  R) = <lb/>1 <lb/> F  2 <lb/> l  (k  Ax  R) + G  2 <lb/> l  (k  Ax  R) <lb/>, <lb/> (5) <lb/>where F  l  and G  l  are the regular and irregular Coulomb <lb/>wave functions, k  Ax  and R the A−x relative wave number <lb/>and interaction radius, respectively. <lb/>In the present work, the measurement of the bare-<lb/>nucleus cross section for the <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C reaction is <lb/>presented in the astrophysically relevant energy region, <lb/>from 600 keV down to 5 keV. The indirect two-body <lb/>cross section is extracted in arbitrary units from the <lb/> 2  H( <lb/> 15  N, α <lb/> 12  C)n coincidence yield in the PWIA approach <lb/>and is normalized to the direct data to get the abso-<lb/>lute cross section. In the measured energy region, the <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C cross section is dominated by the 1 <lb/> −  reso-<lb/>nance at 314 keV [3], therefore this study allows one to <lb/>perform a complete validity test of the THM below the <lb/>Coulomb barrier. <lb/> 2 The experiment <lb/> The experiment was performed at the Texas A&amp;M Uni-<lb/>versity Cyclotron Institute. The K500 superconducting cy-<lb/>clotron provided a 60 MeV <lb/> 15  N beam with a spot size on <lb/>target of 1 mm and intensities up to 5 nA, impinging on <lb/>a 200 μg/cm <lb/> 2  thick CD  2  target. A simple experimental <lb/>setup was used: a telescope (A) made up of an ionization <lb/>chamber and a silicon position-sensitive detector (PSD) to <lb/>discriminate carbon nuclei, and a couple of silicon PSD&apos;s <lb/>(B, C) on the opposite side with respect to the beam di-<lb/>rection.

In fig. 2 the Q-value spectrum is reported, show-<lb/>ing two peaks corresponding to the ground state and first <lb/>excited state of <lb/> 12  C (Q-values 2.74 MeV and −1.70 MeV <lb/>respectively). <lb/>The good agreement between the experimental and the <lb/>theoretical Q-values confirms the accuracy of the calibra-<lb/>tion. In the subsequent analysis only the events corre-<lb/>sponding to the high-energy peak are retained in order <lb/>to extract the <lb/> 15  N(p, α  0  ) <lb/> 12  C cross section. In fact, the <lb/> 15  N(p, α  1  ) <lb/> 12  C reaction is of negligible astrophysical rel-<lb/>evance in the context outlined in the introduction, since <lb/>its cross section is much lower than the <lb/> 15  N(p, α  0  ) <lb/> 12  C one <lb/>inside the Gamow peak [5]. For this reason in the following <lb/>sections the 0 will be dropped. <lb/>The second step of the THM data analysis is the study <lb/>of the reaction mechanisms feeding the exit channel. This <lb/>is a necessary step to disentangle the QF from the se-<lb/>quential decay mechanisms. Such a selection is fulfilled <lb/>by investigating the correlation between the relative ener-<lb/>gies (E  α-n  vs. E12  C-α  and E12  C-n  vs. E12  C-α  , as shown in <lb/>figs. 3a and 3b, respectively) of the detected particles and <lb/>between E12  C-α  and the neutron momentum p  s  (fig. 4). <lb/>In the α-n vs. <lb/> 12  C-α (fig. 3a) and <lb/> 12  C-n vs. <lb/> 12  C-α <lb/>(fig. 3b) relative energy two-dimensional plots very clear <lb/>vertical loci appear, corresponding to excited states of <lb/> 16  O <lb/>at 12.44 MeV, 13.09 MeV and 13.26 MeV. An additional <lb/>contribution to the three-body cross section due to the <lb/>sequential decay of the excited states of <lb/> 13  C at 6.68 MeV, <lb/>7.49 MeV, 7.55 MeV, 7.67 MeV (where the last three lev-<lb/>els are not resolved) is also visible, corresponding to the <lb/>horizontal loci in fig. 3b.

At higher E12  C-α <lb/> the occurrence of the <lb/> 13  C sequential decay is clearly vis-<lb/>ible, but its contribution in the astrophysically relevant <lb/>energy region is absolutely negligible. From the compari-<lb/>son of the loci corresponding to the different level decays, <lb/>the quasi-free origin of the <lb/> 16  O levels in fig. 4 is apparent. <lb/>In fact, while the kinematical locus connected to the <lb/> 13  C <lb/>decay is still clearly visible at high neutron momentum, <lb/>the contributions due to the <lb/> 16  O decay is barely visible <lb/>(in comparison with the background) showing a definite <lb/>correlation of the coincidence yield for the cited <lb/> 16  O levels <lb/>with the spectator neutron momentum. <lb/>As a further check to determine if the resonances oc-<lb/>curring in the <lb/> 12  C-α channel are fed through a quasi free <lb/>mechanism and not through sequential decay of interme-<lb/>diate nuclei, the E  c.m.  relative energy for the <lb/> 15  N(p, α) <lb/> 12  C <lb/>reaction, defined as [8] <lb/> E  c.m.  = E12  C-α  − Q  2-body  , <lb/> (6) <lb/>is reported as a function of the momentum p  s  of the spec-<lb/>tator particle for all coincidence events. In order to ex-<lb/>plore the behaviour of the coincidence yield as a function <lb/>of the momentum p  s  , the relative energy E  c.m.  spectra di-<lb/>vided by the phase-space contribution were reconstructed <lb/>for different ranges of the neutron momentum p  s  . Within <lb/>the range 0 to 20 MeV/c (fig. 5, top panel) the coincidence <lb/>yield appears to be dominated by the decay of the three <lb/>levels of <lb/> 16  O at 12.44 MeV, 13.09 MeV and 13.26 MeV.

The single-particle structure and shell gap of <lb/> 100  Sn as inferred from previous in-beam γ-ray <lb/> spectroscopy has been confirmed in recent studies of seniority and spin-gap isomers by γγ, βγ, βpγ, pγ <lb/> and 2pγ spectroscopy. The results for <lb/> 94,95  Ag, <lb/> 98  Cd and its N = 50 isotones <lb/> 96  Pd and <lb/> 94  Ru stress the <lb/>importance of large-scale shell model calculations employing realistic interactions for the isomerism, np-nh <lb/> excitations, seniority mixing and E2 polarisation of the <lb/> 100  Sn core. The strong monopole interaction of <lb/>the Δl = 0, 1 spin/isospin-flip partners πg  9/2  -νg  7/2  along the N = 50 isotones and the πf  5/2  -νg  9/2  pair of <lb/>nucleons along the Z = 28 Ni isotopes are decisive for the evolution of the shell structure towards <lb/> 100  Sn <lb/>and <lb/> 78  Ni. It can be traced back to the tensor force in the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and provides <lb/>a straightforward explanation for new shells in neutron-rich light nuclei, implying qualitative predictions <lb/>for new N = 32, 34 subshells in Ca isotopes, persistence of the <lb/> 78  Ni proton and neutron shell gaps and <lb/>non-equivalence of the g  9/2  valence mirror Ni isotopes and N = 50 isotones. This is corroborated by recent <lb/>experimental data on <lb/> 56,58  Cr and <lb/> 70–76  Ni. The implication of monopole driven shell evolution for apparent <lb/>spin-orbit splitting towards N  Z and structure along the astrophysical r-path between N = 50 and <lb/> N = 82 is discussed. <lb/> PACS. 21.60.Cs Shell model – 23.20.-g Electromagnetic transitions – 27.30.+t 16 ≤ A ≤ 68 – 27.60.+j <lb/>78 ≤ A ≤ 132 – 26.50.+x Nuclear physics aspects of the r-process <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The evolution of shell structure towards exotic nuclei with <lb/>extreme isospin has become, and will be for the future, the <lb/>major topic of experimental studies and the main chal-<lb/>lenge for realistic in-medium nucleon-nucleon (NN) inter-<lb/>actions as used in large-scale shell model and mean field <lb/>theory. Especially on the neutron-rich side of the Segré <lb/>chart, where the drip line for A ≥ 80 is far beyond reach <lb/>for experiments, the understanding of the underlying shell <lb/>driving mechanism is of key importance for astrophysics <lb/>applications as, e.g., the r-process. Two scenarios with dif-<lb/>fering experimental signature have been proposed to de-<lb/>scribe the shell structure of nuclei on the pathway towards <lb/>large N/Z ratios. The first is based on the larger radial ex-<lb/>tension and a softer neutron potential. This shifts large-l <lb/> a  Conference presenter e-mail: h.grawe@gsi.de <lb/> orbitals upward in energy and reduces the spin-orbit (SO) <lb/>splitting, which is proportional to the potential gradient, <lb/>for nucleon orbitals probing the nuclear surface [1,2]. Thus <lb/>for medium-heavy and heavy nuclei the harmonic oscilla-<lb/>tor (HO) unique-parity shells are restored. The changing <lb/>shell structure evolves smoothly with A and N/Z and only <lb/>large variations of these parameters as expected towards <lb/>the neutron dripline will have substantial effects. The sec-<lb/>ond scenario originates from the strong monopole shifts <lb/>of selected shell model orbits which have been ascribed <lb/>to the στ central and the tensor force of the NN interac-<lb/>tion [3,4,5,6]. This will be discussed in sect. 3 and recent <lb/>experimental evidence for monopole driven shell structure <lb/>and apparent SO splitting from the <lb/> 100–132  Sn and <lb/> 48  Ca to <lb/> 78  Ni regions is presented in sects. 2 and 4.

This implies the existence of <lb/>analogous structure features such as softness with respect <lb/>to L = 2 core excitations, a pronounced Gamow-Teller <lb/>resonance due to the πg  9/2  -νg  7/2  respective πf  7/2  -νf  5/2 <lb/> proton-neutron orbitals, a substantial amount of np-nh <lb/> configurations besides the doubly-magic configuration <lb/>in the ground state of <lb/> 100  Sn, high-spin isomers, and <lb/>possibly even proton decay. The study of seniority and <lb/>spin-gap isomers provides a sensitive probe of single <lb/>particle energies, residual interaction, core excitation <lb/>and shell gaps as demonstrated in recent experiments on <lb/> 98  Cd [10] and <lb/> 94  Ag [11]. The status of observed isomers <lb/>and shell model predicted ones and their main structure <lb/>features in terms of the leading proton-neutron g <lb/> n <lb/> 9/2 <lb/> configuration are summarised in fig. 1.

Decay channels for the I <lb/> π  = (21 <lb/> +  ) isomer in <lb/> 94  Ag. <lb/> The spin-gap isomers with the highest spins, as, e.g., <lb/> the I <lb/> π  = (37/2) <lb/> +  state in <lb/> 95  Ag, which exhaust the πνg <lb/> n <lb/> 9/2 <lb/> configuration, are not predicted to be isomeric in the <lb/>proton-neutron (p  1/2  , g  9/2  ) valence space [17] and require <lb/>excitation of the <lb/> 100  Sn core. This has been studied re-<lb/>cently in a dedicated prompt-delayed experiment at the <lb/>EUROBALL IV array, where the I <lb/> π  = (12 <lb/> +  ) core excited <lb/>isomer in <lb/> 98  Cd, the two-proton hole neighbour of <lb/> 100  Sn, <lb/>was identified [10]. The decay pattern exhibits a striking <lb/>analogy to <lb/> 54  Fe, two proton holes from <lb/> 56  Ni [9,18]. The <lb/>level scheme, the core excited isomer and the E2 transi-<lb/>tion rates are excellently reproduced by a large scale shell <lb/>model (LSSM) calculation in the (0g, 1d, 2s) model space <lb/>allowing for up to 4p4h excitations of the <lb/> 100  Sn core. Val-<lb/>ues of 6.46 (15) MeV for the <lb/> 100  Sn shell gap were inferred <lb/>from the excitation energy of the I <lb/> π  = (12 <lb/> +  ) E4 iso-<lb/>mer, and a small proton polarisation charge of δe  π  ≤ 0.2e <lb/>was extracted from the πg <lb/> −2 <lb/> 9/2  ; I <lb/> π  = (8 <lb/> +  ) E2 isomeric de-<lb/>cay [10,19]. It should be noted that the LSSM, which ex-<lb/>hibits good predictive power for isomers and E2 strengths <lb/>in the whole region between N = 50 and the N = Z line <lb/>(see below <lb/> 94  Ag and sect. 4.2), also predicts an I <lb/> π  = 14 <lb/> + <lb/> E6 isomer in <lb/> 98  Cd and an I <lb/> π  = 6 <lb/> +  E2 isomer in <lb/> 100  Sn. <lb/>Like the I <lb/> π  = 25/2 <lb/> +  and 16 <lb/> +  E6 isomers in <lb/> 97,96  Cd, which <lb/>are expected [17] and searched for since long, they await <lb/>future experimental verification (fig. 1). <lb/>A second example for the sensitivity of spin-gap iso-<lb/>mers to subtle structure details such as single particle <lb/>energies, shell gaps and proton-neutron (πν) interaction <lb/>even in LSSM calculations is provided by the I <lb/> π  = (21 <lb/> +  ) <lb/>isomer in <lb/> 94  Ag. This state features exotic properties with <lb/>respect to spin, excitation energy and decay modes (fig. 2) <lb/>to a degree, which is unprecedented in the Segré chart [11, <lb/>20,21,22].

			<body> – one-proton emitter (l = 4, 6) with extremely small <lb/>spectroscopic factor (&lt; 10 <lb/> −5  for l = 4); <lb/> – correlated two-proton emission dominates as sequen-<lb/>tial decay is hindered by small spectroscopic factor and <lb/>large γ-decay widths; <lb/> – two-proton width largely enhanced due to a highly de-<lb/>formed shape isomer. <lb/>It is obvious that the characteristics of the one-proton and <lb/>correlated two-proton emission are beyond the scope of <lb/>even the LSSM calculations. Nevertheless in the simplest <lb/>valence hole space the spectroscopic factor for l = 4 proton <lb/>emission is only 4% and the quadrupole moment of the <lb/>parent state is larger by more than a factor of two relative <lb/>to the daughter. It should be noted that the high-spin <lb/>isomers I <lb/> π  = (37/2 <lb/> +  ) in <lb/> 95  Ag and I <lb/> π  = (12 <lb/> +  , 14 <lb/> +  ) in <lb/> 98  Cd are further candidates for direct proton emission. <lb/>The success of the shell model in the description of the <lb/>high-spin isomerism is due to the fact that the πν realistic <lb/>interaction is well tuned for the model space and gives a <lb/>correct description of the evolution of single-particle ener-<lb/>gies. In fig. 4 the extrapolation of single neutron energies <lb/>from experimentally known values in <lb/> 88  Sr respective <lb/> 90  Zr <lb/>to <lb/> 100  Sn is shown for two different realistic interactions <lb/>GG [23] and MHJ [24]. The agreement with experimen-<lb/>tally identified single-neutron states in N = 51 nuclei and <lb/>among the two interactions demonstrates the reliability of <lb/>this shell model aided extrapolation. The deviations as, <lb/> e.g., the d  5/2  -g  7/2  inversion in <lb/> 101  Sn show the systematic <lb/>uncertainty of the procedure, which in this specific case <lb/>is due to an improper πg  9/2  νg  7/2  monopole in the MHJ <lb/>interaction, which will be further discussed in sect. 5. <lb/>It is the monopole part of the πν interaction that deter-<lb/>mines the evolution of the neutron single particle (hole) <lb/>energies and the N = 50 shell gap upon filling of the <lb/> π0g  9/2  orbit from the experimentally known Z = 40 re-<lb/>gion towards Z = 50 (fig. 4). The monopole for a specific <lb/>multiplet (j, j <lb/>  ) is defined by <lb/> V <lb/> m <lb/>jj   = <lb/> J <lb/> (2J + 1)jj <lb/>  J |V | jj <lb/>  J/ <lb/> J <lb/> (2J + 1), <lb/>(1) <lb/>which gives rise to the single-particle energy evolution be-<lb/>tween two shell closures CS and CS <lb/>  [9] <lb/> CS <lb/>j <lb/> = <lb/> CS <lb/> j <lb/> + <lb/> j  <lb/> (2j <lb/>  + 1 − δ  jj   )V <lb/> m <lb/>jj   . <lb/> (2) <lb/>The Kronecker symbol applies for T = 1 and identical <lb/>orbitals to maintain the Pauli principle. This simple for-<lb/>mula can be used to calculate the single particle energies <lb/>for <lb/> 100  Sn from the experimentally known ones in <lb/> 90  Zr or <lb/> 88  Sr as shown in fig. 4 for neutrons and a given residual <lb/>interaction. It should be noted that eq. (2) holds only for <lb/>closed j <lb/>  shells, i.e. in the example of fig. 4 (j <lb/>  = πg  9/2  ) for <lb/> 90  Zr and <lb/> 100  Sn, in between due to configuration mixing the <lb/>trend deviates from a strict scaling with the j <lb/>  = πg  9/2  oc-<lb/>cupation and the exact progression can be inferred from <lb/>a full shell model calculation (see fig. 4).

This is a very general feature of the πν inter-<lb/>action which is especially strong when the corresponding <lb/>radial wave functions have good overlap [5,9] (see sect. 3). <lb/>We also note that the evolution of neutron single-particle <lb/>energies from <lb/> 90  Zr (Z = 40) to <lb/> 100  Sn (Z = 50) and single <lb/>hole energies from <lb/> 132  Sn to <lb/> 122  Zr is described by the same <lb/>interaction only slightly modified due to the different core <lb/>mass (see sect. 5). <lb/> 3 Monopole driven shell structure in <lb/>neutron-rich nuclei <lb/> Strong monopole drifts are not restricted to the examples <lb/>shown in fig. 4 but have been experimentally observed <lb/>all over the Segré chart, the most prominent being the <lb/> Δl = 0 spin-orbit πν pairs 0p  3/2  -0p  1/2  , 0d  5/2  -0d  3/2  , 0f  7/2  -<lb/>0f  5/2  , 0g  9/2  -0g  7/2  and the Δl = 1 spin-flip pairs 0p  1/2  -<lb/>0d  5/2  , 0d  3/2  -0f  7/2  , 0f  5/2  -0g  9/2  , 0g  7/2  -0h  11/2  . They are <lb/>summarised in recent reviews [3,5,9,25] and can be traced <lb/>back to the στ and tensor parts of the NN interaction [3, <lb/>4]. The empirical evidence translates into the following cri-<lb/>teria for strong monopoles: i) the interacting nucleons are <lb/>spin-flip partners with ii) Δl = 0, 1, 2 and iii) should have <lb/>the same number of nodes in their radial wave functions <lb/>to optimize the overlap. These features are also borne out <lb/>in realistic interactions as derived from effective NN po-<lb/>tentials fitted to scattering data via standard many-body <lb/>techniques [24] as shown in fig. 17 of [9].

Schematic illustration of signatures for tensor force driven shell evolution. <lb/> effects the monopole part is not determined well and has to <lb/>be tuned to experimental shell evolution, which hampers <lb/>their predictive power. The dramatic impact of monopole <lb/>drifts and the sensitivity to subtle details of the interac-<lb/>tion is due to the factor (2j <lb/>  + 1) in eq. (2) which is large <lb/>in filling (emptying) a high-spin orbital j <lb/>  and translates <lb/>monopole corrections of about 100 keV into MeV. <lb/>On the NN interaction level the strong monopoles are <lb/>due to the tensor force <lb/> V = −|v  T  (r)|(τ  1  · τ  2  )([σ  1  · σ  2  ] <lb/> (2)  Y <lb/> (2)  (Ω)), <lb/>(3) <lb/>which can be shown to reduce within a unique parity har-<lb/>monic oscillator shell to [4] to the central στ force <lb/> V = −|v  στ  (r)|(τ  1  · τ  2  )(σ  1  · σ  2  ) <lb/>(4) <lb/> 3.1 New shells in light nuclei and shell reordering in <lb/>medium-heavy nuclei <lb/> In fig. 5 the shell driving signatures of these interactions <lb/>are compared schematically. <lb/> – In light nuclei within unique harmonic-oscillator shells <lb/>starting with an ls-closed N = Z doubly magic nucleus <lb/>as <lb/> 16  O or <lb/> 40  Ca and proceeding towards N  Z along <lb/>an isotonic chain by proton removal the HO magic neu-<lb/>tron number N  m  is changed to N  m  − 2 · N , where N <lb/> is the HO principal quantum number. This is due to <lb/>the fact that upon emptying the πj = l + 1/2 orbit <lb/>the νj = l − 1/2 becomes less bound due to the strong <lb/> Δl = 0 (spin-orbit partners) στ monopole. Before the <lb/>empty πj = l − 1/2 orbit releases the νj <lb/>  = l + 1 − 1/2 <lb/>orbit of the adjacent shell by action of the tensor <lb/> Δl = 1 (spin-flip) monopole and stabilises the N  m <lb/> neutron shell for Z = N  m  − 2 · N as observed in <lb/> 14  C, <lb/> 36  S and <lb/> 34  S, which demonstrates the isospin symme-<lb/>try of the scenario. This converts an ls closed shell <lb/> N  m  = 8 ( <lb/> 16  O), 20 ( <lb/> 40  Ca), 40 ( <lb/> 68  Ni) into jj closures <lb/> N <lb/> m  = 6, (14)16, (32)34. The ambiguity is due to the <lb/>presence of a j = 1/2 shell which exhibits a strong <lb/> T = 1, J = 0 pairing matrix element (identical with <lb/>the monopole for j = 1/2), and thus opens another gap <lb/>upon filling or emptying this orbit. The scenario shown <lb/>on the left side of fig. 5 gives rise to a new shell closure <lb/>chart as shown in refs. [5,6,9]. Simultaneously the iso-<lb/>tones in the HO oscillator semi-magic nuclei due the <lb/>shell quenching and particle-hole excitations across the <lb/>shell develop deformation as observed in <lb/> 12  Be (fig. 20 <lb/>in ref.

As <lb/>for heavier nuclei the spin-orbit force increases so much <lb/>that it does not determine the shell gap alone, in spite <lb/>of the SO split reduction by the tensor force the shell <lb/>gap is only reduced but not fully quenched. The effect <lb/>is experimentally well established as shown in fig. 16 <lb/>b,c of ref. [9] and in fig. 6 below for the νg  9/2  πf and <lb/>the νh  11/2  πg. This will be further discussed in sects. 4 <lb/>and 5. <lb/> 3.2 Apparent spin-orbit splitting driven by monopole <lb/>shift <lb/> The signatures listed in fig. 5 and with respect to SO split-<lb/>ting may be compared to the scenario described in the <lb/>introduction (sect. 1). They are not restricted to neutron-<lb/>rich nuclei as they are symmetric in isospin, i.e. they hold <lb/>for exchange of protons and neutrons though their impor-<lb/>tance to proton-rich nuclei is limited due to the close-lying <lb/>dripline. The sign of the change in SO splitting reverses <lb/>upon filling/emptying of an orbit. It is in contrast for the <lb/>shell quenching scenario described in sect. 1 i) not deter-<lb/>mined by the gradient in N/Z ratio and ii) not restricted <lb/>to neutron orbits. This is illustrated in fig. 6 for the Z = 51 <lb/>(Sb) single particle states when filling the major neutron <lb/>shell from <lb/> 100  Sn to <lb/> 132  Sn. In the following qualitative dis-<lb/>cussion it should be kept in mind that the neutron orbitals <lb/>are not filled successively but due to configuration mix-<lb/>ing partly in parallel, and that spectroscopic factors have <lb/>been measured consistently only for the πg  7/2  and πh  11/2 <lb/> states [28]. Striking monopole drifts can be observed for <lb/>the πνg  7/2  -h  11/2  and the πνd  3/2  -d  5/2  pair of nucleons. <lb/> – It is known since long that the πg  7/2  is more strongly <lb/>bound relative to the πd  5/2  reference state as soon <lb/>as the νh  11/2  is filled above N = 64 with a net ef-<lb/>fect of ∼ 1.9 MeV. The same monopole determines the <lb/>downsloping of the πh  11/2  upon filling of the νg  7/2  be-<lb/>tween N = 50 and 64 by ∼ 1.2 MeV. The ratio of <lb/>the net effects according to eq. (2) is close to that of <lb/>the multiplicities (2j + 1) of the filled neutron orbitals, <lb/>namely 12/8. The exact trend is distorted in this case <lb/>as the νg  7/2  is also acting on the πd  5/2  reference state. <lb/>From eq. (5) one would expect that the πg  9/2  spin-<lb/>orbit partner would be lifted up by filling of the νh  11/2 <lb/> which should result in a reduced πg SO splitting. The <lb/>latter effect is masked and compensated, however, by <lb/>the strong (see fig. 4) πg  9/2  -νg  7/2  monopole, as the <lb/> νg  7/2  is filled before and/or in parallel. <lb/> – With respect to apparent spin-orbit splitting the <lb/> πd  3/2  -d  5/2  distance is a much better study object. The <lb/>splitting reduces from N = 50 to 56 when the νd  5/2 <lb/> orbit is filled, it increases from N = 78 to 82 when the <lb/>filling of the νd  3/2  binds the reference level πd  5/2  more <lb/>strongly than the πd  3/2  . As it is the identical monopole <lb/>which rules the shift, the ratio of down-and up-shift <lb/>should be 4/6. In fact the ratio is smaller and this is <lb/>due to two other neutron orbitals that are being filled <lb/>in between. From N = 56 to 64 the splitting increases <lb/>due to the νg  7/2  filling effect on the πd  5/2  reference <lb/>while from N = 64 to 76 it reduces again due to the <lb/> πd  3/2  -νh  11/2  monopole. Again the multiplicity factor <lb/>12/8 results in a net decrease of the SO splitting, if the <lb/>two different monopoles involved have a similar value. <lb/>As the sign of the SO splitting always places the j  &lt;  level <lb/>above the j  &gt;  it can be concluded that a major part of the <lb/>observed SO reduction for proton levels by adding neu-<lb/>trons from N = Z towards larger N/Z values within a full <lb/>major shell is related to the trivial (2j+1) weighting factor <lb/>of eq. (2) that always favours j  &lt;  over j  &gt;  energetically as <lb/>discussed for proton states along the Sn isotopes. The op-<lb/>posite holds for neutron levels when protons are removed <lb/>towards larger N/Z along isotonic chains. This is not in <lb/>contradiction to the recently observed SO reduction along <lb/> N = 82 from <lb/> 144  Sm to <lb/> 132  Sn [28], as this covers only the <lb/>lowest π1d  5/2  and π0g  7/2  part of the Z = 50–82 proton <lb/>shell leaving aside the effect by the π1d  3/2  and π0h  11/2 <lb/> orbitals. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4 Towards <lb/> 78 Ni <lb/> 4.1 From <lb/> 48 Ca to <lb/> 78 Ni <lb/> The heaviest nucleus with doubly-magic features and an <lb/> ls-closed HO neutron shell is <lb/> 68  Ni at N = 40. The neu-<lb/>tron shell gap has been discussed in many publications and <lb/>was found to be small and to disappear at more than two <lb/>nucleons distance from <lb/> 68  Ni [9,27,29,30]. This can be un-<lb/>derstood within the framework of the scenarios shown in <lb/>sect. 3 and fig. 5. Towards the neutron-rich Ca isotopes the <lb/>removal of πf  7/2  protons will release the νf  5/2  neutrons <lb/>to close the N = 40 gap. Experimentally deformation was <lb/>observed already in <lb/> 66,67  Fe [27,31] and <lb/> 64  Cr would corre-<lb/>spond to <lb/> 32  Mg one major shell lower. The N = 40 gap <lb/>according to this scenario would shift to N = 32, 34 in the <lb/>Ca isotopes. Recently relativistic Coulomb excitation ex-<lb/>periments were performed on the N = 32, 34 Cr [32] and <lb/>Ti [33] isotopes. In both cases clear evidence for a N = 32 <lb/>subshell was observed in the B(E2, 2 <lb/> + <lb/> → 0 <lb/> +  ) transition <lb/>strength, which corroborates an earlier conclusion from <lb/>excited states in <lb/> 54  Ti [34]. On the other hand evidence for <lb/>the N = 34 closure was not seen and it may develop only <lb/>in the Ca isotopes. <lb/>Beyond <lb/> 68  Ni the doubly-magic N = 50 nucleus <lb/> 78  Ni <lb/>has been the subject of numerous experimental studies <lb/>with respect to the persistence of the N = 50 shell and <lb/>its relevance for the astrophysics r-path. Early β-decay re-<lb/>sults seem to indicate a substantial shell quenching [35], <lb/>while in-beam experiments on N ∼ 50 Ge-Se isotopes [36] <lb/>and isomer studies following fragmentation [37,38,39,40] <lb/>give evidence for the persistence of the N = 50 shell. De-<lb/>cisive for both the Z = 28 and N = 50 shell gaps in <lb/> 78  Ni <lb/>is according to the tensor force scenario sketched on the <lb/>right hand side of fig. 5 the monopole part of the spin-<lb/>flip Δl = 1 π0f  5/2  ν0g  9/2  pair of nucleons. In Ni isotopes <lb/>(Z = 28) beyond N = 40 by filling of the ν0g  9/2  shell <lb/>the π0f  5/2  orbit is bound more strongly than the adja-<lb/>cent π1p  3/2  and π0f  7/2  and eventually crosses the π1p  3/2 <lb/> to enter the shell gap. This was experimentally observed <lb/>up to N = 44 in the β decay of odd-A Ni isotopes [41]. <lb/>Governed by the same monopole, along N = 50 the re-<lb/>moval of π0f  5/2  protons will release the ν0g  9/2  stronger <lb/>than ν1d  5/2  which will reduce the gap. Recent shell model <lb/>extrapolations of the Z = 28 and N = 50 shell gaps from <lb/> 68  Ni and <lb/> 90  Zr, respectively, to <lb/> 78  Ni yielded persistence of <lb/>the proton and neutron shell gaps with ∼ 5.1 MeV (see <lb/>fig. 5) and ∼ 3.5 MeV, respectively [6]. This is in agree-<lb/>ment with experimental evidence on the persistence of <lb/> ν0g <lb/> 2 <lb/>9/2  seniority isomerism from N = 42 ( <lb/> 70  Ni) to N = 48 <lb/>( <lb/> 78  Zn, <lb/> 76  Ni) [37,38,39,40] and the N = 50 shell strength <lb/>in Ge isotopes [36]. The inferred <lb/> 78  Ni shell gaps along <lb/>with the recently determined empirical T = 1 interaction <lb/>and single particle (hole) energies for the N = 50 isotones <lb/>and Ni isotopes [42] provide a new bench mark for tun-<lb/>ing the monopole interaction in the <lb/> 48  Ca to <lb/> 78  Ni model <lb/>space. In the lower right panel of fig. 7 the experimental <lb/> E2 strengths B(E2; 8 <lb/> + <lb/> → 6 <lb/> +  ) in the Ni isotopes beyond <lb/> N = 40 are compared to recent shell model results in the <lb/>full (0f  5/2  , 1p, 0g  9/2  ) model space [42]. The shell model <lb/>accounts very well for the observed E2 strength and the <lb/>disappearance of the I <lb/> π  = 8 <lb/> +  isomerism in <lb/> 72,74  Ni [43,44], <lb/>which is intimately connected to the low I <lb/> π  = 2 <lb/> +  excita-<lb/>tion energies [9,43], i.e. a strongly bound νg <lb/> 2 <lb/>9/2  ; I <lb/> π  = 2 <lb/> + <lb/> two-body matrix element. As a consequence in the νg <lb/> n <lb/> 9/2 <lb/> multiplet for n = 4, 6 the seniority v = 4 are more <lb/>strongly bound which opens a new 8 <lb/> +  , v = 2 → 6 <lb/> +  , v = 4 <lb/> Δv = 2 decay channel with a large E2 strength as shown <lb/>in fig. 7, lower right panel. The microscopic origin of the <lb/>low I <lb/> π  = 2 <lb/> +  excitation energy, which is experimentally <lb/>verified in <lb/> 70–76  Ni [37,44,40], can be ascribed to a reduc-<lb/>tion of the π0f SO splitting and the Z = 28 shell gap due <lb/>to the strong tensor force νg  9/2  πf monopole as discussed <lb/>in sect. 3 and fig. 5 [4]. The deviation of the E2 trend in <lb/>the heavy Ni isotopes from their N = 50 valence mirror <lb/>nuclei will be discussed in sect. 4.2. <lb/> 4.2 Valence mirrors and break-down of the seniority <lb/>scheme <lb/> In fig. 7 experimental and shell model E2 transition <lb/>strengths for the N &gt; 40 even Ni isotopes are compared <lb/>to their g <lb/> n <lb/> 9/2  valence mirror N = 50 isotones. Shell model <lb/>calculations were performed with a new empirical interac-<lb/>tion in the full T = 1 (0f  5/2  , 1p, 0g  9/2  ) neutron respective <lb/>proton model space [42]. The conclusions from the com-<lb/>parison in fig. 7 can be summarised as follows: <lb/> – The B(E2) values for the yrast states do not show <lb/>any mirror symmetry in the n = 4, 6 midshell nuclei. <lb/>Nevertheless the v = 2, 4 states in the Ni isotopes have <lb/>good seniority. <lb/> – The agreement for Δv = 0 transitions of yrast states <lb/>is excellent. <lb/> – The B(E2; 2 <lb/> + <lb/> → 0 <lb/> +  ) in <lb/> 70  Ni is largely underestimated <lb/>in the shell model [45]. This is further evidence that <lb/>the Z = 28 shell gap is soft against proton core exci-<lb/>tation due to a monopole driven shell quenching (see <lb/>sect. 4.1). As the N = 50 isotones have different neu-<lb/>tron shell structure the valence mirror <lb/> 92  Mo is affected <lb/>only marginally by core excitation (upper left panel in <lb/>fig. 7). <lb/> – The B(E2; 4 <lb/> + <lb/> → 2 <lb/> +  ) in the n = 4, 6 N = 50 isotones <lb/> 94  Ru and <lb/> 96  Pd cannot be reproduced in the T = 1 <lb/>shell model approach [46]. It can be shown that this <lb/>is a general feature of all calculations in a pure pro-<lb/>ton space [47]. On the other hand the large scale shell <lb/>model as described in sect. 2 without further modi-<lb/>fication can describe these transitions if up to 4p4h <lb/>excitations across N = 50 are included (dashed line <lb/>in fig. 7). The core excitations mix proton and neu-<lb/>trons and hence cause the breakdown of the senior-<lb/>ity scheme by mixing v = 2, 4 configurations in the <lb/> I <lb/> π  = 4 <lb/> +  state [47]. <lb/> 5 Shell structure along the r-path towards <lb/>N  Z <lb/> The success of the concept of monopole driven shell struc-<lb/>ture especially for the partially quenched N = 50 shell <lb/></body>

E2 transition strengths within the g <lb/> n <lb/> 9/2  configuration in even Ni isotopes (lower panel) and the N = 50 valence mirror <lb/>partners (upper panel). <lb/> at <lb/> 78  Ni, raises the question whether this could provide a <lb/>possible scenario to understand the r-path abundance de-<lb/>ficiency trough below the A  130 peak in astrophysical <lb/>network calculations [48]. Quenching of the N = 82 shell <lb/>due to a softening of the neutron potential as described <lb/>in the introduction [2] has been invoked to explain this <lb/>abundance deficiency [48] and experimental evidence for <lb/>a reduced shell gap for N = 82, Z ≤ 50 has been pre-<lb/>sented [49,50]. While the nuclear structure origin of the <lb/>astrophysics problem is still controversial, it might be ap-<lb/>propriate to also look into alternative structure scenarios. <lb/>In essence a reduced N = 82 shell gap causes increased ex-<lb/>citation of neutrons into orbitals beyond N = 82 leading <lb/>eventually to deformation. As a consequence the β-decay <lb/> halflives at the previous waiting points become shorter due <lb/>to larger Q  β  values while they are increased for smaller <lb/>neutron numbers due to the delayed filling of the ν0g  7/2 <lb/> subshell which is the key orbital for the ν0g  7/2  → ν0g  9/2 <lb/> allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transition. <lb/>The relevant r-path nuclei are found below <lb/> 132  Sn at <lb/> Z ≤ 50 with the single neutron states playing the key <lb/>rôle. The evolution of the neutron hole states is governed <lb/>by the same π0g  9/2  νj interaction [24] as for the neutron <lb/>particles along N = 50 as shown in fig. 4 (MHJ) except <lb/>for a renormalisation due to the different shell model core, <lb/>which in the simplest case is an A <lb/> −1/3  scaling. In the left <lb/>panel of fig. 8 the evolution of the N = 51 neutron levels <lb/>according to eq. (2) is shown with this interaction. The <lb/>right panel shows the evolution of the N = 81 neutron <lb/>hole states with an interaction as determined for a <lb/> 132  Sn <lb/>core [6,24]. Starting points are the experimental values <lb/>adopted for <lb/> 132  Sn [8,9]. It should be noted that eq. (2) <lb/>holds only for closed j <lb/>  shells, i.e. in the example of fig. 8 <lb/>for the points, provided the proton shell gap is preserved, <lb/>too. In between due to configuration mixing the trend may <lb/>deviate from the lines drawn to guide the eye. The exact <lb/>progression can be inferred from a full shell model cal-<lb/>culation (see fig. 4 for the N = 51 case). This does not <lb/>exclude a shell gap reduction due to cross shell excitations <lb/>when moving away from a doubly-magic nucleus along a <lb/>semi-magic chain of nuclei. Note that, e.g., from <lb/> 100  Sn to <lb/> 94  Ru this amounts to a ∼ 2 MeV reduction. <lb/>To validate this extrapolation it has to be proven that <lb/>the Z = 40 gap is preserved for <lb/> 122  Zr. In the upper panel <lb/>of fig. 9 the evolution of the Z = 40 gap and the adjacent <lb/>single proton levels from N = 50 to 82 is shown. The real-<lb/>istic interaction based on the CD Bonn potential is iden-<lb/>tical with the one denoted by MHJ in fig. 4, derived for a <lb/> 88  Sr core [24]. The results according to eq. (2) are drawn <lb/>by dashed lines. It is obvious that the experimental points <lb/>known until N = 64 are not well reproduced. The inter-<lb/>action fails in two details: i) it reverses the ν0g  7/2  -1d  5/2 <lb/></body>

Shell evolution along N = 50 (left) and N = 82 (right) isotones with the (MHJ) realistic interaction for <lb/> 88  Sr and <lb/> 100  Sn <lb/>core, respectively. The interactions for the νg  9/2  orbit below N = 50 is from an empirical fit [7, 23] and for the νf  7/2  orbit above <lb/> N = 82 from extrapolation from the <lb/> 208  Pb region [6]. <lb/> sequence in <lb/> 101  Sn (see fig. 4); ii) it calculates the excita-<lb/>tion energy of the I <lb/> π  = 1/2 <lb/> −  isomer in <lb/> 103  In much too <lb/>high relative to the I <lb/> π  = 9/2 <lb/> +  ground state [51]. These <lb/>excitation energies are shown in the lower panel of fig. 9. <lb/>Both deficiencies can be cured by tuning the πg  9/2  -νg  7/2 <lb/> and πp  1/2  -νd  5/2  monopoles. The results for the shell gap <lb/>are shown by full lines in the upper panel and by a full <lb/>line circle in the lower panel next to the experimental <lb/> 103  In <lb/>point (SM). Due to lacking experimental information the <lb/>monopoles involving the πp  3/2  , f  5/2  were not corrected. <lb/>The features of the Z = 40 shell extrapolation are sum-<lb/>marised as follows: <lb/> – In spite of the qualitative character of the extrapola-<lb/>tion by using eq. (2) instead of an involved shell model <lb/>calculation, the experimental shell gap is well repro-<lb/>duced. Especially the stabilisation from <lb/> 90  Zr (N = 50) <lb/>to <lb/> 96  Zr (N = 56) and the following quenching towards <lb/>the strongly deformed region <lb/> 100–104  Zr is accounted <lb/>for. <lb/> – Beyond N = 64 upon filling of the ν2s  1/2  , 0h  11/2  , 1d  3/2 <lb/> orbitals the gap is widening again to reach ∼ 4.35 MeV <lb/>at N = 82, which has to be compared to 3.198 MeV <lb/>and 4.036 MeV at N = 50 and 56, respectively. The <lb/> N = 82 ( <lb/> 122  Zr) value is an upper limit, as the inter-<lb/>action derived for <lb/> 88  Sr was not scaled by A <lb/> −1/3  which <lb/>yields a 10% reduction. The weakness of this extrapo-<lb/>lation is the lack of any experimental verification. <lb/> – Exploiting the above-mentioned sensitivity of the ex-<lb/>citation energy of the I <lb/> π  = 1/2 <lb/> −  isomer in <lb/> 103  In to the <lb/>tuning of the interaction, in the lower panel of fig. 9 <lb/>these excitation energies are shown for all In isotopes. <lb/>A clear correlation of this energy with the width of the <lb/>shell gap is seen up to N = 64. Beyond the minimum <lb/>at N ∼ 64 the values are rising again as predicted <lb/>by the shell gap extrapolation. The trend is stopped, <lb/>however, at N = 78 which casts some doubt on the pre-<lb/>dicted persistence of the Z = 40 shell gap. It should be <lb/>noted though that the last three points are results of <lb/> β-endpoint mass measurements. Recent mass measure-<lb/>ments using ion traps in neutron-rich Sr-Ru isotopes <lb/>revealed up to ∼ 1 MeV discrepancies as compared to <lb/> β-endpoint results [52]. <lb/> – We note in passing that the Z = 40 shell gap ex-<lb/>trapolation including the trend in the In probe does <lb/>not show any sign of double-magicity for the Z = 40, <lb/> N = 70 nucleus <lb/> 110  Zr. <lb/>In conclusion the persistence of the Z = 40 gap at <lb/> N = 82 is still an open question. So a possible quenching of <lb/>the N = 82 gap may find a simple explanation in the lack <lb/>of the Z = 40 gap, which would make <lb/> 122  Zr a mid-shell <lb/>nucleus with reduced neutron gap due to ph excitations <lb/>across the shell. <lb/>An alternative scenario for filling the abundance <lb/>trough below A  130 is based on the steep upsloping <lb/>of the νg  7/2  level from the deepest in the shell at <lb/> 132  Sn to <lb/>the Fermi surface at <lb/> 122  Zr as shown in fig. 8 right panel. <lb/>The allowed GT transition is delayed as the ν0g  7/2  starts <lb/>to be filled only about 12 nucleons below N = 82 thus <lb/></body>

The strong proton-neutron inter-<lb/>action in identical orbitals at N = Z gives rise to spin-gap <lb/>isomers exhibiting exotic decay modes such as p and 2p <lb/>decay. An indispensable prerequisite for sound predictions <lb/>are readily available large scale shell model codes along <lb/>with realistic interactions that in their monopole part are <lb/>well adjusted to experimental single particle energies. This <lb/>does not necessarily hamper the predictive power of shell <lb/>model calculations as the tuning can be done in regions <lb/>accessible to detailed spectroscopy (see sects. 2 and 5). <lb/>Monopole driven shell evolution can account for many as-<lb/>pects of structural changes on the pathway from proton-<lb/>rich N ∼ Z nuclei ( <lb/> 100  Sn) to the neutron-rich N  Z <lb/> ( <lb/> 78  Ni) region. The concept has been shown to account for <lb/>the new shell closures established in light nuclei, shell re-<lb/>ordering and evolution of spin-orbit splitting in medium-<lb/>heavy nuclei, and it provides an alternative access to the <lb/>structure of N  Z r-path nuclei. <lb/> The authors enjoyed illuminating discussions with F.

It has been realised recently that charge symmetry of the nucleon-nucleon interaction leads <lb/>to a certain relation between Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANCs) in mirror-conjugated one-<lb/>nucleon overlap integrals. This relation can be approximated by a simple analytical formula that involves <lb/>mirror neutron and proton separation energies, the core charge and the range of the strong nucleon-core <lb/>interaction. We perform detailed microscopic multi-channel cluster model calculations and compare their <lb/>predictions to the simple analytical formula as well as to calculations within a single-particle model in <lb/>which mirror symmetry in potential wells and spectroscopic factors are assumed. The validity of the latter <lb/>assumptions is verified on the basis of microscopic cluster model calculations. For mirror pairs in which <lb/>one of the states is above the proton decay threshold, a link exists between the proton partial width and <lb/>the ANC of the mirror neutron. This link is given by an approximate analytical formula similar to that for <lb/>a bound-bound mirror pair. We compare predictions of this formula to the results of microscopic cluster <lb/>model calculations. Mirror symmetry in ANCs can be used to predict cross sections for proton capture at <lb/>stellar energies using neutron ANCs measured with stable or &quot; less radioactive &quot; beams. <lb/> PACS. 21.60.Gx Cluster models – 21.10.Jx Spectroscopic factors – 27.20.+n 6 ≤ A ≤ 19 – 27.30.+t <lb/>20 ≤ A ≤ 38 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Over the last 15 years, the nuclear physics community <lb/>has shown a growing interest in Asymptotic Normalization <lb/>Coefficients (ANCs). The study of these coefficients, both <lb/>theoretically and experimentally, is mostly motivated by <lb/>their application to nuclear astrophysics. <lb/>The one-nucleon ANC determines the magnitude of <lb/>the large distance behaviour of the overlap integral be-<lb/>tween the bound state wave functions of nuclei A and <lb/> A − 1. Such overlaps enter the amplitude for non-resonant <lb/>nucleon capture reactions. If the capture occurs outside <lb/>the nuclear interior, as often happens at very low stel-<lb/>lar energies, then the overall normalization of its cross <lb/>sections as well as of the astrophysical S-factors, is de-<lb/>termined by the squared ANC [1]. Since the same ANCs <lb/>play a crucial role in other peripheral processes such as <lb/>transfer reactions, they can be measured in laboratories <lb/>and used to predict non-resonant capture processes at low <lb/>stellar energies [1]. <lb/> a  e-mail: n.timofeyuk@surrey.ac.uk <lb/> It has been suggested recently in ref. [2] that the ANCs <lb/>of two mirror overlap integrals should be related if the <lb/>charge symmetry of nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions <lb/>is valid. It has been shown there that mirror ANCs can <lb/>be linked by an approximate analytical expression which <lb/>contains only nucleon separation energies, charges of the <lb/>product nuclei and the range of the strong interaction be-<lb/>tween the last nucleon and the core. This link can be used <lb/>to predict cross sections for non-resonant proton capture if <lb/>mirror neutron ANCs are known. The latter can be deter-<lb/>mined using direct reactions in experiments with stable <lb/>beams. Such experiments are less difficult and more ac-<lb/>curate than ones involving radioactive beams which are <lb/>necessary to determine the proton ANCs. <lb/>According to ref. [2], if one of the mirror nuclear states <lb/>is a low-lying narrow proton resonance, and its mirror ana-<lb/>log is particle-stable, then a link should exist between the <lb/>width of the proton decaying state and the neutron ANC <lb/>of its mirror analog. This link is given by an approximate <lb/>analytical formula which is similar to that for the case of <lb/>bound mirror pairs. <lb/>A proper understanding of the link between the width <lb/>of a proton resonance and the neutron ANC of its mirror <lb/></body>

			<body> analog can be important for predicting the resonant pro-<lb/>ton capture rates for a particular class of resonant reac-<lb/>tions at stellar energies. This class includes reactions that <lb/>proceed via very narrow isolated states for which the pro-<lb/>ton width Γ  p  is either comparable to or much less than its <lb/> γ-decay width Γ  γ  . Such resonances can be found in the <lb/>neutron-deficient region of the sd and pf shells (for ex-<lb/>ample, some levels in <lb/> 25  Si, <lb/> 27  P, <lb/> 33  Ar, <lb/> 36  K and <lb/> 43,46  V) and <lb/>their study is important for understanding nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis in the rp process. For the resonances mentioned above <lb/> Γ  p  can be less than 1 eV. Direct measurements of such <lb/>tiny widths using proton elastic scattering are impossible. <lb/>Proton transfer reactions can be used instead. They pro-<lb/>vide spectroscopic factors which are combined with the <lb/>single-particle widths to get the necessary partial proton <lb/>widths. However, uncertainties in Γ  p  extracted through <lb/>theoretical analysis of these reactions (for example, using <lb/>the distorted-wave formalism) are about 50% [3]. These <lb/>uncertainties arise due to problems in the theoretical anal-<lb/>ysis of stripping reactions to the continuum and the deter-<lb/>mination of the single-particle proton widths. The deter-<lb/>mination of proton widths based on the link to ANCs of <lb/>their mirror particle-stable analogs can provide better ac-<lb/>curacy since it avoids the uncertainties mentioned above. <lb/>In the present paper, we compare three different calcu-<lb/>lations of the ratio between mirror ANCs of bound mirror <lb/>pairs and two calculations for the ratio between the pro-<lb/>ton widths and neutron ANCs of their mirror analogs. The <lb/>first calculation uses the analytical formulae of ref. [2]. The <lb/>second one (applied here only for bound mirror pairs) is <lb/>based on the idea of mirror symmetry of single-particle <lb/>potential wells and of spectroscopic factors. The third <lb/>method uses the microscopic calculations within a multi-<lb/>channel cluster model. These three approaches are de-<lb/>scribed in sect. 2, 3 and 4. The comparison between them <lb/>is given in sect. 5 and 6 and discussed in sect. 7. <lb/> 2 Analytical formula <lb/> 2.1 Bound mirror pairs <lb/> The ANC C  lj  for the one-nucleon virtual decay A → (A − <lb/> 1) + N is defined via the tail of the overlap integral I  lj  (r) <lb/> I  lj  (r) = <lb/> χ  1 <lb/> 2  τ <lb/> Y  l  (ˆ r) ⊗ χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> j <lb/> ⊗ Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/> JA <lb/> |Ψ <lb/> JA <lb/> (1) <lb/>between the many-body wave functions Ψ <lb/> JA  and Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/> of nuclei A and A − 1. Here l is the orbital momentum, <lb/> j is the total relative angular momentum between A − 1 <lb/>and N , τ is the isospin projection and χ  1 <lb/>2  τ  is the isospin <lb/>wave function of nucleon N , and r is the distance between <lb/> N and the center-of-mass of A − 1. Asymptotically, this <lb/>overlap behaves as <lb/> √ <lb/> A I  lj  (r) ≈ C  lj <lb/> W  −η,l+1/2  (2κr) <lb/> r <lb/>, r → ∞, <lb/> (2) <lb/>where κ = (2μμ/¯ h <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 1/2  ,  is the one-nucleon separation <lb/>energy, η = Z  A−1  Z  N  e <lb/> 2  μ/¯ h <lb/> 2  κ, μ is the reduced mass for <lb/>the (A − 1) + N system and W is the Whittaker function. <lb/>For the <lb/> A−1 <lb/>N −1  Z ⊗ n| <lb/> A <lb/>N  Z overlap, where the separated <lb/>nucleon is a neutron, the ANC C  lj  can be represented by <lb/>the matrix element [4,5,6]: <lb/> C  lj  = −i <lb/> −l  2μ <lb/> √ <lb/> A <lb/> ¯ h <lb/> 2 <lb/> × <lb/> χ  1 <lb/>2  τ <lb/> j  l  (iκr)Y  l  (ˆ r) ⊗ χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> j <lb/> ⊗ Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/> JA <lb/> nucl <lb/> Ψ <lb/> JA <lb/> , (3) <lb/>where j  l  (iκr) is the spherical Bessel function, <lb/>ˆ <lb/> V <lb/> nucl  = <lb/> A−1  <lb/> i=1 <lb/> V  NN  (|r  i  − r  A  |) , <lb/> (4) <lb/> V  NN  is the strong two-body NN potential and r  i  is the <lb/>radius-vector of the i-th nucleon. <lb/>For the mirror overlap <lb/> A−1 <lb/>Z−1  N ⊗ p| <lb/> A <lb/>Z  N , where the sep-<lb/>arated nucleon is a proton, the expression for the ANC <lb/> C  lj  can be obtained by considering the inhomogeneous <lb/>coupled system of differential equations <lb/>  p  + ˆ <lb/> T <lb/> rel <lb/>l <lb/> + <lb/> n   l   j  <lb/> V <lb/> coul <lb/>nlj,n   l   j   (r) <lb/> I  n   l   j   (r) <lb/>= − <lb/> χ  1 <lb/>2  τ <lb/> Y  l  (ˆ r) ⊗ χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> j <lb/> ⊗ Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/> JA <lb/> nucl <lb/> Ψ <lb/> JA <lb/> , (5) <lb/>which is easily obtained from the simultaneous considera-<lb/>tion of the Schrödinger equations for nuclei A and A − 1 <lb/>and expanding the wave function of A into complete set <lb/>of eigenfunctions Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>n <lb/> of the Hamiltonian H  A−1  for the <lb/>core A − 1. In eq. (5) V <lb/> coul <lb/>nlj,n   l   j   (r) is the matrix element of <lb/>the Coulomb interaction between the last proton and the <lb/>protons of the core A − 1: <lb/> V <lb/> coul <lb/>nlj,n   l   j   (r) = <lb/> Y  l  (ˆ r) ⊗ χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> j <lb/> ⊗ Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>n <lb/> JA <lb/> × <lb/> A−1  <lb/> i=1 <lb/> e  i  e  A <lb/> r  iA <lb/> Y  l   (ˆ r) ⊗ χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> j   ⊗ Ψ <lb/> J <lb/> A−1 <lb/> n  <lb/> JA <lb/> . (6) <lb/>Here n denotes an excited state of A − 1, e  i  is the charge <lb/>of i-th nucleon and r  iA  = |r  i  − r  A  |. <lb/> If non-diagonal Coulomb couplings in eq. (5) can be <lb/>neglected and the diagonal Coulomb potential is replaced <lb/>by a function V <lb/> coul <lb/>mod  (r) which is a constant V <lb/> coul <lb/>mod  (r) = <lb/>  n  −  p  inside the Coulomb radius, and (Z −1)e <lb/> 2  /r outside <lb/>it, then the proton ANC is given by the same expression <lb/>as eq. (3) but in which the Bessel function is replaced <lb/>by the solution ϕ <lb/> mod <lb/>l <lb/> (r) of the Schrödinger equation with <lb/>the potential V <lb/> coul <lb/>mod  (r). Since the main contribution to the <lb/>ANC comes from internal nuclear region, we need to know <lb/> ϕ <lb/> mod <lb/>l <lb/> (r) only at r &lt; R  N  (R  N  is the radius of the nuclear <lb/>interior). In this region it is given by the expression [2] <lb/> ϕ <lb/> mod <lb/>l <lb/> (r) = <lb/> F  l  (iκ  p  R  N  ) <lb/> κ  p  R  N  j  l  (iκ  n  R  N  ) <lb/> j  l  (iκ  n  r), r ≤ R  N  , <lb/> (7) <lb/>in which iκ  p  and iκ  n  are determined by the proton and <lb/>neutron separation energies  p  and  n  , and F  l  is the regular <lb/>Coulomb wave function at imaginary momentum iκ. <lb/></body>

			<body> If the charge symmetry of NN interactions is valid, <lb/>then the wave functions of the mirror pairs <lb/> A <lb/> Z  N -<lb/> A <lb/>N  Z and <lb/> A−1 <lb/>N −1  Z -<lb/> A−1 <lb/>Z−1  N should be approximately the same in the <lb/>nuclear interior and the ratio <lb/> R = <lb/> C  p <lb/> C  n <lb/>  2 <lb/> , <lb/> (8) <lb/>where C  p  and C  n  are proton and neutron ANCs for mirror <lb/>nucleon decays, should be approximated by the square of <lb/>the normalization coefficient in function ϕ <lb/> mod <lb/>l <lb/> (r): <lb/> R ≈ R  0  ≡ <lb/> F  l  (iκ  p  R  N  ) <lb/> κ  p  R  N  j  l  (iκ  n  R  N  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (9) <lb/> 2.2 Bound-unbound mirror pairs <lb/> It has been shown in ref. [7] that the partial width Γ  p  of <lb/>a narrow proton resonance is related to the single-particle <lb/>ANC b  p  of the Gamow function describing the proton mo-<lb/>tion in the resonance state times the spectroscopic factor <lb/> S  p  : Γ  p  = (¯ h <lb/> 2  κ  p  /μ)S  p  b <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  . One can show that S <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> l <lb/> b  p  can be <lb/>represented by an integral containing the wave functions <lb/>of nuclei A and A − 1 and the interaction potential be-<lb/>tween the proton and A − 1 in the same way as for bound <lb/>nuclear states. Assuming that the Gamow function in the <lb/>internal region of the resonance is the same as the internal <lb/>wave function of its mirror stable analog and repeating the <lb/>reasoning of the previous section, we get for <lb/> R  Γ  = Γ  p  /C <lb/> 2 <lb/> n  , <lb/> (10) <lb/>an approximate expression [2] <lb/> R  Γ  ≈ R <lb/> res <lb/> 0 <lb/> = <lb/>¯ h <lb/> 2  κ  p <lb/> μ <lb/> F  l  (κ  p  R  N  ) <lb/> κ  p  R  N  j  l  (iκ  n  R  N  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (11) <lb/>In eq. (10) C  n  is the neutron ANC of the proton mirror <lb/>bound analog. We would like to stress that the width Γ  p <lb/> entering eq. (11) is a residue in the S-matrix pole at the <lb/>energy of the proton resonance and not the width for the <lb/>cross sections of resonant reactions. However, for narrow <lb/>resonances the difference between these two definitions of <lb/>the width is small. <lb/> 3 Single-particle model <lb/> According to the analytical formula, the ratio of mirror <lb/>ANCs should depend only on nucleon separation ener-<lb/>gies and should be independent of the NN potentials. We <lb/>checked this property for the case of the two-body model. <lb/>We considered a family of Woods-Saxon potentials that <lb/>give some chosen neutron separation energy  n  , and some <lb/>chosen proton separation energy  p  when the Coulomb <lb/>potential of a uniformly charged sphere was added.

Unlike R  0  , R  s.p.  takes into account the differences <lb/>in internal wave functions of mirror nuclei due to the <lb/>Coulomb interaction. <lb/>In fig. 2 we compare the ratio R  s.p.  with the analytical <lb/>estimate R  0  . One can see that R  0  reproduces the general <lb/>trend in R  s.p.  well. The difference between them is about <lb/>2–6% for relatively large proton separation energies but <lb/>can reach 10–20% for <lb/> 8  B, <lb/> 17  F( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) and <lb/> 15  O( <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) where <lb/>this energy becomes very small. <lb/> 4 Microscopic cluster model <lb/> To understand the validity of simple approxima-<lb/>tions (9), (11) and (12), their predictions should be <lb/>compared to the numerical calculations using theoretical <lb/>structure models. One of the models, the best adapted for <lb/>ANC calculations, is a microscopic cluster model. <lb/>The multi-channel cluster wave function for a nucleus <lb/> A consisting of a core A − 1 and a nucleon N can be <lb/>represented as follows: <lb/> Ψ <lb/> JAMA  = <lb/> lSJA−1ω <lb/> A[χ  1 <lb/> 2  τ  [g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS  (r)⊗[Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ω <lb/> ⊗χ  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ]  S  ]  JAMA  ], <lb/>(13) <lb/>where A = A <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (1 − <lb/>  A−1 <lb/>i=1  P  i,A  ) and the operator P  i,A <lb/> permutes spatial and spin-isospin coordinates of the i-<lb/> th and A-th nucleons. In this work, Ψ <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ω <lb/> is a wave <lb/>function of nucleus A − 1 with the angular momentum <lb/> J  A−1  defined either in the translation-invariant harmonic-<lb/>oscillator shell model, or in a multicluster model. The <lb/>quantum number ω labels states with the same angular <lb/>momentum J  A−1  and S is the channel spin. Transition <lb/>from the lS coupling scheme to the lj coupling scheme <lb/>can be done using standard techniques. <lb/>The relative wave function g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS  (r) = g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS  (r) Y  lm  (ˆ r) <lb/> is determined using the R-matrix method. In this method, <lb/>as explained in detail in ref. [8], the Bloch-Shrödinger <lb/>equation is solved for the wave function Ψ <lb/> JAMA  , which <lb/>allows the correct asymptotic behaviour for the relative <lb/>wave function g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS <lb/> to be obtained. For the states that <lb/>are stable with respect to particle decay this behaviour is <lb/> g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS  (r) ≈ C <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS <lb/> W  −η,l+1/2  (2κr) <lb/> r <lb/> (14) <lb/>and for particle-unstable states <lb/> g <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ωlS  (r) ≈ A  ω <lb/> δ  ων  I  ν  (κ  ν  r) − U <lb/> JA−1 <lb/>ων <lb/> O  ν  (κ  ν  r) <lb/>κ  ω  v <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> ν <lb/> . <lb/> (15) <lb/>Here, I  ν  and O  ν  are the ingoing and outgoing Coulomb <lb/>functions, v  ν  is the velocity in the channel ν and U is the <lb/>collision matrix. The resonance width is determined by as-<lb/>suming a Breit-Wigner shape for the collision matrix near <lb/>an isolated resonance. This width is the residue at the <lb/>pole of the R-matrix and its ratio to the ANC squared of <lb/>the mirror neutron can be compared to the approxima-<lb/>tion (11). <lb/> 8  B <lb/> 12 <lb/> N <lb/> 13 <lb/> N <lb/> 15 <lb/> O gs <lb/>15 <lb/> O( 3 / 2 <lb/>+ <lb/> ) <lb/> 17 <lb/> F gs <lb/>17 <lb/> F( 1 / 2 <lb/>+ ) <lb/> 23 <lb/> Al <lb/> 27 <lb/> P <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>1.2 <lb/> R <lb/> MCM /R <lb/> s.p. or R <lb/> MCM /R <lb/> 0 <lb/> R  MCM /R  s.p. <lb/> R  MCM /R  0 <lb/> Fig. 3.

For the <lb/> 13  C-<lb/> 13  N <lb/>mirror pair the circles represent the calculations within the <lb/>four-cluster model and the downward triangles represent the <lb/>calculations in the two-cluster model for various nuclei. <lb/> 5 Bound mirror pairs <lb/> In this section we calculate mirror one-body overlap inte-<lb/>grals for several 0p and sd shell nuclei within the multi-<lb/>channel cluster model and explore their properties such <lb/>as ANCs, spectroscopic factors and single-particle ANCs. <lb/>The residual nucleus is always taken in its ground state. <lb/>We use the best adapted effective NN interactions for <lb/>such calculations, namely, the Volkov potential V2 [9] and <lb/>the Minnesota (MN) potential [10]. The two-body spin-<lb/>orbit force [11] and the Coulomb interaction are also in-<lb/>cluded. More details of the calculations can be found in <lb/>ref. [12] and references therein. <lb/>Each of V2 and MN have one adjustable parameter <lb/>that gives the strength of the odd NN potentials V  11  and <lb/> V  33  . This parameter is usually fitted to reproduce the ex-<lb/>perimental separation energy for neutron or proton. Such <lb/>a procedure is crucial for theoretical calculations of ANCs. <lb/>However, in most cases the same choice of this parame-<lb/>ter for mirror states does not reproduce both neutron and <lb/>proton separation energies. Therefore, we use slightly dif-<lb/>ferent interactions in mirror nuclei to reproduce simulta-<lb/>neously the separations energies for neutrons and protons. <lb/>This simulates charge symmetry breaking of the effec-<lb/>tive NN interactions that should be a consequence of the <lb/>charge symmetry breaking in realistic NN interactions. <lb/> 5.1 Mirror symmetry in ANCs <lb/> In this section we compare the ratio R  MCM  of mirror <lb/>ANCs squared obtained in the microscopic cluster model <lb/>with two different approximations, R  0  and R  s.p.  . The ra-<lb/>tios R  MCM  calculated with two different NN potentials <lb/>differed by no more than 4%. So, we use for R  MCM  the <lb/>result averaged over two potentials V2 and MN. The cal-<lb/>culated ratio R  MCM  /R  0  and R  MCM  /R  s.p.  are shown in <lb/>fig. 3 for several mirror pairs. The error bars in this figure <lb/>are due to averaging R  MCM  over the two NN potentials <lb/>and because of uncertainties in R  0  due to the choice of R  N <lb/></body>

			<body> and the uncertainties in R  s.p.  due to the residual depen-<lb/>dence on the nucleon-core potential. Where two different <lb/>values of the channel spin are possible, we take the sum <lb/>of the squared ANCs in these channels for each of mirror <lb/>nuclei and construct their ratio. In nuclear astrophysics <lb/>the sum of the squared ANCs is often needed rather than <lb/>their individual values in channels with different spin. <lb/>For the mirror pair <lb/> 13  C-<lb/> 13  N, two models were used: a <lb/>two-cluster model (downward triangles) and a four clus-<lb/>ter model (circles). The slightly different ratios R  MCM <lb/> obtained in these models are due to the different amount <lb/>of charge symmetry breaking required in each of these <lb/>models. <lb/>According to fig. 3, the deviation of R  MCM  from the <lb/>analytical value R  0  does not exceed 7% for most cases <lb/>except for the two s-wave mirror states with one node <lb/> 15  N( <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  )-<lb/> 15  O( <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) and <lb/> 17  O( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  )-<lb/> 17  F( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) and for the mir-<lb/>ror pair <lb/> 23  Ne-<lb/> 23  Al. The deviations in these cases are 10%, <lb/>13% and 12% respectively. In most cases R  MCM  is smaller <lb/>than R  0  but larger than R  s.p.  . The deviation of R  s.p.  from <lb/> R  MCM  is not more than 6% except for the <lb/> 23  Ne-<lb/> 23  Al and <lb/> 27  Mg-<lb/> 27  P mirror pairs where these deviations are 10% and <lb/>12%, respectively. <lb/>We have found that the average R  av  of two differ-<lb/>ent approximations R  0  and R  g.s.  is in reasonably good <lb/>agreement with R  MCM  . For all cases except <lb/> 23  Ne-<lb/> 23  Al the <lb/>difference between R  av  and R  MCM  does not exceed 6%. <lb/>Therefore, in the absence of detailed microscopic calcula-<lb/>tions R  av  can be a good choice for using mirror symmetry <lb/>in ANCs to predict proton ANCs from mirror neutron ones <lb/>and vice versa. <lb/>The 10–12% difference between R  0  (or R  s.p.  ) and <lb/> R  MCM  for the mirror pair <lb/> 23  Ne-<lb/> 23  Al arises due to strong <lb/>core excitation effects. This deviation occurs in multichan-<lb/>nel calculations which include many excited states in the <lb/> 22  Ne and <lb/> 22  Mg cores. When all the core excitations are <lb/>removed, the calculated value of R  MCM  decreases and <lb/>agrees with R  s.p.  and R  0  within 2% [12]. <lb/> 5.2 Mirror symmetry in spectroscopic factors <lb/> The spectroscopic factor S  lj  is defined as <lb/> S  lj  = A <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr r <lb/> 2  (I  lj  (r)) <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (16) <lb/>and we obtain them by numerical integration of the over-<lb/>lap integrals squared, calculated in the MCM. We use <lb/>slightly different odd NN interactions in each mirror state <lb/>in order to reproduce the experimental separation ener-<lb/>gies both for neutrons and protons. However, these inter-<lb/>actions do not differ much and, therefore, the difference <lb/>in mirror wave functions in the nuclear interior should <lb/>arise because of the charge symmetry breaking due to the <lb/>Coulomb interactions. Since the latter are smaller then <lb/>strong interactions and because the main contribution to <lb/>the spectroscopic factor comes from nuclear interior, one <lb/>expects that the spectroscopic factors in mirror states to <lb/>be almost equal. <lb/> 8  B <lb/> 12 N <lb/> 13 N <lb/> 15 O gs <lb/>15 O( 3 / 2 <lb/>+ ) <lb/> 17 F gs <lb/>17 <lb/> F( 1 / 2 <lb/>+ ) <lb/> 23 Al <lb/> 27 P <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>S <lb/> p /S <lb/> n <lb/> V2 j=1/2 <lb/>MN j=1/2 <lb/>V2 j=3/2 <lb/>MN j=3/2 <lb/>V2 j=5/2 <lb/>MN j=5/2 <lb/>V2 S 1/2 +S 3/2 <lb/> MN S 1/2 +S 3/2 <lb/> Fig. 4. Ratio of proton to neutron spectroscopic factors for <lb/>various nuclei. <lb/> The ratio S  p  /S  n  , where S  p  is the proton spectroscopic <lb/>factor and S  n  is the spectroscopic factors for its mirror <lb/>analog, is shown in fig. 4 both for the V2 and the MN po-<lb/>tentials. In this figure, the results for <lb/> 13  N-<lb/> 13  C are shown <lb/>only for the four-cluster model. The two-cluster model pre-<lb/>dicts very similar values for S  p  /S  n  for this mirror pair. <lb/>One can see that for the mirror pairs <lb/> 13  N-<lb/> 13  C and <lb/> 17  F-<lb/> 17  O with well developed single-particle structure, S  p  /S  n <lb/> is very close to one. For most other cases the deviation of <lb/> S  p  /S  n  from one is no more than 4% for both the NN po-<lb/>tentials. The strongest deviation is obtained for the small <lb/> j = 1/2 components of the <lb/> 8  B| <lb/> 7  Be and <lb/> 8  Li| <lb/> 7  Li over-<lb/>lap integrals and it reaches about 20% for V2 and 11% <lb/>for MN potential, respectively. Such a sensitivity to the <lb/> NN potential for j = 1/2 is explained by the different <lb/>amounts of charge symmetry breaking required to repro-<lb/>duce the experimental separation energies in <lb/> 8  B and <lb/> 8  Li <lb/>with V2 and MN. Another strong deviation of S  p  /S  n  from <lb/>one occurs for the <lb/> 27  P-<lb/> 27  Mg mirror pair where it reaches <lb/>8 to 9%. This deviation arises from core excitation effects. <lb/> 5.3 Mirror symmetry in single-particle ANCs <lb/> The overlap integrals I  lj  (r), divided by the square roots <lb/>of their spectroscopic factors S  lj  , are normalised functions <lb/>of only one degree of freedom. They play the same role as <lb/>single-particle wave functions generated by some effective <lb/>local single-particle potential. These functions are charac-<lb/>terised by the single-particle ANCs b  lj  = C  lj  S <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> lj <lb/> . Com-<lb/>parison between single-particle ANCs b  lj  for mirror nuclei <lb/>may help to understand if mirror symmetry of the effective <lb/>local single-particle potential wells is valid. <lb/>In this section we compare the ratio R  b  = <lb/> C <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  S  n  /(C <lb/> 2 <lb/> n  S  p  ) calculated in the microscopic cluster <lb/>model with charge symmetry breaking and the ratio R  s.p. <lb/> obtained using the same single-particle potential well <lb/>which also reproduces experimental separation energies. If <lb/>the charge symmetry of the local effective single-particle <lb/>potentials is valid, then the ratio R  b  /R  s.p.  should be <lb/>equal to one. <lb/></body>

Ratio R  b  /Rs.p. for various nuclei. <lb/> In fig. 5 we plot the ratio R  b  /R  s.p.  . The results of <lb/>microscopic calculations for R  b  with two different NN <lb/> potentials are averaged. The error bars in this figure are <lb/>present due to this averaging and because of uncertainties <lb/>in R  s.p.  due to the residual dependence on nucleon-core <lb/>potential. <lb/>For the mirror pairs of overlap integrals <lb/> 8  B| <lb/> 7  Be-<lb/> 8  Li| <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 12  N| <lb/> 11  C-<lb/> 12  B| <lb/> 11  B, and <lb/> 15  O| <lb/> 14  N-<lb/> 15  N| <lb/> 14  N <lb/>with l = 1, where two angular momenta j are possible, <lb/>the ratio R  b  /R  s.p.  is different in channels with j = 3/2 <lb/>and j = 1/2. The deviation of R  b  /R  s.p.  from one for these <lb/>overlaps correlates with the size of their r.m.s. radii so <lb/>that the larger is the r.m.s radius, the smaller are the de-<lb/>viations. For the j = 3/2 overlaps <lb/> 8  B| <lb/> 7  Be-<lb/> 8  Li| <lb/> 7  Li and <lb/> 12  N| <lb/> 11  C-<lb/> 12  N| <lb/> 11  C r <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> j=3/2  is larger than r <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> j=1/2  [12] <lb/>and the ratio R  b  /R  s.p.  deviates from one for j = 3/2 over-<lb/>laps more than in the j = 1/2 case. The situation for the <lb/> 15  O| <lb/> 14  N-<lb/> 15  N| <lb/> 14  N mirror overlaps is opposite, the r.m.s. <lb/>radius for j = 1/2 is smaller than that for j = 3/2 and R  b <lb/> deviates from R  s.p.  more for the latter case. <lb/>For the <lb/> 13  N| <lb/> 12  C-<lb/> 13  C| <lb/> 12  C pair of mirror overlaps, <lb/>we have performed the calculations both in four-and two-<lb/>cluster models. In the first case, the mirror symmetry of <lb/>local effective potential wells is valid. In the second case, <lb/>the mirror local effective potentials are not the same due <lb/>to large charge symmetry breaking required to reproduce <lb/>the experimental separation energies. <lb/>The ratio R  b  /R  s.p.  is equal to one within the theoret-<lb/>ical uncertainties only for <lb/> 17  F  g.s.  and <lb/> 27  P. It is interest-<lb/>ing that significant deviation between R  b  and R  s.p.  can <lb/>be seen for the single-particle nuclear state <lb/> 17  F( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ), in <lb/>which the mirror symmetry of the mean field is intuitively <lb/>expected. We believe that the reason for such a deviation <lb/>is the fact that in <lb/> 17  O( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) the valence 1s neutron pene-<lb/>trates inside the core more easily than the mirror proton <lb/>thus more strongly disturbing the mean field. Also a very <lb/>strong deviation occurs for <lb/> 23  Al which should originate <lb/>from the strong deformation of the <lb/> 22  Mg core. <lb/> 8 <lb/> B <lb/> 12 <lb/> N <lb/> 12 N <lb/> 12 <lb/> N <lb/> 12 <lb/> N <lb/> 13 N <lb/> 13 <lb/> N <lb/> 13 N <lb/> 23 Al <lb/> 27 P <lb/>10 <lb/> −12 <lb/> 10 <lb/> −10 <lb/> 10 <lb/> −8 <lb/> 10 <lb/> −6 <lb/> 10 <lb/> −4 <lb/> 10 <lb/> −2 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 0 <lb/> Γ <lb/> p <lb/> /C <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> analytical formula <lb/>MCM calculations with V2 <lb/>1 <lb/> + <lb/> 2 <lb/> + <lb/> 0 <lb/> + <lb/> 2 <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/> − <lb/>1 <lb/> / 2 <lb/>+ <lb/>3 <lb/> / 2 <lb/>− <lb/>5 <lb/> / 2 <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/> / 2 <lb/>+ <lb/>3 / 2 <lb/>+ <lb/> Fig. 6.

The adjustable parameters of the <lb/> NN potentials are chosen to reproduce the experimen-<lb/>tal energies of proton resonances. We calculate the widths <lb/> Γ  p  for these resonances, the ANCs squared C <lb/> 2 <lb/> n  for mirror <lb/>neutrons and plot their ratio R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> in fig. 6 for the V2 <lb/>potential. We compare this ratio to the prediction R <lb/> res <lb/> 0 <lb/> of <lb/>the analytical formula (11). As seen in fig. 6, the analyt-<lb/>ical formula describes very well the general trend in the <lb/> R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> behaviour. The same is true for the MN potential. <lb/>To see the differences between R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> and R <lb/> res <lb/> 0 <lb/> we <lb/>have plotted in fig. 7 the ratio R <lb/> res <lb/> 0  /R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> .

The results are plotted in fig. 7. One <lb/>can see from this figure that for 0p shell nuclei the results <lb/>obtained with and without taking core excitations into <lb/>account differ by not more than 6%, except for <lb/> 12  N(0 <lb/> +  ), <lb/>where this difference is about 10%. Core excitations be-<lb/>come more important for nuclei in the middle of the sd <lb/> shell. For <lb/> 23  Ne-<lb/> 23  Al, their influence on R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> is about <lb/>12–16%.

This requires some <lb/>charge symmetry breaking in the NN interactions used. <lb/>The results of such calculations are presented in fig. 8. <lb/>The differences in the calculations with V2 and MN po-<lb/>tentials do not exceed 8% for all the cases considered here. <lb/>The largest difference between R <lb/> res <lb/> 0 <lb/> and R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> occurs, <lb/>as expected, for the s-wave resonances <lb/> 12  N(2 <lb/> −  ), <lb/> 12  N(1 <lb/> −  ) <lb/>and <lb/> 13  N( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> −  ), the widths of which are not small. For the <lb/>narrow s-wave resonance <lb/> 23  Al, R <lb/> res <lb/> 0 <lb/> deviates from R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> by about 14%. Similar deviations, of 16-18%, occur for all <lb/>the p-wave resonances. For the d-wave resonances <lb/> 13  N( <lb/> 5 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) <lb/>and <lb/> 27  P( <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+  ) this deviation is noticeably smaller, 6% and <lb/>10% respectively. <lb/> 7 Discussion and conclusions <lb/> In this paper we have performed calculations of ANCs for <lb/>mirror one-body overlap integrals within a multi-channel <lb/>microscopic cluster model. These calculations provide an <lb/>improved understanding of mirror symmetry in ANCs <lb/></body>

			<body> because the model used takes into account the differ-<lb/>ences in the internal structure of mirror nuclei due to <lb/>the Coulomb interaction and the effects that arise due <lb/>to core excitations, which were ignored in the derivation <lb/>of the analytical formula (9). Comparison of the results <lb/>obtained within the microscopic model with the predic-<lb/>tions of eq. (9) has confirmed the general trend in the <lb/>behaviour of ratio of mirror ANCs, given by this formula. <lb/>This trend is determined only by the separation energies <lb/>of mirror proton and neutron and the charges of the cores. <lb/>The difference between the microscopic calculations and <lb/>the analytical formula is usually less than 7%. However, it <lb/>may reach, 10 to 12% for the very weakly bound 1s nuclei <lb/>and for nuclei with strongly excited cores. <lb/>The microscopic calculations of the ratio of mirror <lb/>ANCs are also very close to those of the single-particle <lb/>model, where mirror symmetry in the single-particle po-<lb/>tential wells and in the spectroscopic factors is assumed. <lb/>The difference between such calculations is typically less <lb/>that 7% except for the sd shell nuclei <lb/> 23  Al and <lb/> 27  P with <lb/>strongly deformed cores. The average of the single-particle <lb/>estimate and the prediction of the analytical model is in <lb/>agreement with the microscopic calculations to within 6%, <lb/>except for <lb/> 23  Al. Therefore, this average value can be used <lb/>to predict unknown ANCs from known mirror ones when <lb/>the microscopic calculations are not available. As far as the <lb/>mirror symmetry of the single-particle model is concerned, <lb/>it is not always justified. Our microscopic calculations <lb/>have shown that spectroscopic factors in mirror states can <lb/>differ by up to 9% and that mirror symmetry in proton and <lb/>neutron potential wells is not always present, even for nu-<lb/>clear states with well-pronounced single-particle structure. <lb/>Mirror symmetry of ANCs can be used to predict cross <lb/>sections of proton capture at stellar energies using mirror <lb/>neutron ANCs. For example, the astrophysical S-factor <lb/> of the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B reaction can be calculated using the <lb/>ANCs for the overlap integral <lb/> 8  Li| <lb/> 7  Li. The latter has <lb/>been measured recently in [13]. Using this experimental <lb/>value and the predictions for the ratio of the <lb/> 8  B proton <lb/>ANC to the <lb/> 8  Li neutron ANC from the microscopic cluster <lb/>calculations, we get S  17  (0) = 17.8 ± 1.7 eV · b for V2 and <lb/>18.2 ± 1.8 eV · b for the MN. These results agree well with <lb/>most measurements based on indirect methods. <lb/>The microscopic calculations for bound-unbound mir-<lb/>ror states have confirmed that the main trend in the be-<lb/>haviour of the ratio between the proton width and the <lb/>mirror neutron ANC squared is well reproduced by the <lb/>analytical formula (11). The difference between the pre-<lb/>dictions of this formula and the exact microscopic calcu-<lb/>lations is less than 20% for narrow proton resonances. <lb/>The mirror symmetry between the proton width and <lb/>the mirror neutron ANC can be used to predict unknown <lb/>widths of very narrow resonances. <lb/>It can also be used as a test of the accuracy for ex-<lb/>perimentally measured ANCs. For example, for the neu-<lb/>tron ANC of <lb/> 8  Li(1 <lb/> +  ) measured in [13] and the proton <lb/>width of <lb/> 8  B(1 <lb/> +  ) from [14] we get R  exp  = (2.29 ± 0.28) × <lb/> 10 <lb/> −3  ¯ hc. This is significantly larger than the predictions <lb/> R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> = (1.73 ± 0.03) × 10 <lb/> −3  ¯ hc of the microscopic <lb/>model. The proton width of <lb/> 8  B(1 <lb/> +  ) has recently been <lb/>remeasured in <lb/> 7  Be + p scattering [15], which leads to <lb/> R  exp  = (1.92 ± 0.23) × 10 <lb/> −3  ¯ hc. The remaining difference <lb/>between R  exp  and R <lb/> MCM <lb/>Γ <lb/> requires the verification of the <lb/>accuracy of the determination of the <lb/> 8  Li(1 <lb/> +  ) ANC. <lb/> This work has been supported by the UK EPSRC via grant <lb/>GR/T28577. <lb/></body>

A simple approach is presented to estimate the position of the first opposite-parity state for p-<lb/>and sd-shell nuclei. The approach is based on the assumption that the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction <lb/>determines the energy of the lowest-lying states, and they are a mixture of a few leading SU (3) irreps <lb/>even in the presence of further symmetry-breaking interactions. The quadrupole-quadrupole interaction <lb/>together with the indirect effect of the Pauli exclusion principle will then lead to a rich structure in the <lb/>trends of observables along Z, N and A chains. A comparison with the experimental data is given, with <lb/>the carbon chain as illustrative example. The findings suggest that the changing shell structure near the <lb/>neutron drip line might be explained by the appearance of low-lying highly deformed 2¯ hω states. <lb/> PACS. 21.60.Fw Models based on group theory – 21.10.Hw Spin, parity and isobaric spin <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> With the evolution of nuclear physics increasingly com-<lb/>plex models have been developed in order to describe the <lb/>structure of the nucleus, this many-body system of nu-<lb/>cleons interacting via complicated forces. These models <lb/>are considered successful if they are able to account for a <lb/>wide variety of observables with reasonable accuracy. In <lb/>order to fulfill these requirements it is usually necessary <lb/>to use numerous parameters and basic assumptions when <lb/>the models are constructed. Even then many models can <lb/>be used only in a limited domain of nuclei, and even there <lb/>their performance is considered really successful only for <lb/>specific examples. At the same time the complicated ma-<lb/>chinery of these models often obscures the basic physical <lb/>picture behind the phenomena they describe. <lb/>In light of this one often finds simple approaches, in-<lb/>cluding even some oversimplified ones rather useful to gain <lb/>insight into nuclear structure and to obtain thumb rules <lb/>for certain structural properties of nuclei. For example, <lb/>in [1] a two-level model was introduced which helped to <lb/>understand pairing properties and the onset of deforma-<lb/>tion in nuclei. In [2] a simple picture was used to predict <lb/>shell inversion in <lb/> 11  Be, while in [3] the structure of nu-<lb/>clei is looked upon from the simplest angle and trends <lb/>in structure can be understood via elementary considera-<lb/>tions. Such simple models can be as useful as very sophis-<lb/>ticated ones, because they allow for a transparent descrip-<lb/> a  e-mail: levai@atomki.hu <lb/> tion of gross structures and shed some light onto usually <lb/>complicated situations. <lb/>In this contribution we present a schematic but sys-<lb/>tematic approach designed to account for some elementary <lb/>observables of p-and sd-shell nuclei in a consistent way. <lb/>These are the excitation energies of the lowest positive-<lb/>and negative-parity states with special attention to the <lb/>position of the first state with parity opposite to that of <lb/>the ground state. This approach rests on the assumption <lb/>that an extremely simplified (one-parameter) Hamiltonian <lb/>dominated by the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and <lb/>observing the Pauli principle is sufficient to trace quali-<lb/>tatively the position of these states. It is assumed that <lb/>these states originate from the lowest (i.e. the 0¯ hω, 1¯ hω <lb/> and 2¯ hω) shells and have dominant contribution only from <lb/>a few leading SU (3) basis states of the Elliott model [4]. <lb/>It then follows that even if the SU (3) symmetry is bro-<lb/>ken, the relative energies of these states are not influenced <lb/>significantly by the mixing. <lb/>The rationale of this simple approach is that focus-<lb/>ing only on certain basic observables of a large number <lb/>of nuclei (from <lb/> 4  He to <lb/> 40  Ca) can be at least as useful as <lb/>more sophisticated models that describe many levels of <lb/>one (or a few) nucleus. Despite its simplicity, the present <lb/>approach takes into account the most important factors in <lb/>this region: the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction that <lb/>generates deformation and the Pauli principle that se-<lb/>lects the allowed (SU (3)) configurations. The interplay of <lb/>these two key elements then generates characteristic struc-<lb/>tural changes in the trend of the fundamental observables <lb/></body>

It is also possible <lb/>to estimate the importance of the neglected interactions <lb/>(pairing, spin-orbit, etc.) <lb/>The aim of this study is not the description of individ-<lb/>ual nuclei, rather to search for trends in the mass, neu-<lb/>tron and proton number, which might indicate structural <lb/>changes. This can be instructive for experiments targeting <lb/>unexplored regions of the nuclide chart. <lb/> 2 The approach <lb/> In this section we present the basic assumptions of our <lb/>approach and discuss their importance together with their <lb/>validity in various domains of p-and sd-shell nuclei [5]. <lb/> Assumption 1. The lowest-lying states can reasonably be <lb/>described in terms of the harmonic oscillator shell model <lb/>of Elliott [4] in the sense that they have dominant contri-<lb/>bution only from a few leading SU (3) basis states. <lb/>The validity of the Elliott model has been proven for <lb/>many light nuclei, which means that the physical states <lb/>can be described reasonably well in terms of the SU (3) <lb/>basis states of the model. This implies that the SU (3) sym-<lb/>metry is largely respected by the interaction terms consid-<lb/>ered in the Hamiltonian. The most important term in the <lb/>Elliott Hamiltonian is the Q · Q quadrupole-quadrupole <lb/>interaction, which is closely related to the second-order <lb/>Casimir invariant C  2  of the SU (3) group. In fact, in the <lb/>best examples of the Elliott model ( <lb/> 20  Ne, <lb/> 24  Mg, etc.) the <lb/>physical states are almost pure SU (3) states belonging <lb/>to the leading SU (3) irreducible representation (irrep) <lb/>(λ, μ), i.e. the one for which C  2  has maximal eigenvalue <lb/> C  2  (λ, μ) = λ <lb/> 2  + μ <lb/> 2  + λμ + 3λ + 3μ. These leading SU (3) <lb/>states are also the most deformed ones. While the over-<lb/>all magnitude of λ and μ determine the magnitude of the <lb/>deformation, their relative size is indicative for the na-<lb/>ture of the deformation. In particular, irreps with large λ <lb/> and small μ represent prolate deformation, while the re-<lb/>verse situation corresponds to oblate shape. When neither <lb/>numbers are small compared to the other, a triaxial shape <lb/>occurs. <lb/>Obviously, in most cases the SU (3) symmetry is bro-<lb/>ken, nevertheless, it was found that even when this <lb/>happens, only SU (3) irreps with similar C  2  (λ, μ) get <lb/>mixed [6], so the average expectation value of the Casimir <lb/>invariant C  2  is close to the expectation value for the lead-<lb/>ing SU (3) irrep. If this mechanism holds not only for the <lb/>0¯ hω states, but also for the lowest-lying 1¯ hω and 2¯ hω <lb/> states, then the energy differences of the opposite-parity <lb/>levels are moderately sensitive to the actual symmetry <lb/>breaking. <lb/>This scenario is a reasonable approximation in mid-<lb/>shell situations, but it might fail close to shell closures, <lb/>where there are fewer SU (3) irreps and even these have <lb/>different C  2  (λ, μ) expectation value. Furthermore, the <lb/>breakdown of the SU (3) symmetry is also stronger near <lb/>the shell closures, i.e. where N and Z are close to 2, 8 <lb/>and 20. <lb/>In general the construction of the full SU (3) model <lb/>space is a difficult task, however, the leading SU (3) irreps <lb/>can be identified relatively easily. Due to the total anti-<lb/>symmetry of the nuclear wave function, the spatial and <lb/>the spin-isospin structure of the nucleus is correlated. In <lb/>practical terms this means that the maximal spatial sym-<lb/>metry (exhibiting itself in maximal deformation) comes <lb/>with maximal antisymmetry in the spin-isospin sector, so <lb/>in the lowest-lying configurations the protons and neu-<lb/>trons tend to pair off separately. There is thus a rela-<lb/>tively simple recipe which we can use to determine the <lb/> SU (3) character of the states in question by extracting <lb/>the SU (3) content of the proton and neutron configura-<lb/>tions on each shell (s, p, sd, pf and sdg, the latter two <lb/>only in excited configurations), and combining them to <lb/>obtain the largest possible (λ, μ) irrep. Table 1 lists the <lb/>(λ, μ) quantum numbers associated with proton and neu-<lb/>tron configurations possessing maximal symmetry in the <lb/>spatial sector [4]. We list all configurations on the s and p <lb/>shells, while for the sd shell we present the (λ, μ) irreps up <lb/>to particle number n = 6, which corresponds to the mid-<lb/>dle of the shell: for n &gt; 6 the appropriate SU (3) irreps <lb/>are obtained as the conjugates (μ, λ) of the SU (3) irreps <lb/>belonging to 12 − n &lt; 6 particles. In table 1 the pf and <lb/>sdg shells appear with configurations consisting of up to <lb/>2 and 1 particles, respectively, because only such systems <lb/></body>

Table 1 also contains the permutational <lb/>symmetry [f ] associated with the proton and neutron con-<lb/>figurations on each major shell, and it is a straightforward <lb/>task to construct the possible permutational symmetries <lb/>of both nucleon types and of the whole nuclear state. <lb/>In order to determine the leading SU (3) irrep (λ, μ) <lb/> for configurations without major shell excitation (0¯ hω) <lb/> we simply have to take the (λ <lb/> i <lb/> π  , μ <lb/> i <lb/>π  ) and (λ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  , μ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  ) irreps <lb/>obtained for protons and neutrons from the i-th shell (s, <lb/>p, sd, pf, sdg for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively), and com-<lb/>bine them to get λ = <lb/>  5 <lb/> i=1  (λ <lb/> i <lb/>π  + λ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  ), μ = <lb/>  5 <lb/> i=1  (μ <lb/> i <lb/>π  + μ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  ). <lb/>We illustrate this procedure with the example of the <lb/> 16  C <lb/>nucleus consisting of Z = 6 protons and N = 10 neutrons. <lb/>Table 2 displays the possible proton and neutron config-<lb/>urations up to two shell excitation quanta, together with <lb/>the corresponding leading (λ <lb/> i <lb/>π  , μ <lb/> i <lb/>π  ) and (λ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  , μ <lb/> i <lb/>ν  ) SU (3) ir-<lb/>reps. The leading 0¯ hω is then found to be (4,2). <lb/>As can be seen from table 2, there are several con-<lb/>figurations for 1¯ hω depending on whether we excite one <lb/>nucleon from the valence shell to the next highest shell <lb/>or from the shell below to the valence shell. We have to <lb/>calculate the leading irrep from each of these following the <lb/>recipe given above. The leading SU (3) irrep is found to <lb/>be (7,1), which originates from the (3,1) proton and (4,0) <lb/>neutron configuration. It also has to be mentioned that <lb/>in order to get rid of spurious states, the center-of-mass <lb/>motion has to be subtracted. In the harmonic-oscillator <lb/>picture this is done very easily: the SU (3) irreps of the <lb/>0¯ hω model space have to be multiplied by the (1,0) SU (3) <lb/>irrep representing one excitation quantum in the c.m. mo-<lb/>tion, and the resulting (λ, μ) states have to be subtracted <lb/>from the 1¯ hω model space obtained before [7]. The largest <lb/>(λ, μ) irrep with multiplicity larger than 0 will then be <lb/>the leading one for 1¯ hω. It is obvious from table 2 that <lb/>the (7,1) irrep is not redundant. The 2¯ hω space can be <lb/>constructed in a similar way: proton and neutron config-<lb/>urations with altogether two shell excitations have to be <lb/>considered. Then the leading SU (3) irrep is found to be <lb/>(10,0), which originates from the 2¯ hω (6,0) proton and the <lb/>0¯ hω (4,0) neutron configuration. <lb/>It has to be mentioned that in certain special situa-<lb/>tions the simple recipe outlined above might not produce <lb/>automatically the leading SU (3) state. This is the case in <lb/>the middle of the sd shell, when 6 identical nucleons can <lb/>yield the (6,0) and also the (0,6) SU (3) state, as can be <lb/>seen from table 1. In these ambiguous situations further <lb/>assumptions have to be made in order to select the config-<lb/>uration that leads to the leading SU (3) irrep of the total <lb/>wave function. The general rule is that the contribution of <lb/>the other type of nucleons, as well as that of the same type <lb/>of nucleons from the p shell have to be taken into consider-<lb/>ation: the leading SU (3) irrep is obtained if λ or μ reaches <lb/>the possible maximal value. This corresponds to a kind of <lb/> &quot; polarization &quot; effect in the sense that the two types of nu-<lb/>cleons attempt to realize similar kind of deformation, i.e. <lb/> prolate or oblate. In fact, this effect can appear in sd <lb/> 5  and <lb/>sd <lb/> 7  configurations too, to which the simple rule would as-<lb/>sign (5,1) and (1,5) as in table 1, while the construction of <lb/>the true leading SU (3) state might require the secondary <lb/>(2,4) and (4,2) states, with opposite kind of deformation. <lb/> Assumption 2. The simplified Hamiltonian <lb/> H = ¯ hωN − χC  2  (λ, μ) <lb/> (1) <lb/>is sufficient to account for the excitation energy of the <lb/>lowest few levels. <lb/>Here the first term accounts for major shell excita-<lb/>tions (N = 0, 1, 2), while C  2  is the second-order Casimir <lb/>operator of SU (3) mentioned earlier. Since the states are <lb/>supposed to be composed of several SU (3) basis states <lb/>the expectation value of C  2  should be the corresponding <lb/>average of the C  2  (λ, μ) eigenvalues. However, based on <lb/>Assumption 1 we replace this average with the eigenvalue <lb/>belonging to the leading SU (3) state, which can be de-<lb/>termined using the mechanism presented previously. The <lb/>two coupling constants appearing in (1) are known to be <lb/>parametrized in terms of A only. In particular, we can take <lb/>the formula <lb/>¯ hω = 45A <lb/> −1/3 <lb/> − 25A <lb/> −2/3  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>(in units of MeV), which was deduced from the systematic <lb/>behaviour for light nuclei near the valley of stability [8]. <lb/>This value might thus change when the neutron drip line <lb/>is approached: due to loosely bound neutrons the average <lb/>¯ hω might be lowered. For χ we take <lb/> χ = aA <lb/> − <lb/> 5 <lb/> 3  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>which is a generally accepted parametrization [9].

In practical terms this means <lb/>that the SU (3) breaking interactions (e.g., pairing) might <lb/>mix further SU (3) states with the leading ones, so the <lb/>replacement of C  2  (λ, μ) with the C  2  (λ, μ) eigenvalue of <lb/>the leading SU (3) irrep might not be a good approxima-<lb/>tion in this case. In fact, this effect could be compensated <lb/>by taking larger χ values near the shell closures, which is <lb/>exactly what fig. 1 indicates in these regions. <lb/>In a full scale spectroscopic study further terms should <lb/>also be considered in (1), however, if we focus only on low-<lb/>lying levels that have low values for the orbital angular <lb/>momentum and spin, terms like the spin-orbit interaction, <lb/> L <lb/> 2  , L · S and spin-dependent forces are not expected to <lb/>contribute significantly to the energy [5]. <lb/>Before closing this section we return to the major as-<lb/>sumptions of our approach, i.e. that in order to account <lb/>for the general trends in the lowest-lying levels of nuclei <lb/>in this region it is sufficient to incorporate the two most <lb/>important factors, i.e. the quadrupole-quadrupole inter-<lb/>action that generates deformation and the Pauli princi-<lb/>ple that selects the allowed (SU (3)) configurations. The <lb/>interplay of these two key elements then generates char-<lb/>acteristic structural changes in the trend of the funda-<lb/>mental observables we investigate, and does so without <lb/>incorporating further model assumptions concerning e.g. <lb/> the deformation of nuclei, which is an important input for <lb/>alternative models. Obviously, the breakdown of SU (3) <lb/>symmetry and thus the mixing of SU (3) states has strong <lb/>influence on further observables. This is the case, for ex-<lb/>ample, with the electric quadrupole moment, because its <lb/>expectation value is calculated from quantities that signif-<lb/>icantly differ from each other in their magnitude, and in <lb/>addition, might also have different sign.

In total about 180 <lb/>nuclei in the p and sd shell were considered and of those <lb/>predictions were made for about 80 nuclei. In general, the <lb/>agreement was satisfactory. The general trend was well <lb/>reproduced, although not always in terms of absolute val-<lb/>ues. As illustration we present our results in tabular and <lb/>graphical form in table 3 and fig. 2 for the carbon isotope <lb/>chain. It is seen from fig. 2 that the rich structure of the <lb/>experimental plot is excellently reproduced by the calcu-<lb/>lated one and not only in its trend, but also in magnitude. <lb/>It is remarkable that the odd-even staggering structure is <lb/>reproduced without any spin-dependent interactions, by <lb/>considering only terms depending on the orbital structure <lb/>of the nuclei. This odd-even staggering effect appeared in <lb/>other isotope chains too, mainly with even value of Z (Be, <lb/>Ne, Mg, Si, S) [5], and apart from the Mg chain, even <lb/>its magnitude was reproduced reasonably well. Another <lb/>characteristic feature reproduced rather successfully was <lb/>a bump near N = 8 in the N, O and F chain, which obvi-<lb/>ously originates from the shell closure effect. <lb/>Deviations from the experimental plot appeared in cer-<lb/>tain well-defined regions. This was the case for light iso-<lb/>topes A ≤ 10, where the theoretical curve systematically <lb/>fell behind the experimental one, leading even to shell in-<lb/>version in some cases. As we have discussed before, this <lb/>might be the consequence of the underestimation of ¯ hω <lb/> in (2) in this region.

This, again, is obviously due to the <lb/>shell closure effect which influences the results through an <lb/>underestimated χ value. This can also be traced down on <lb/>fig. 1. <lb/>The trends described here can be understood from ta-<lb/>ble 3, where the SU (3) states (λ, μ) are displayed for the <lb/>leading 0, 1 and 2¯ hω states. It is seen that proceeding <lb/>along the isotope chain λ and μ rarely change with more <lb/>than one unit as the shells are filled up with more and <lb/>more neutrons. There are, however, some discontinuities <lb/>for 1 and 2¯ hω, e.g. at <lb/> 16  C. This is due to the fact that <lb/>particles excited to higher shells typically contribute to <lb/>the whole system with SU (3) configurations correspond-<lb/>ing to prolate deformation (see table 2). This shows up in <lb/>a low E  Th  (2¯ hω) level too, as can be seen in fig. 2. It is <lb/>a general trend in other isotopes too that the 0¯ hω state <lb/>can be prolate, oblate or triaxial type, while the excited <lb/>states tend to proceed towards the prolate direction with <lb/>relatively large deformation. <lb/>We mention here that the <lb/> 16  C nucleus is known to ex-<lb/>hibit some unusual features. It was found, for example, <lb/>that there is an extremely weak electric quadrupole tran-<lb/>sition from the first 2 <lb/> +  state at E  x  = 1.766 MeV to the <lb/>ground state [10], furthermore, the observations were com-<lb/>patible with a large deformation, especially for protons. In <lb/>our scheme the leading 0¯ hω and 2¯ hω states belong to the <lb/>(λ, μ) = (4, 2) and (10,0) SU (3) irreps, which certainly <lb/>have rather different structure, leading to a strong hin-<lb/>drance in the electromagnetic transitions between them. <lb/>The 2¯ hω (10,0) states also have strongly prolate nature; in <lb/>particular, they are constructed from an s <lb/> 2  , p <lb/> 2  , sd <lb/> 2  pro-<lb/>ton structure, having (6,0) SU (3) character, and an s <lb/> 2  , <lb/>p <lb/> 6  , sd <lb/> 2  neutron structure, having (4,0) (see table 2). This <lb/>is clearly compatible with the experimental findings. The <lb/>simple scheme yields the energy of the lowest (10,0) state <lb/>at E  x  = 3.04 MeV, which is also rather close to the exper-<lb/>imental energy of the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  state. In summary, we assume <lb/>that even if the SU (3) symmetry is broken and the states <lb/>do not have pure SU (3) character, the ground state of <lb/> 16  C is dominated by 0¯ hω, while the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  state has domi-<lb/>nantly 2¯ hω structure. This also means that there should <lb/>be a 0 <lb/> + <lb/>2  state with dominantly 2¯ hω, and a 2 <lb/> + <lb/>2  state with <lb/>dominantly 0¯ hω character in the vicinity of these levels. <lb/>The states at E  x  = 3.027 MeV and 3.987 MeV might be <lb/>candidates for these. <lb/>The example of the <lb/> 16  C nucleus shows that discontinu-<lb/>ities in some basic observables (e.g. quadrupole moment, <lb/> B(E2), deformation) in the ground-state region of nuclei <lb/>can be the result of the presence of highly deformed low-<lb/>lying 2¯ hω states. This mechanism eventually leads to the <lb/>smearing out of the energy gap and the apparent disap-<lb/>pearance of the shell structure. This scenario can also oc-<lb/>cur near the closure of the N = 20 (or Z = 20) shell, since <lb/>the 0¯ hω configuration has small deformation there, while <lb/>exciting nucleons to the pf and sdg shells may change the <lb/>deformation to the strongly prolate direction. <lb/>There is one more interesting finding found in some <lb/>nuclei that can be illustrated with the example of a carbon <lb/>isotope. In particular, there is a strong discontinuity in <lb/>the 0¯ hω (λ, μ) state at <lb/> 20  C: here the protons correspond <lb/>to the usual p <lb/> 2  (0,2) configuration, while the neutrons <lb/>are assigned to sd <lb/> 6  (0,6) or (6,0) (see table 1). Due to <lb/>the &quot; polarization &quot; effect discussed previously the lowest <lb/>energy arises if the (0,6) neutron state is taken, leading to <lb/>the overall (0,8) state (see table 3). The sd <lb/> 6  configurations <lb/>typically appear at nuclei with N , Z = 14, and can lead <lb/>to underestimated E  Th  (1¯ hω) or E  Th  (2¯ hω) energies in a <lb/>handful of isotopes near the middle of the sd shell [5]. <lb/>Before closing this section, we mention that calcula-<lb/>tions for the quadrupole moments for about sixty nu-<lb/>clei with known Q  Exp  or |Q  Exp  | showed that the pic-<lb/>ture in which a few dominant SU (3) irreps get mixed <lb/>in the lowest-lying states is consistent with the experi-<lb/>mental data [5]. While Q  Th  calculated using the leading <lb/>0¯ hω SU (3) state agrees remarkably well with Q  Exp  for <lb/>nuclei that are known have pure SU (3) character in their <lb/>ground state ( <lb/> 20  Ne, <lb/> 24  Mg, <lb/> 19  F, etc.), it represents an up-<lb/></body>

			<body> per limit in the case of most other nuclei, indicating that <lb/>some other leading SU (3) states mix with the leading one <lb/>significantly. In some cases Q  Exp  was also close to Q  Th <lb/> calculated with the leading 2¯ hω state indicating that such <lb/>states might play important role even in the ground-state <lb/>region. <lb/> 4 Conclusions <lb/> We presented the basic ideas of a simple thumb rule <lb/>approach designed to estimate the position of the first <lb/>opposite-parity (1¯ hω) state and the first 2¯ hω state in light <lb/>nuclei. The full details of the method and the specific re-<lb/>sults concerning about 180 nuclei are given in [5], while <lb/>here we discussed in more detail only the C isotope chain <lb/>to illustrate the main findings. The method is specially <lb/>directed to experimental physicists and they can use it to <lb/>have a first estimate where to look for low lying opposite <lb/>parity states or, even more difficult, where to look at shell <lb/>inversion without the change in parity, i.e. shape isomeric <lb/>states, which is related to the inversion with the 2¯ hω shell. <lb/>The approach rests on two basic assumptions: 1) the <lb/>lowest-lying states are composed only of a few leading <lb/>(λ, μ) SU (3) irreps having comparable C  2  (λ, μ) SU (3) <lb/>eigenvalue; and 2) the terms other than the harmonic <lb/>and quadrupole-quadrupole interaction do not contribute <lb/>significantly to the energy. The approach contains only <lb/>one adjustable parameter (the coupling constant of the <lb/>quadrupole-quadrupole interaction), furthermore, the de-<lb/>formation of the nuclei follows directly from the calcula-<lb/>tions, rather than being an input parameter. <lb/>The simple rules outlined above imply that the joint <lb/>action of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and the <lb/>Pauli principle is able to reproduce the rich structure man-<lb/>ifested in the energy of the first opposite-parity state, <lb/>apart from some well-defined regions. The basic assump-<lb/>tions also guarantee that even if the SU (3) symmetry is <lb/>broken, this does not influence significantly the relative <lb/>energy of the lowest 0, 1 and 2¯ hω levels. Furthermore, al-<lb/>though other observables are more sensitive to the mixing <lb/>of SU (3) states, some of these, e.g. the quadrupole mo-<lb/>ment can be indicative of the nature (e.g. deformation) of <lb/>the states. <lb/>With the example of the C isotopes and <lb/> 16  C in partic-<lb/>ular, we demonstrated that some unusual findings usually <lb/>attributed to the disappearance of the shell structure can <lb/>be explained by our procedure. Though at 0¯ hω the SU (3) <lb/>irrep is small near a closed shell or (0,0) at a closed shell, at <lb/> n¯ hω (n &gt; 0) the corresponding SU (3) irrep can represent <lb/>large deformation at low energy. This result does suggest <lb/>that the mean field description of nuclei near the neutron <lb/>drip line can still be valid and the disappearance of the <lb/>shell structure is only apparent. This effect is the result <lb/>of the Pauli exclusion principle which allows only small <lb/> SU (3) irreps for nuclei near a closed shell but results in <lb/>large SU (3) irreps, and thus a large quadrupole moment <lb/>and deformation for 2¯ hω excitations. This is also related <lb/>to the fact that in light nuclei small changes in the size <lb/>of the SU (3) irreps imply large changes in deformation, <lb/>which is a less drastic effect for heavier nuclei. <lb/> This work was supported by the CONACyT-MTA and CSIC-<lb/>MTA exchange programs, CONACyT, DGAPA (Grant No. <lb/>IN119002) and by the OTKA (Grant No. T37502). <lb/></body>

Experimental signatures of the dynamical correlations of a core with a single-particle neutron <lb/>have been found in light neutron-rich nuclei investigated via the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) charge-exchange reactions at <lb/>around 8 MeV/u. Of particular astrophysical relevance are low-lying narrow resonances (Γ ∼ 200 keV <lb/>FWHM) BSEC (Bound States Embedded in the Continuum). Because of their long lifetime BSEC states <lb/>are likely to effect the capture rates in any scenario for nucleosynthesis in neutron-rich environment. They <lb/>have been observed in the continuum of <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  C nuclei. A microscopic nuclear structure model <lb/>based on QRPA theory, which takes into account Dynamical Core Polarisation (DCP) correlations, gives <lb/>a suitable description of these resonances as well as single-particle states of the studied systems. In this <lb/>context, high-energy narrow structures populated in nuclei having an integer number of α-particles plus <lb/>three neutrons are good BSEC candidates and can be systematically investigated. <lb/> PACS. 21.10.Pc Single-particle levels and strength functions – 21.60.-n Nuclear structure models and <lb/>methods – 25.70.Kk Charge-exchange reactions – 27.20.+n 6 ≤ A ≤ 19 <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> During the last decade the investigation of the structure of <lb/>unstable nuclei has become the major activity of nuclear <lb/>structure physics, leading to the discovery of a variety of <lb/>new phenomena, from halos and neutron skins to shell <lb/>quenching and the appearances of new magic numbers. <lb/>From a theoretical point of view the explanation of new <lb/>phenomena represents a precious benchmark strongly sup-<lb/>porting the development of refined theories based on the <lb/>microscopic description of nuclei.

			<body> hope to bring attention to a general aspect of nuclear con-<lb/>tinuum dynamics, namely the existence of extremely sharp <lb/>resonances in the low-energy continuum. These Bound <lb/>States Embedded into the Continuum (BSEC) are long-<lb/>lived states resulting from configuration mixing between <lb/>simple single-particle states attached to the (inert) ground <lb/>state of the host system and more complex core-excited <lb/>configurations which can only decay via the coupling to a <lb/>continuum of unbound states attached to the core ground <lb/>state. <lb/>Far from the line of β-stability the standard represen-<lb/>tation of nuclei, based on the assumption of mean-field <lb/>dynamics, turns out to be often inadequate. The reason is <lb/>the energy scale of the single-particle states given by the <lb/>separation energy S  n  , which is reduced to a few hundred <lb/>keV, value close to the typical matrix element of the resid-<lb/>ual nuclear interaction. Hence, in loosely bound systems a <lb/>strong competition of mean-field and correlation dynam-<lb/>ics is expected even at low excitation energy. In the case of <lb/> 11  Be nucleus, for instance, this is supported by the obser-<lb/>vations of a considerable amount of <lb/> 10  Be(2 <lb/> +  ) core excited <lb/>configuration in the ground state, which was explored via <lb/>transfer [1] as well as breakup reactions [2]. <lb/></body>

			<body> Experimental signatures of the Dynamical Core Polari-<lb/>sation (DCP) correlations above particle threshold are the <lb/>BSEC [3,4], which were observed in the inelastic scatter-<lb/>ing of stable nuclei. The BSEC are quasibound resonant <lb/>states characterized by a peculiar line shape. They are in-<lb/>terpreted as configurations where a nucleon is re-scattered <lb/>by a core, which can be easily excited into a multi-particle <lb/>configuration with total energy above particle threshold <lb/>but neither of the involved particles by itself is in a con-<lb/>tinuum state. Since such a core excited configuration is <lb/>degenerate with the single particle continuum attached to <lb/>the ground-state the decay will take place only through <lb/>the relatively weak residual interaction. Hence, a nucleon <lb/>trapped in such a configuration remains for long time at-<lb/>tached to the core although the total energy of the direct <lb/>process would be enough to remove it immediately. <lb/>Spectroscopic studies dealing with the weakly bound <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  C nuclei, explored via the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) charge-<lb/>exchange (CEX) reactions at around 8 MeV/u, have <lb/>shown the appearance of narrow resonances (Γ ∼ 200 keV <lb/>FWHM) far from the neutron emission threshold, identi-<lb/>fied most likely as BSEC [5,6]. In sect. 2 the experimen-<lb/>tal results are summarized. As pointed out in refs. [5,6], <lb/>the coupling between the valence neutron and the excited <lb/>states of the core is needed in order to get a correct de-<lb/>scription also of the observed continuum shape. For this <lb/>reason, a microscopic nuclear structure model based on <lb/>the QRPA theory, called DCP model [7,8,9] has been ap-<lb/>plied to the studied nuclear systems. A brief review of it <lb/>is given in sect. 3. The obtained results are then discussed <lb/>and compared to the experimental data. <lb/>Nuclei having a Nα+3n like configuration (where N is <lb/>an integer number) are good candidates to observe BSEC <lb/>(see sect. 4). Clear indications may be provided by high-<lb/>resolution studies of the continuum structures for such nu-<lb/>clear systems. In the low-mass region experimental data <lb/>obtained via the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) CEX reaction at ∼ 8 MeV/u <lb/>are already available for the <lb/> 7  He and <lb/> 19  O nuclei, thus giv-<lb/>ing a systematic overview of these phenomena as a func-<lb/>tion of asymmetry and mass. Some conclusions are dis-<lb/>cussed in sect. 5. <lb/> 2 The ( <lb/> 7 Li, <lb/> 7 Be) CEX reaction <lb/> The ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) CEX reaction has been extensively stud-<lb/>ied in the past mainly because it gives useful information <lb/>on the response function of nuclei to the isovector com-<lb/>ponent of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction [10, <lb/>11]. Since such reactions transform a target proton into <lb/>a neutron, they have a natural relation to β decay pro-<lb/>cesses. Indeed, charge exchange reactions allow to study, <lb/>under well-defined conditions, transitions of β decay-type <lb/>in mass regions which would be otherwise inaccessible. <lb/>Such data are of direct relevance also for astrophysical <lb/>purposes, especially for understanding weak interactions <lb/>in short-lived neutron-rich nuclei far off stability. It is also <lb/>known to be a useful spectroscopic tool at intermediate <lb/>energies [12] where the one-step direct mechanism is con-<lb/>sidered to be dominant. In addition, depending on the <lb/>system chosen and the q-matching condition [13], this re-<lb/>action is an interesting spectroscopic probe at Tandem <lb/>energies as well [14,15,16,17]. In ref. [17] the competition <lb/>between the direct exchange of isospin degree of freedom <lb/>and the two-step transfer mechanisms was faced for the <lb/> 11  B( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) <lb/> 11  Be reaction. Due to the high selectivity of <lb/>the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) reaction, the analogy between the β-decay <lb/> probabilities and the CEX cross sections measured at for-<lb/>ward angles for Gamow-Teller transitions, proved for the <lb/>(p, n) or (n, p) reactions [18,19], is maintained (within 20% <lb/>accuracy) despite the complications coming from the pres-<lb/>ence of the heavy ions involved in the reaction [17]. In the <lb/>case where the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be  g.s.  ) and the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be  0.43  ) transi-<lb/>tions are experimentally resolved (by means of high reso-<lb/>lution or γ-ray coincidence measurements), the observable <lb/> G = σ  1  /(σ  0  + σ  1  ), where σ  0  and σ  1  are the correspond-<lb/>ing cross sections measured for the two cited transitions, <lb/>gives a strong indication on how the reaction mechanism <lb/>proceeds [10,11]. As a consequence of such an analysis, <lb/>it seems that in the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) reaction involving <lb/> 11  Be or <lb/> 15  C the two-step components are hidden also due to the <lb/>structure properties of these unstable nuclei. <lb/> 2.1 Experimental results <lb/> During the last few years, several light stable and unsta-<lb/>ble nuclei, the latter having a Nα + 3n like configura-<lb/>tion (where N is an integer number) have been investi-<lb/>gated with the same probe ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) in a systematic way. <lb/>All the experiments have been performed with a <lb/> 7  Li <lb/> +++ <lb/> beam at around 8 MeV/u provided by the Tandem Van de <lb/>Graaff accelerator at the IPN-Orsay with different targets <lb/>(∼ 100 μg/cm <lb/> 2  thickness), both solid and gas ones. In all <lb/>the cases, the <lb/> 7  Be ejectiles were detected in the focal plane <lb/>detector of the Split-Pole magnetic spectrometer with a <lb/>resolution as good as 50 keV. The focal plane detector was <lb/>a position-and angle-sensitive proportional gas counter <lb/>followed by a stopping plastic scintillator. Measurements <lb/>at forward angles including 0 <lb/> •  were done to get angu-<lb/>lar distribution of the cross sections. A ΔE-E telescope <lb/>of silicon detectors was mounted at around θ  lab  = 30 <lb/> • <lb/> and used as a monitor for normalization procedures. Ad-<lb/>ditional runs with <lb/> 12  C target such as other elements nor-<lb/>mally present as target impurities (or in the windows <lb/>of the gas target) were performed in order to estimate <lb/>the source of background in the spectra. The background <lb/>due to the p( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be)n reaction was always present below <lb/> θ  lab  = 7 <lb/> •  due to the large cross section (∼ 100 mb/sr). <lb/>Some interesting results have been obtained in the case <lb/>of <lb/> 11  Be (S  n  = 0.504 MeV) and <lb/> 15  C (S  n  = 1.218 MeV) <lb/>nuclei. Examples of final spectra detected in the case <lb/>of <lb/> 11  B( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  N( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) <lb/> 15  C reactions at <lb/>around 8 MeV/u are shown in figs. 1 and 2, at θ  lab  = 10.5 <lb/> • <lb/> and θ  lab  = 14 <lb/> •  , respectively. The experimental results <lb/>show that the response of the two nuclei to the same <lb/>probe is quite similar. Single-particle states are populated <lb/>at low excitation energy (∼ 100 μb/sr). At high excitation <lb/>energy, where the DCP regime is expected to be domi-<lb/>nant, BSEC have been identified. In particular, in the <lb/></body>

There, the attempts of spin assignment for <lb/>these states led to high spin values, to account for the ob-<lb/>served hindrance for neutron emission. <lb/>Our data were analyzed in a QRPA many-body ap-<lb/>proach using the formalism of ref. [22]. Special features <lb/>of these exotic systems that must be taken into account <lb/>are described in details in refs. [5,17]. Calculations of mi-<lb/>croscopic QRPA transition densities, assuming configura-<lb/>tions where the valence neutron is coupled to an inert <lb/>core, reproduce well in both cases the level structure be-<lb/>low 2 MeV [5,6], but are not able to explain the strong <lb/>fragmentation of the strength at higher excitation energy. <lb/>A comparison with DWBA calculations, which was <lb/>possible only for the <lb/> 11  Be(g.s., 1/2 <lb/> +  ), <lb/> 11  Be(0.32, 1/2 <lb/> −  ) <lb/>and <lb/> 11  Be(1.77, 5/2 <lb/> +  ) states [17], and for the <lb/> 15  C(g.s., 1/2 <lb/> +  ) and <lb/> 15  C(0.77, 5/2 <lb/> +  ) ones [23], shows <lb/>that the corresponding angular distributions are quanti-<lb/>tatively well reproduced without any scaling factor and <lb/>without the necessity to introduce two-steps contribu-<lb/>tions. The unnatural-parity state transitions, both in <lb/>the projectile and in the target, account for most of the <lb/>observed cross sections. The distribution at around 0 <lb/> •  of <lb/>the G ratio as a function of the excitation energies are <lb/>also well described in the DWBA framework. <lb/>In addition, a quite asymmetric line shape has been <lb/>observed in the spectra of <lb/> 15  C at several angles in corre-<lb/>spondence of the 8.5 MeV resonance (see fig. 2), explained <lb/>as the result of the interference between the BSEC and <lb/>the three-body continuum [24,25]. Such an observation is <lb/>an important experimental signature of the existence of <lb/>BSEC. <lb/> 3 Nuclear structure model <lb/> Single-particle configurations of the odd-mass nuclei with <lb/>respect to an even-even vibrating core nucleus have been <lb/>investigated theoretically [26]. In ref. [27], correlations <lb/>in the <lb/> 11  Be nucleus were calculated as corrections to <lb/>the Hartree-Fock potential due to the coupling of single-<lb/>particle states to RPA collective one-phonon states of the <lb/> 10  Be core. The result, in case of the <lb/> 11  Be ground state, <lb/>leads to a strong admixture (∼ 20%) of a d  5/2  neutron <lb/>coupled to the <lb/> 10  Be(2 <lb/> +  ) core, in agreement with experi-<lb/>mental results (see [2] for a review). In these calculations <lb/>a non microscopic effective interaction was used. Recently, <lb/>coupling of single particle motion with core vibrations <lb/>has been further investigated as correlations always in the <lb/> 11  Be case [28], in a similar way as we did. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex"> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> Our DCP model is a microscopic version of the quasi-<lb/>particle-core coupling (QPC) model originally proposed <lb/>by Bohr and Mottelson [29], and adopted in the past for <lb/>stable nuclei. The ground state of the even-even nucleus <lb/>(core) is supposed to be known as the vacuum state for the <lb/>quasiparticle operators. The wave functions of the odd-<lb/>mass system can be written as <lb/> |jm, E  λ  = <lb/> n <lb/> z  nj  |nljm + <lb/> j   Jc <lb/> z  j   Jc  |(j <lb/>  J  c  )jm, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where |nljm is the one-quasiparticle (1QP) state with or-<lb/>bital and total angular momentum l and j, parity π  j  = <lb/>(−1) <lb/> l  and radial quantum number n ≥ 1. The second <lb/>term of eq. (1) corresponds to the core excited compo-<lb/>nents (3QP) with a 1QP j <lb/>  and one-particle-one-hole (two-<lb/>quasiparticle (2QP)) core excitations J  c  coupled to have <lb/>total angular momentum j. <lb/> The effective Hamiltonian of the odd-mass system, is <lb/>separated into H  0  , which is diagonal in the 1QP and 2QP <lb/>states, and the residual interaction V  13  , which couples 1QP <lb/>to 3QP configurations. The residual interaction used is <lb/>derived from the M3Y-G matrix interaction [30]. <lb/>The main feature of the DCP model is the derivation <lb/>of an effective Schrödinger equation for the single-particle <lb/>part coupled to core excited configurations, leading to an <lb/>energy dependent contribution in the single-particle self-<lb/>energy operator affecting the separation energy and the <lb/>wave function [31]. The originality of the method consists <lb/>in expanding the single-particle component of the wave <lb/>function of the odd-mass nucleus into a set of unperturbed <lb/>wave function of fixed orbital and total angular momen-<lb/>tum (l, j) but different radial quantum number n ( &quot; major <lb/>shell mixing &quot; ). It is due to the fact that the nucleon is re-<lb/>scattered by the core, which can have a very large energy. <lb/>Then, the high-lying core excitations enter off-the-energy-<lb/>shell into the mass operator of low-lying excitations of <lb/>the odd-mass system. Since the parity of the eigenstate is <lb/>fixed by π  j  , the core excited configurations are restricted <lb/>by the parity selection rule π  j  = π  j   π  Jc  . The single parti-<lb/>cle strengths |z| <lb/> 2  are distributed over the whole spectrum, <lb/>but in the most cases a fraction is found in an interval of <lb/>several MeV around the eigenvalue E  λ  . The BSEC are <lb/>directly related to those solutions which lead to a wave <lb/>function in which one or several core excited states carry <lb/>the main part of the strength. However, since also the 1QP <lb/>strength is non-vanishing these states can still be excited <lb/>in one-step transfer process. <lb/></div>

			<body> 3.1 Results of the calculations <lb/> In order to give an interpretation of the continuum <lb/>states populated in the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) CEX reactions at about <lb/>8 MeV/u DCP calculations were done for <lb/> 15  C [32,33] and <lb/>recently also for <lb/> 11  Be [34]. <lb/>Being a microscopic approach we first describe the <lb/>ground state of the even-even core <lb/> 10  Be and <lb/> 14  C nuclei by <lb/>Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) theory. The proton and <lb/>neutron single-particle energies and wave functions have <lb/> Fig. 3. Calculated single-particle strength of <lb/> 11  Be for j = 1/2 <lb/> + <lb/> (solid line) and j = 1/2 <lb/> −  (dashed line). See the text for details. <lb/> been calculated assuming an isoscalar potential Wood-<lb/>Saxon (WS) shaped, for the central part, and the radial <lb/>derivative of a WS, for the spin-orbit part. The depth pa-<lb/>rameters of such potentials have been chosen in order to <lb/>reproduce the HFB single-particle energies of the core. <lb/>Especially the QRPA strength functions of <lb/> 10  Be(2 <lb/> +  ) <lb/>and <lb/> 14  C(1 <lb/> −  ) are quantitatively well described [34]. The <lb/>interaction is kept the same for all the studied cases. <lb/>In fig. 3 the single-particle strength functions s  1/2  and <lb/> p  1/2  calculated for the <lb/> 11  Be nucleus are plotted as a func-<lb/>tion of the 1QP energy. The DCP results of the calculated <lb/> s  1/2  and d  5/2  single-particle strengths of <lb/> 15  C are presented <lb/>in fig. 4. In all the cases, the contribution coming from the <lb/>natural parity states of the core up to J  c  = 3 have been in-<lb/>cluded. Even if the absolute energy values are not quanti-<lb/>tatively well reproduced, the level inversion between 2s  1/2 <lb/> and 1p  1/2  in <lb/> 11  Be is obtained and their energy difference <lb/>calculated is around 0.390 MeV. The energy difference be-<lb/>tween the 2s  1/2  and 1d  5/2  in <lb/> 15  C is underestimated, being <lb/>0.110 MeV, but, also here, the experimental level order-<lb/>ing is correctly reproduced. Fragmentation of the strength <lb/>above 3 MeV and 7 MeV is present in <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  C cal-<lb/>culations, respectively, demonstrating that a detailed mi-<lb/>croscopic description of the core coupling is very impor-<lb/>tant. Strong overlap between 1QP and 3QP states appears <lb/>above 8 MeV in the <lb/> 15  C case, with the dominance of 1 <lb/> −  , 2 <lb/> + <lb/> and 3 <lb/> − 14  C exited states. In the <lb/> 11  Be case, contributions <lb/>of the <lb/> 10  Be(2 <lb/> +  ) are mainly found at around 3–4 MeV. Ac-<lb/>cording to our theoretical results, we do not support the <lb/>necessity to assume in our experimental data configura-<lb/>tions where the neutron occupies an orbital with an high <lb/>orbital angular momentum. <lb/> C.

Calculated single-particle strength of <lb/> 15  C for j = 1/2 <lb/> + <lb/> (solid line) and j = 5/2 <lb/> +  (dashed line). See the text for details. <lb/> Spectroscopic factors in agreement with the values pro-<lb/>vided experimentally have been obtained. Core excited <lb/>state configurations like d  5/2  ⊗ <lb/> 10  Be(2 <lb/> +  ) are present in the <lb/>wave function of the ground state of <lb/> 11  Be at 18%. The <lb/>main component for the ground state of <lb/> 15  C is represented <lb/>by the s  1/2  ⊗ <lb/> 14  C(0 <lb/> +  ) configuration. <lb/> 4 Other explored Nα + 3n systems <lb/> In a more general context, the <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  C nuclei, can <lb/>be imagined as systems where a hard core made of an <lb/>integer number of alpha particles (Nα) is coupled to three <lb/>neutrons. Assuming that single-particle excitations of the <lb/> α-clusters are rather unlikely (hard core) at low excitation <lb/>energy, the few-body dynamics in the nuclear medium <lb/>can be studied. Since the pairing is expected to play an <lb/>important role in the three-neutron phase space, a large <lb/>contribution to it is represented by one valence nucleon <lb/>coupled to the core, which is made softer by the remaining <lb/>nucleon pair. Phenomena directly associated to that may <lb/>be experimentally observed by studying such systems. In <lb/>this context, experiments involving systems having N = 1 <lb/>and N = 4, i.e. <lb/> 7  He and <lb/> 19  O, have already been done. <lb/>Concerning <lb/> 7  He, the <lb/> 7  Li( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) <lb/> 7  He reaction was <lb/>performed at about 8 MeV/u using a special target in or-<lb/>der to minimized the oxidation of the Li contained in it. <lb/>The ground state, which is particle instable with respect <lb/>to the decay into <lb/> 6  He + n by 0.44 MeV and has a width of <lb/>0.160 MeV, was easily identified. Another resonant state <lb/>was found at around 2.90 MeV, supposed to be the same <lb/>populated in other transfer reaction experiments at low <lb/>and intermediate energies [35]. No trace of the low reso-<lb/>nance identified at around 1.2 MeV [36] was found. The <lb/> Fig. 5.

Due to higher <lb/>neutron separation energy (S  n  = 3.957 MeV) in compar-<lb/>ison to the <lb/> 11  Be and <lb/> 15  C ones, the interesting region to <lb/>explore here is at higher excitation energy. Moreover, the <lb/>presence of the background due to Li and other impurities <lb/>in the LiF target, makes it difficult to have clean access <lb/>to an excitation energy interval greater than 8 MeV. The <lb/>ground and the level at 0.096 MeV of <lb/> 19  O nucleus, are vis-<lb/>ibly well separated in fig. 6 where a detail of the spectrum <lb/>measured at 0 <lb/> •  , obtained using an AlF  3  target, is shown. <lb/> 5 Conclusion <lb/> Exploration of excited states in light neutron-rich nuclei <lb/>is a rich source of information about nuclear structure. <lb/>We also hope to have indicated a special aspect of nu-<lb/>clear continuum dynamics which might be of relevance <lb/>for reaction rates and lifetimes of neutron-rich nuclei in <lb/>astrophysical processes. Excited states in <lb/> 11  Be, <lb/> 15  C, <lb/> 7  He <lb/>and <lb/> 19  O have been investigated via the ( <lb/> 7  Li, <lb/> 7  Be) at very <lb/>similar bombarding energy (∼ 8 MeV/u). The obtained <lb/>high-energy resolution has been crucial for that purpose. <lb/>A dominant observed feature in the <lb/> 15  C and <lb/> 11  Be cases <lb/>is the strong fragmentation of strength in BSEC at high <lb/>excitation energy. The use of refined microscopic theories, <lb/>such as the DCP model, has been fundamental in order to <lb/>interpret them as single-particle states where the neutron <lb/>is coupled to core excited states. The experiments and <lb/>their analysis discussed here are considered as a first step <lb/>into the largely unexplored regime of continuum dynam-<lb/>ics and BSEC states in weakly bound nuclei. The results <lb/>deserve further work, especially also in order to clarify the <lb/>role of such states in astrophysical processes. <lb/>Particularly interesting for this phenomenology is the <lb/>exploration of Nα + 3n like nuclei with N &gt; 4. They still <lb/>have not been explored since the cross sections at this <lb/>low bombarding energies were expected to go down, mak-<lb/>ing the experiments quite difficult. On the other hand, <lb/>the study of these heavier systems is very important in <lb/>order to learn about the influence of mass and asymme-<lb/>try parameters on these phenomena. The advent of the <lb/>MAGNEX spectrometer [37] at the LNS-INFN in Cata-<lb/>nia will allow to go on with the systematics by studying <lb/>less favorable cases, fully exploiting the large solid angle. <lb/>This device will make it possible to perform measurements <lb/>with increasing statistics and much less number of angle <lb/>settings, preserving a good energy resolution. <lb/></body>

			<body>Received: 17 June 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 21 March 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. We study the equation of state of strongly interacting matter at large densities and vanishing <lb/>temperature. The hadronic matter equation of state is computed in a relativistic mean-field model and <lb/>the quark matter equation of state is computed using a NJL-type model which takes into account the <lb/>possibility of formation of the gapless color flavor locked phase. We focus in particular on the possible <lb/>phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter using both Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. We <lb/>finally discuss the relevance of the equation of state in the context of compact stars and we propose some <lb/>astrophysical signatures of the presence of quark matter in compact stars. <lb/> PACS. 26.60.+c Nuclear matter aspects of neutron stars – 25.75.Nq Quark deconfinement, quark-gluon <lb/>plasma production, and phase transitions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The equation of state of strongly interacting matter at <lb/>densities below the saturation density of nuclear mat-<lb/>ter ρ  0  = 0.16 fm <lb/> −3  is relatively well known [1,2] due to <lb/>the large amount of experimental data on nuclear physics <lb/>available. At larger densities there are many uncertainties <lb/>due to the lack of experimental data; the saturation of <lb/>nuclear force makes, in fact, the compression of nuclear <lb/>matter at larger densities quite difficult. In ultra relativis-<lb/>tic heavy-ion collision experiments the baryon densities <lb/>can reach values of a few times ρ  0  at temperatures of <lb/> ∼ 150–200 MeV. The only &quot; natural laboratories &quot; in which <lb/>matter is compressed to densities up to ten times ρ  0  are <lb/>compact stars. For these reasons, the study of these stellar <lb/>objects can shed light on the equation of state of strongly <lb/>interacting matter at extreme conditions. In particular, it <lb/>has been extensively studied the possibility of formation, <lb/>in the core of a compact star, of &quot; exotic &quot; particles as the <lb/>hyperons or meson condensates of pions or kaons, or fi-<lb/>nally, it has been suggested that a phase transition from <lb/>hadronic matter to quark matter, in which the quarks <lb/>composing the baryons are deconfined, can occur. Con-<lb/>cerning quark matter, in particular, recent studies on the <lb/>QCD phase diagram at finite densities and temperatures <lb/>have revealed the existence of a rich structure of the phase <lb/>diagram with several possible phases in which a color su-<lb/>perconducting state can be formed [3]. The fundamental <lb/>phenomenological problem in the study of compact stars <lb/> a  e-mail: pagliara@fe.infn.it <lb/> is to investigate how the measurable properties of these <lb/>stellar objects as masses, radii, thermal evolution, periods <lb/>of rotation etc., depend on the equation of state of mat-<lb/>ter. In principle, it is therefore possible to put constraints <lb/>on the theory of the QCD phase diagram from astrophys-<lb/>ical observations and measurements on compact stars. In <lb/>this paper we will first analyze the equation of state of <lb/>strongly interacting matter focusing in particular on the <lb/>phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter, <lb/>eventually in its color superconducting phase and we will <lb/>propose some signatures of the presence of quark matter <lb/>in a compact star. <lb/> 2 Equation of state of compact stars matter <lb/> 2.1 Hadronic matter <lb/> Concerning hadronic matter, we use the relativistic field-<lb/>theoretical approach to the nuclear equation of state [4]. <lb/>In this theory the interactions between hadrons are de-<lb/>scribed by the exchange of three mesons, the scalar field <lb/> σ, the vector field ω and the isovector field ρ. The La-<lb/>grangian of the model has five free parameters which are <lb/>fixed imposing that the model reproduces five measured <lb/>quantities of the nuclear matter, i.e. the saturation den-<lb/>sity, the binding energy per nucleon, the incompressibility, <lb/>the effective mass of nucleons and the symmetry energy. <lb/>This model can easily incorporate all the particles of the <lb/>baryon octet [5,6] and in particular baryons containing <lb/></body>

The effective chemical potentials ν  B  are given <lb/>in terms of the thermodynamic chemical potentials μ  B <lb/> and of the vector meson fields as follows: <lb/> ν  B  = μ  B  − g  ω  ω − t  3B  g  ρ  ρ , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where t  3B  is the isospin 3-component for baryon B and <lb/>the relation to the Fermi momentum k  F B  is provided by <lb/> ν  B  = <lb/> k  2 <lb/> F B  + M  <lb/>B <lb/> 2  . The isoscalar and isovector meson <lb/>fields (σ, ω and ρ) are obtained as a solution of the field <lb/>equations in the mean-field approximation [6]. <lb/>The equation of state of compact star matter must <lb/>satisfy the beta equilibrium and charge neutrality condi-<lb/>tions. The former allows to express the chemical potentials <lb/>of all the particles as linear combinations of the baryonic <lb/>and electric charge chemical potential (μ  B  and μ  C  ): <lb/> μ  i  = b  i  μ  B  + c  i  μ  C  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where b  i  is the baryon number of the particle and c  i  is its <lb/>electric charge in unit of the electron charge. <lb/>The condition of charge neutrality, taking into account <lb/>also the densities of leptons, reads <lb/>0 = ρ  p  + ρ  Σ  +  − ρ  Σ  −  − ρ  Ξ  −  − ρ  e  − ρ  μ  , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where ρ  i  indicate the number densities of the various <lb/>particles. With all these conditions we can calculate the <lb/>hadronic-matter equation of state as a function of only <lb/>one chemical potential, the baryon chemical potential μ  B  . <lb/> 0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.2 <lb/> Ρ  B  fm <lb/> 3  <lb/> 0.5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3 <lb/>Pfm <lb/> 4  <lb/> NM <lb/>HM <lb/> Fig. 2.

Notice in particular <lb/>how the density of neutrons start to decrease as neutral <lb/>hyperons start to form. In fig. 2 the pressures as a function <lb/>of baryon density for nuclear matter and hadronic matter <lb/>are compared. As it can be seen the presence of hyperons <lb/>makes the equation of state softer. <lb/>The model described so far will be used for densities of <lb/>matter of the order of or larger than the saturation density <lb/> ρ  0  . For lower densities we will use the Negele-Vautherin <lb/>and the Baym-Pethick-Sutherland equations of state [1,2]. <lb/> 2.2 Quark matter <lb/> In high-density hadronic matter, baryons are forced to <lb/>stay so close to one another that they would overlap, the <lb/>constituent quarks are shared by neighboring baryons and <lb/>should eventually become mobile over a distance larger <lb/>than the typical size of one baryon. This means that <lb/>quarks become deconfined and that at large densities they <lb/>are the real degrees of freedom of strongly interacting mat-<lb/>ter instead of baryons. The process of deconfinement and <lb/>the equation of state of quark matter can in principle be <lb/>described by QCD. However in the energy scale involved <lb/>in a compact star, QCD is non-perturbative and therefore <lb/>simple phenomenological models are usually adopted to <lb/>describe quark matter as the MIT bag model [7], the NJL <lb/>model [8] or the Color Dielectric Model [9]. <lb/> 2.2.1 Unpaired quark matter <lb/> The simplest model to describe quark matter is the MIT <lb/>bag model. In this model, quark matter is described as <lb/>a gas of free quarks with massless up and down quarks <lb/>and strange quarks having a &quot; current mass &quot; variable be-<lb/>tween 80–200 MeV. All the &quot; non-perturbative physics of <lb/>QCD &quot; is simulated by the bag constant B which repre-<lb/>sents the pressure of the vacuum. The thermodynamic <lb/></body>

Considering just the one-gluon <lb/>exchange potential, there is a channel of interaction be-<lb/>tween quarks which is attractive and which corresponds <lb/>with the two incoming quarks to be in the ¯ 3 channel. From <lb/>the results of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of su-<lb/>perconductivity, it is known that if in a Fermi gas there <lb/>is an arbitrary weak attractive potential, the Fermi sur-<lb/>face becomes unstable with respect to the formation of a <lb/>condensate of Cooper pairs. Therefore, as it happens in <lb/>metals at low temperature, also in quark matter an insta-<lb/>bility with respect to the formation of Cooper pairs be-<lb/>tween quarks does develop, originating the phenomenon of <lb/>the so-called color superconductivity. The order parameter <lb/>characterizing this phase is the value of the diquark con-<lb/>densate or, in other words, the color superconducting gap <lb/> Δ. The possibility of the existence of this phase of QCD <lb/>was first shown at asymptotic densities, i.e. in a pertur-<lb/>bative regime [10,11]. The same results have been extrap-<lb/>olated to lower densities using models of quark matter as <lb/>for example the NJL model [12]. Both schemes leads to a <lb/>value of Δ ∼ 100 MeV. Such a high value indicates that, <lb/>at variance with the superconductivity in metals, color su-<lb/>perconductivity is very robust because in the only place of <lb/>the universe in which it can appear, the core of compact <lb/>stars, the temperature is very low (few keV). This obser-<lb/>vation has encouraged further studies in this direction, see <lb/>ref. [3] for an exhaustive review. <lb/>It is not yet understood which type of color supercon-<lb/>ducting phase can appear in a compact star. It is widely <lb/>accepted that the Color-Flavor Locking phase (CFL) is <lb/>the real ground state of QCD at asymptotically large den-<lb/>sities. In this phase, up, down, and strange quarks are <lb/>present and all of them are involved in the formation of <lb/>Cooper pairs. As a consequence, all the quarks have a <lb/>common Fermi level and therefore charge neutrality and <lb/>beta stability are automatically satisfied without the pres-<lb/>ence of leptons [13]. The CFL phase can form only if the <lb/>mass of the strange quark m  s  is small with respect to <lb/>the superconducting gap and the chemical potential. All <lb/>these considerations are valid at high density. At lower <lb/>densities, there is still uncertainty about the presence of <lb/>CFL phase and in particular about the transition from the <lb/>CFL phase to the hadronic phase. At intermediate values <lb/>of m  s  , it is in general difficult to involve strange quarks <lb/>in BCS pairing due to their Fermi momentum, which is <lb/>lower than that of up and down quarks. Recently, it has <lb/>been shown that the CFL phase can form only if the ra-<lb/>tio m <lb/> 2 <lb/> s  /μ  2Δ  CF L  [14]. At larger values of m <lb/> 2 <lb/> s  /μ, but <lb/>not too large values of m  s  , the most energetically favored <lb/>phase is the so-called gapless CFL (gCFL) phase instead <lb/>of the 2SC phase or unpaired quark matter [15,16,17]. The <lb/>gCFL phase has the same symmetries as the CFL phase <lb/>but there are two gapless quark modes and a nonzero elec-<lb/>tron density and therefore it can have very different trans-<lb/>port properties respect to the CFL phase. <lb/>To compute the equation of state of the (g)CFL phase <lb/>we adopt the NJL-like formalism of refs. [14,15,16] in <lb/>which the thermodynamic potential per unit volume can <lb/>be written as <lb/> Ω = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4π  2 <lb/> d p p <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> |  j  (p)|ρ  j  (p) <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/> G <lb/> (Δ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  + Δ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  + Δ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ) − <lb/> μ <lb/> 4 <lb/> e <lb/> 12π  2  , <lb/> (11) <lb/>where Δ  1  , Δ  2  , Δ  3  are the superconducting gaps charac-<lb/>terizing the gCFL phase (which reduce to a single gap in <lb/>the CFL phase), G is the strength of the diquark coupling, <lb/>  j  (p) are the dispersion relations of quarks as in ref. [15] <lb/>and μ  e  is the electron chemical potential. Following the <lb/>approximations used in refs. [14,15], the effect of m  s  is in-<lb/>troduced as a shift −m <lb/> 2 <lb/> s  /2μ in the chemical potential for <lb/>the strange quarks and the contributions of antiparticles is <lb/>neglected. In eq. (11) we have introduced the quasiparticle <lb/>probabilities <lb/> ρ  j  (p) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> 1 − <lb/> ˜ <lb/>  j  (p) <lb/>  j  (p) <lb/> , <lb/> (12) <lb/>where <lb/>   (p) are the dispersion relations with vanishing <lb/>gaps. To assure the convergence of the integral in eq. (11), <lb/>a form factor f = (Λ <lb/> 2  /(p <lb/> 2  + Λ <lb/> 2  )) <lb/> 2  , which multiplies the <lb/>gaps, is introduced in the dispersion relations  j  (p). The <lb/>form factor was fixed to mimic the effects of the asymp-<lb/>totic freedom of QCD [12] and the parameter Λ was fixed <lb/>at a value of 800 MeV. <lb/></body>

[15] for details). The color and elec-<lb/>tric charge neutrality are imposed by the following three <lb/>equations: <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>μ  3 <lb/> = 0, <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>μ  8 <lb/> = 0, <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>μ  e <lb/> = 0 . <lb/> (13) <lb/>Moreover, the thermodynamic potential must be mini-<lb/>mized with respect to the gap parameters and therefore <lb/>we have to impose the three additional conditions: <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>Δ  1 <lb/> = 0, <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>Δ  2 <lb/> = 0, <lb/> ∂Ω <lb/>Δ  3 <lb/> = 0 . <lb/> (14) <lb/>The above equations allow us to compute the thermody-<lb/>namic potential and all the thermodynamic variables as <lb/>a function of the quark chemical potential only.

In the calculation of <lb/>the possible mixed phases, hadronic-unpaired quark phase <lb/>or hadronic-CFL phase, we use the Gibbs construction in <lb/>which the equations of mechanical, thermal and chemi-<lb/>cal equilibrium are simultaneously imposed.

The <lb/>thin solid lines represent the phase transitions from the mixed <lb/>phase to the gCFL phase for the two diquark couplings. Notice <lb/>that in the case of G  1  a gCFL phase window is still present. <lb/> matter or 2SC quark matter is more plausible. In this case <lb/>the equation of state of strongly interacting matter has <lb/>two first-order phase transitions: a first one from hadronic <lb/>matter to unpaired quark matter (or 2SC) and a second <lb/>one from unpaired quark matter (or 2SC) to the (g)CFL <lb/>phase (see refs. [18,19,20]). This scenario is shown in fig. 5 <lb/>where the pressure as a function of the baryon density is <lb/>shown for different equations of state. The first phase tran-<lb/>sition occurs between nuclear matter and unpaired quark <lb/>matter (thick and dot-dashed lines) and the second phase <lb/>transition (here computed using Maxwell construction for <lb/>simplicity) occurs between the nuclear-quark mixed phase <lb/>and the (g)CFL phase (dot-dashed and thin solid lines). <lb/>The couplings G  1  and G  2  are the same of fig. 3 and the dot <lb/>on the curve labeled with G  1  represents the onset of the <lb/>CFL phase. Notice that for large diquark coupling (G  2  ) <lb/>the transition from the mixed phase to the (g)CFL phase <lb/>occurs above the onset of the gCFL-CFL phase and for <lb/>small diquark coupling (G  1  ) a window of the gCFL phase <lb/>is instead present. Concerning the hyperons, within this <lb/>choice of parameters the transition from hadronic matter <lb/>to gCFL quark matter occurs before reaching the thresh-<lb/>old of the formation of hyperons. If we use larger values of <lb/>the bag constant, the first critical density may be larger <lb/>than the threshold of the formation of hyperons.

The dashed line are the lines of constant baryonic <lb/>mass. <lb/> pact stellar objects (radius less than 10 km) if quark mat-<lb/>ter is present [21]. Other interesting ways to study the <lb/>composition of a compact star come from the analysis of <lb/>the cooling of the stars [22] or the stability with respect <lb/>to the r-modes [23]. In both cases, the weak-decay chan-<lb/>nels involving the strange quark can strongly affect the <lb/>transport properties of the matter of the compact star. <lb/>Recently, it has been shown that also from gravitational <lb/>wave signals from isolated compact stars, we can obtain <lb/>important informations on the structure and composition <lb/>of a star [24,25]. Finally, the formation of quark matter <lb/>in a compact star can have a role also in the most vio-<lb/>lent explosive phenomena of the Universe, i.e. supernovae <lb/>and gamma-ray-bursts [26]. Here, as an example, we will <lb/>discuss only the effect of the formation of quark matter <lb/>during a supernova explosion. <lb/>Let us first introduce the expression of the baryonic <lb/>mass of a star: <lb/> M  B  = m  n <lb/>  R <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr <lb/>4πr <lb/> 2 <lb/> (1 − 2m(r)/r)  1/2  ρ  B  (r), <lb/>(15) <lb/>where m  n  is the neutron mass, m(r) is the mass in a sphere <lb/>of radius r, ρ  B  is the total baryon density. The energy re-<lb/>leased in a supernova explosion is the difference between <lb/>the gravitational mass of the core of the progenitor star M  c <lb/> and the gravitational mass of the final compact star. The <lb/>energy released corresponds also to the binding energy of <lb/>the star. For practical purposes we can assume that M  c  ∼ <lb/> M  B  . Therefore, the energy released can be approximated <lb/>as the difference M  B  − M . Almost all of this energy is re-<lb/>leased in neutrinos. In fig. 6, we display the binding energy <lb/>for neutron stars, hadronic stars and hybrid stars (without <lb/>CFL) and CFL-hybrid stars, as functions of the gravita-<lb/>tional mass. For a fixed value of the baryonic mass, which <lb/>as already stated roughly corresponds to the mass of the <lb/>collapsing core, we can calculate the energy released in the <lb/>collapse. Typical values of this energy are of the order of <lb/>10 <lb/> 53  ergs. It is evident from fig. 6 that, for a fixed baryonic <lb/>mass (dashed lines), the binding energy of a CFL-hybrid <lb/></body>

			<body> star can be a few times that of a neutron star and therefore <lb/>the corresponding energy released is larger. Figure 6, sug-<lb/>gests, moreover, that, if in the future new supernova events <lb/>will be detected, it will be possible from the signal of the <lb/>emitted neutrinos to obtain information on the equation <lb/>of state of the matter in compact stars. For instance, if <lb/>the energy released in neutrinos is of the order of or larger <lb/>than ∼ 4 × 10 <lb/> 53  erg, we can exclude hybrid or hadronic <lb/>stars. A similar energy may be released in the formation <lb/>of a neutron star but this would require a baryon mass for <lb/>the core ∼ 2M   what seems difficult in the light of recent <lb/>supernovae simulations [27]. In this case only a CFL (CFL-<lb/>hybrid) star can be a plausible candidate. This conclusion <lb/>agrees with the well-known results that the stars contain-<lb/>ing quark matter are more bounded that hadronic stars. <lb/></body>

			<div type="acknowledgement"> 4 Conclusions <lb/> In this paper, we studied the equation of state of strongly <lb/>interacting matter at large densities and vanishing tem-<lb/>perature. We analyzed in particular the possibility of a <lb/>phase transition from hadronic matter and quark matter. <lb/>We included in our calculation the recent results on the <lb/>QCD phase diagram indicating two first-order phase tran-<lb/>sitions: a first one from hadronic matter to unpaired quark <lb/>matter and a second one from unpaired quark matter to <lb/>the color flavor locked phase. These theoretical results can <lb/>be tested studying compact stars which are the only places <lb/>in the universe in which the density of matter can reach <lb/>values up to ten times the nuclear matter saturation den-<lb/>sity. We listed the different signatures of the presence of <lb/>quark matter in a compact star and we discussed, in par-<lb/>ticular, a scenario in which during a supernova explosion <lb/>deconfinement of quarks is realized in the newly born com-<lb/>pact star. <lb/></div>

The relativistic invariant approach is applied to analyzing the 3.3 A GeV <lb/> 22  Ne fragmentation <lb/>in a nuclear track emulsion. New results on few-body dissociations have been obtained from the emulsion <lb/>exposures to 2.1 A GeV <lb/> 14  N and 1.2 A GeV <lb/> 9  Be nuclei. It can be asserted that the use of the invariant <lb/>approach is an effective means of obtaining conclusions about the behavior of systems involving a few He <lb/>nuclei at a relative energy close to 1 MeV per nucleon. The first observations of fragmentation of 1.2 A GeV <lb/> 8  B and <lb/> 9  C nuclei in emulsion are described. The presented results allow one to justify the development of <lb/>few-body aspects of nuclear astrophysics. <lb/> PACS. 21.45.+v Few-body systems – 23.60.+e α decay – 25.10.+s Nuclear reactions involving few-nucleon <lb/>systems <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Interactions in few-body systems consisting of more than <lb/>two <lb/> 1,2  H and <lb/> 3,4  He nuclei can contribute to a nucleosyn-<lb/>thesis pattern. A macroscopic medium composed of the <lb/>lightest nuclei having energy of the nucleosynthesis scale <lb/>can possess properties analogous to those of dilute quan-<lb/>tum gases of atomic physics. In this sense, few-body fu-<lb/>sions imply a phase transition to &quot; drops &quot; of a quantum <lb/>liquid, that is, to heavier nuclei. Fusions can proceed via <lb/>the states corresponding to low-lying cluster excitations <lb/>in forming nuclei. <lb/>On a microscopic level the phase transition can pro-<lb/>ceed through the production of quasi-stable and loosely <lb/>bound quantum states. Among candidates for such states <lb/>one can consider the dilute α-particle Bose condensate [1] <lb/>as well as radioactive and unbound nuclei along the proton <lb/>drip line. At first glance, exploration of few-body tran-<lb/>sitions in laboratory conditions seems to be impossible. <lb/>Nevertheless, such processes can indirectly be explored in <lb/> a  e-mail: zarubin@lhe.jinr.ru <lb/>  †  Deceased. <lb/> the inverse processes of relativistic nucleus breakups in a <lb/>nuclear track emulsion by selecting excitations close to the <lb/>few-body decay threshold. <lb/>Experimental data on the charged topology for the fi-<lb/>nal states of a number of light nuclei have been described <lb/>in [2,3,4,5,6]. More specific studies were performed for <lb/>the leading channels like <lb/> 12  C → 3α [7], <lb/> 16  O → 4α [8,9], <lb/> 6  Li → dα [10,11], <lb/> 7  Li → tα [12], <lb/> 10  B → dαα [13], and <lb/> 7  Be → <lb/> 3  Heα [14]. A collection of appropriate reaction im-<lb/>ages can be found in [15,16]. <lb/>In the present paper the behaviour of relativistic sys-<lb/>tems consisting of several H and He nuclei will be de-<lb/>scribed in terms of invariant variables of a 4-velocity space <lb/>as suggested in [17].

			<body> Fig. 1. Example of peripheral interaction of a 2.1 A GeV <lb/> 14  N nucleus in a nuclear track emulsion ( &quot; white &quot; star). The interaction <lb/>vertex (indicated as IV) and nuclear fragment tracks (H and He) in a narrow angular cone are seen on the upper microphotograph. <lb/>Following the direction of the fragment jet, it is possible to distinguish 1 singly and 3 doubly charged fragments on the middle <lb/>and bottom microphotograph. <lb/> 8  B and <lb/> 9  C nuclei in emulsion are described in this report. <lb/>Last emulsion exposures were performed at the JINR Nu-<lb/>clotron in the years 2002-4 [18]. <lb/> 2 Nuclear fragment jets <lb/> The relativistic projectile fragmentation results in the pro-<lb/>duction of a fragment jet which can be defined by invariant <lb/>variables characterizing relative motion: <lb/> b  ik  = − <lb/> P  i <lb/> m  i <lb/> − <lb/> P  k <lb/> m  k <lb/>  2 <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/>with P  i(k)  and m  i(k)  being the 4-momenta and the masses <lb/>of the i or k fragments. Following [17], one can suggest <lb/>that a jet is composed of the nuclear fragments having <lb/>relative motion within the non-relativistic range 10 <lb/> −4  &lt; <lb/>b  ik  &lt; 10 <lb/> −2  . The lower limit corresponds to the ground-<lb/>state decay <lb/> 8  Be → 2α, while the upper one to the bound-<lb/>ary of low-energy nuclear interactions. The expression of <lb/>the data via the relativistic invariant variable b  ik  makes <lb/>it possible to compare the target and projectile fragmen-<lb/>tation in a common form. Figure 1 shows the micropho-<lb/>tograph of a special example of a projectile fragment jet <lb/>— the &quot; white &quot; star as introduced in [3]. It corresponds to <lb/>the case of a relativistic nucleus dissociation accompanied <lb/>by neither a target fragment nor meson production. <lb/>The variable characterizing the excitation of a frag-<lb/>ment jet as a whole is an invariant mass M <lb/>  *  defined as <lb/> M <lb/>  * 2  = (ΣP  j  ) <lb/> 2  = Σ(P  i  · P  k  ). <lb/>(2) <lb/>The system excitation can be characterized also by <lb/> Q = M <lb/>  * <lb/> − M <lb/> (3) <lb/>with M being the mass of the ground state of the nucleus <lb/>corresponding to the charge and weight of the fragment <lb/>system. The variable Q corresponds to the excitation en-<lb/>ergy of the system of fragments in their cms. A useful <lb/>option is <lb/> Q <lb/>  = <lb/>(M <lb/>  * <lb/> − M <lb/>  ) <lb/> A <lb/>, <lb/> (4) <lb/>with M <lb/>  being the sum of fragment masses and A the total <lb/>atomic weight. The normalized variable Q <lb/>  characterizes <lb/>a mean kinetic energy of fragments per nucleon in their <lb/>cms. Precision of the experimental b  ik  and Q values is <lb/>driven to a decisive degree by the angular resolution in <lb/>the determination of unit vectors defining the direction of <lb/>the fragment emission. <lb/>Due to excellent spatial resolution (about 0.5 μm) the <lb/>emulsion technique is known to be most adequate for the <lb/>observation and angular measurements of projectile frag-<lb/>ments down to a total breakup of relativistic nuclei. Nev-<lb/>ertheless, it has restrictions on the determination of the <lb/>4-momentum components of fragments. Firstly, the frag-<lb/>ment spatial momentum in the projectile fragmentation <lb/>cone is suggested to be equal within a few percent error to <lb/>the primary nucleus value when normalized to the nucleon <lb/>numbers. Secondly, by multiple scattering measurements <lb/>it is possible to identify the mass only for relativistic H <lb/>isotopes and much harder for He ones. Normally, the α-<lb/> particle mass is taken for the mass of doubly charged frag-<lb/>ments in a narrow fragmentation cone. Both assumptions <lb/>are proven to be reasonable for light stable nuclei. <lb/></body>

The predicted property of these systems is a narrow <lb/>velocity distribution in the cms [1]. Originating from rel-<lb/>ativistic nuclei, they can appear as narrow nα jets in the <lb/>forward cone defined by the nucleonic Fermi motion. The <lb/>determination of the cms for each event is rather ambigu-<lb/>ous while analysis of jets in the b  ik  space enables one to <lb/>explore nα particle systems in a universal way. <lb/>At our disposal there are data on 4100 events from <lb/>3.3 A GeV <lb/> 22  Ne nucleus interactions with emulsion nu-<lb/>clei (presented in [2]) which contain the classification of <lb/>secondary tracks by ionization and angles. The key fea-<lb/>ture for the <lb/> 22  Ne fragmentation consists in a suppression <lb/>of binary splittings into medium charge fragments with <lb/>respect to He and H cluster formation. The increase of <lb/>a fragmentation degree is revealed in a growth of the α <lb/> particle multiplicity. Thus, transition to the nα particle <lb/>states having a high level density predominates over the <lb/>binary splittings occurring at lower energy thresholds. <lb/>In the present analysis, the doubly charged particles <lb/>found in a forward 6 <lb/> •  cone were classified as relativistic <lb/> α particles. Figure 2 shows the b  ik  distribution (1) for <lb/>the fragmentation channel <lb/> 22  Ne → nα for n equal to 3 <lb/>(240 events), 4 (79 events), and 5 (10 events) which is <lb/>rather narrow. The distribution &quot; tails &quot; appear to be due <lb/>to the <lb/> 4  He diffractive scattering or <lb/> 3  He formation pro-<lb/>ceeding at higher momentum transfers. The events, sat-<lb/>isfying the non-relativistic criterion b  ik  &lt; 10 <lb/> −2  for each <lb/> α-particle pair were selected for n equal to 3 (141 events), <lb/>4 (47 events), and 5 (6 events). <lb/>Figure 3 presents the normalized Q <lb/>  distribution (4) for <lb/>them.

The <lb/> 8  Be nucleus reveals itself <lb/>in the formation of α-particle pairs having an extremely <lb/>small opening angle of the order of a few 10 <lb/> −3  rad in the <lb/>range of a few GeV. The estimation of the <lb/> 8  Be production <lb/>probability will make it possible to clear up the interrela-<lb/>tion between n-<lb/> 8  Be and α-n-α excitation modes which are <lb/>important in understanding the <lb/> 9  Be structure and frag-<lb/>mentation of heavier nuclei. <lb/>A secondary <lb/> 9  Be beam was produced through fragmen-<lb/>tation of the primary 1.2 A GeV <lb/> 10  B beam. In scanning <lb/>emulsion layers exposed to <lb/> 9  Be nuclei, about 200 interac-<lb/>tions are detected with He pair produced in a forward 8 <lb/> • <lb/> cone. As in the previously considered cases, the b  ik  distri-<lb/>bution for 50 measured events, which is shown in fig. 6, <lb/>confirms the non-relativistic behavior of the relative mo-<lb/>tion of the produced α-particles. In just the same way as <lb/>in the case of the <lb/> 14  N nuclei, softening of the criterion of <lb/>selection of the 2He pairs does not lead to changes of the <lb/>distribution shape. <lb/>Figure 7 shows the Q  2α  distribution (3) allowing one <lb/>to estimate the excitation scale. There is an event concen-<lb/>tration below 1 MeV which is relevant for the <lb/> 8  Be ground-<lb/>state decay. Besides, one can resolve a bump at around <lb/></body>

In this <lb/>case, the absence of <lb/> 9  B nuclei among secondary fragments <lb/> Table 2. Charge-topology distribution of the &quot; white &quot; stars <lb/>originated from the dissociation of 2.1 A GeV <lb/> 8  B nuclei. <lb/> Z  f <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 – <lb/>– <lb/>– <lb/> N2 <lb/> – <lb/>– 2 <lb/>1 <lb/>– <lb/> N1 <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 1 <lb/>3 <lb/>5 <lb/> Nws 15 1 9 11 3 <lb/> turned out to be good luck, resulting in a clear separation <lb/>of the primary and secondary beams by their magnetic <lb/>rigidity. When scanning emulsions, this fact was indirectly <lb/>confirmed by the absence of &quot; white &quot; stars with a charge <lb/>topology He + H. They could be produced by background <lb/> 6  Li having the same magnetic rigidity as <lb/> 10  B nuclei. A <lb/>15% admixture of <lb/> 7  Be nuclei was eliminated according to <lb/>the charge topology of the found &quot; white &quot; stars. The most <lb/>intensive background presented by <lb/> 3  He nuclei was visually <lb/>separated. <lb/>By scanning over the incoming tracks, a total of 39 <lb/> &quot; white &quot; stars, in which the charge in the 15 <lb/> •  -cone is equal <lb/>to 5, have been found. Their distribution by the charge <lb/>modes is shown in table 2 in the same manner as in table 1. <lb/>The significance of the <lb/> 8  B modes can be compared with <lb/>the topology of &quot; white &quot; stars produced by the 1 A GeV <lb/> 10  B nuclei [13]. The fraction of the 3-prong stars <lb/> 10  B → <lb/> 2He + <lb/> 1,2  H was established to be equal to 80% with 40% <lb/>deuteron clustering. The probability of the 2-prong mode <lb/> 10  B → <lb/> 9  Be + <lb/> 1  H was found to be equal only to 3%. Such <lb/>a strong difference can be explained by the lower value of <lb/>the <lb/> 2  H binding energy. <lb/>As is shown in table 2, an obvious distinction of the <lb/> 8  B case consists in a high yield of the 2-prong mode <lb/> 8  B → <lb/> 7  Be+ <lb/> 1  H. This feature is due to the weak <lb/> 1  H binding. <lb/>Thus, one can conclude that the loosely bound <lb/> 8  B nucleus <lb/>manifests its structure already in the charge-topology. <lb/>Further it is planned to increase statistics, identify the <lb/>H and He isotopes, and reconstruct emission angles. <lb/>Obtaining <lb/> 10,11  B beams at the JINR Nuclotron makes <lb/>it possible to form <lb/> 10,11  C secondary beams by the use of <lb/>charge-exchange reactions analogous to the <lb/> 7  Li → <lb/> 7  Be <lb/>process [15]. This method is optimal for the emulsion tech-<lb/>nique where the simplicity of identification of incoming <lb/>nuclei rather than their intensity is of importance. The <lb/>existence and the cross sections of such processes will be <lb/>established in a separate experiment. The suggested emul-<lb/>sion exposures will allow one to explore the 3-prong modes <lb/> 10,11  C → 3He analogous to the case <lb/> 12  C → 3α [7]. Clus-<lb/>tering in <lb/> 12  C → 3α reflects the ternary α process. Study <lb/>of the 3He clustering in <lb/> 10,11  C fragmentation would serve <lb/>as a basis for studying the possible role of the 3He fusion <lb/>process in nucleosynthesis, that is, in media with a mixed <lb/>composition of He isotopes. <lb/> 7 Charged topology of <lb/> 9 C fragmentation <lb/> Unfortunately, it is impossible to use the approach based <lb/>on a charge-exchange reaction for the formation of a <lb/> 9  C <lb/>nucleus beam.

A search was <lb/>made for the events in which the total charge of tracks <lb/>in a forward 15 <lb/> •  cone is equal to 6. The presently found <lb/>17 events are distributed as shown in table 3. The 3He <lb/>mode, which dominates the <lb/> 12  C &quot; white &quot; stars, is seen to <lb/>be suppressed. Besides, there is an indication that multi-<lb/>ple dissociation channels predominate over possible can-<lb/>didates to the p+ <lb/> 8  B and p+p+ <lb/> 7  Be modes. Verification of <lb/>this observation makes a farther increase in statistics to <lb/>be particularly intriguing. <lb/>The cases, which might be interpreted as 3 <lb/> 3  He, are <lb/>of especial importance, since they point to highly-lying <lb/>cluster excitations associated with a strong nucleon rear-<lb/>rangement to produce the 3 <lb/> 3  He system. Like the process <lb/> 12  C → 3α, this dissociation can be considered as a vis-<lb/>ible reflection of the inverse process of a ternary N  ws  He <lb/>fusion. It can provide a significantly higher energy output <lb/>followed by <lb/> 4  He pair production.

It is shown <lb/>that doubly charged fragments having relative b  ik  within <lb/>the range b  ik  &lt; 10 <lb/> −2  form well-separated nα jets. It corre-<lb/>sponds to the relative motion of α-particles with relative <lb/>kinetic energy of the order of 1 MeV per nucleon in the jet <lb/>center-of-mass system. <lb/>New experimental observations are reported from the <lb/>emulsion exposures to <lb/> 14  N and <lb/> 9  Be nuclei with energy <lb/>above 1 A GeV. Being applied to the fragmentation of <lb/>these nuclei the invariant analysis is shown to be a promis-<lb/>ing means to study excited states of simple α-particle sys-<lb/>tems. The internal energy of a system involving He frag-<lb/>ments can be estimated in an invariant form down to the <lb/> 8  Be nucleus decays. <lb/>The pattern of the relativistic fragmentation becomes <lb/>more complete in the case of proton excess in the explored <lb/>nucleus. It is shown that nuclear track emulsions provide <lb/>unique possibilities to explore few-body decays of <lb/> 8  B and <lb/> 9,10,11  C nuclei. The paper describes the start of this work. <lb/>The invariant approach applied for the stable nuclei will <lb/>be of special benefit in the case of the neutron-deficient <lb/>nuclei. <lb/>In spite of statistical restrictions, nuclear track emul-<lb/>sions ensure the initial stage of investigations in an unbi-<lb/>ased way and enable one to develop scenarios for dedicated <lb/>experiments [16].

The usual neutron-proton BCS wave function is simultaneously projected on both the good <lb/>neutron and proton numbers using a discrete projection operator. The projected energy of the system is <lb/>deduced as a limit of rapidly convergent sequence. It is numerically studied for the N = Z nuclei of which <lb/> &quot; experimental &quot; pairing gaps may be deduced from the experimental odd-even mass differences. It then <lb/>appears that the particle-number fluctuation effect is even more important than in the case of pairing <lb/>between like-particles. <lb/> PACS. 21.60.-n Nuclear structure models and methods – 21.30.Fe Forces in hadronic systems and effective <lb/>interactions <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> Renewed interest in the study of the neutron-proton (np) <lb/>pairing correlations occurred recently (cf., e.g., [1,2,3,4,5, <lb/>6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]) due to the <lb/>development of the radioactive beam facilities that made <lb/>possible the experimental study of medium mass nuclei <lb/>such as N  Z. The study of these proton-rich nuclei is <lb/>not only interesting from the nuclear structure point of <lb/>view, but it is also important in the astrophysical con-<lb/>text. Indeed, it is believed that this kind of nuclei are syn-<lb/>thesized in the rapid-proton capture process (rp-process) <lb/>under astrophysical conditions [22,23]. Moreover, most of <lb/>these nuclei are not accessible in experiments and there-<lb/>fore many nuclear astrophysics calculations crucially de-<lb/>pend on accurate theoretical prediction for the nuclear <lb/>properties. In N  Z nuclei, the neutron and proton Fermi <lb/>levels are close to each other and therefore the np pairing <lb/>correlations are expected to play a significant role in their <lb/>structure. <lb/>On the other hand, one of the most exciting subjects of <lb/>the modern nuclear physics is the double-beta decay, be-<lb/>cause one expects an answer to the question whether the <lb/>neutrino is a Majorana or a Dirac particle (cf., e.g., [24, <lb/>25,26,27]). Indeed, neutrinoless double-beta decay pro-<lb/>ceeds only when neutrinos are massive Majorana parti-<lb/>cles, hence its observation would resolve the question [28]. <lb/>It has been shown that the inclusion of the np pairing <lb/> a  e-mail: allaln@yahoo.com <lb/> influences the neutrinoless double-beta decay rates signif-<lb/>icantly [9]. <lb/>Most often, pairing is treated within a generalized <lb/>BCS treatment [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. However, the short-<lb/>comings of this approach are well known: the most <lb/>important of them is the number symmetry breaking <lb/>that may imply serious errors in the evaluation of sev-<lb/>eral physical observables. The usual techniques used in <lb/>order to remedy this shortcoming are those already <lb/>used for the study of pairing correlations between like-<lb/>particles, i.e. the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approx-<lb/>imation (QRPA) (cf., e.g., [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]), <lb/>the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) method [18] or the Generator <lb/>Coordinate Method (GCM) [19]. However, in these meth-<lb/>ods, the particle-number symmetry is only approximately <lb/>restored. Recently, an exact particle-number projection <lb/>method in the isovector case has been proposed [29]. It <lb/>is based on a discrete form of the projection operator that <lb/>allows one to derive an explicit form of the projected wave-<lb/>function. The method was applied within the Richardson <lb/>schematic model [30]. The aim of the present work is to <lb/>study numerically the particle-number fluctuations effects <lb/>on the energy in a realistic case, i.e. for the N = Z nuclei <lb/>of which the &quot; experimental &quot; pairing gaps Δ  p  , Δ  n  and Δ  np <lb/> may be deduced from the experimental odd-even mass dif-<lb/>ferences [3]. The single-particle energies used are those of <lb/>a Woods-Saxon deformed mean field. The structure of this <lb/>paper is as follows: the BCS theory is briefly recalled in <lb/>sect. 2. The projection method is presented in sect. 3. The <lb/>numerical results are given and discussed in sect. 4. <lb/></body>

The pairing strengths G  pp  , G  nn  and <lb/> G  np  are then chosen such as to exactly reproduce the &quot; ex-<lb/>perimental &quot; values of Δ  pp  , Δ  nn  and Δ  np  . For the study of <lb/> N = Z nuclei of higher masses (and of which &quot; experimen-<lb/>tal &quot; pairing gaps are not known), one should first have to <lb/>establish by a fit an expression of the pairing strengths <lb/>from the previously obtained values, and then to extrap-<lb/>olate this expression. <lb/> 4.2 Convergence of the method <lb/> We have reported in table 1, the overlap Ψ |Ψ  nn   , the <lb/>particle-number fluctuations ΔN  nn   as well as the pro-<lb/>jected energy E  nn   (MeV) values as a function of the ex-<lb/>traction degrees of the false components n and n <lb/>  (0 ≤ <lb/> n, n <lb/> ≤ 7) for the nucleus <lb/> 36  Ar chosen as an example. <lb/>The values obtained using the BCS theory are respectively <lb/> ΔN  BCS  = 0.09 and E  BCS  = −648.78 MeV.

It is <lb/>thus very far from the theoretical overlap. <lb/>iii) The particle-number fluctuations are efficiently elimi-<lb/>nated since the quantity ΔN that was 0.09 with the <lb/>BCS theory vanishes after projection. <lb/>iv) The energy value is significantly reduced with regard <lb/>to the BCS one (the difference is more than 11 MeV). <lb/> 4.3 Effects of the particle-number fluctuations on the <lb/>system energy <lb/> In order to evaluate the particle-number fluctuations effect <lb/>on the system energy, we have calculated the difference <lb/>between the projected and BCS energies, <lb/> δE <lb/> np  = E  nn   − E <lb/> np <lb/>BCS  , <lb/> (26) <lb/>for the ground state of the previously cited nuclei. The ob-<lb/>tained values are compared in table 2 to those of the same <lb/>quantity, when only the pairing between like-particles is <lb/>taken into account, i.e. <lb/> δE = E  n  − E  BCS  , <lb/> (27) <lb/>where E  n  is the energy evaluated using the SBCS particle-<lb/>number projection method [33,34,38]. <lb/>It then appears that the particle-number fluctuations <lb/>effects are even more important when the np pairing is <lb/>considered. Indeed, the δE value is on average −4.62 MeV, <lb/>whereas that of δE <lb/> np  is −10.61 MeV. <lb/>We have also reported in the same table the overlap <lb/>between the BCS and projected wave functions without <lb/>(Ψ |Ψ  n   p  and Ψ |Ψ  n   n  for the proton and neutron systems, <lb/>respectively) and with (Ψ |Ψ  nn   ) inclusion of the np pair-<lb/>ing correlations. Here again, it appears that the particle-<lb/>number fluctuations are even more important when the <lb/>np correlations are included. Indeed, the average value of <lb/> Ψ |Ψ  n   p  or Ψ |Ψ  n   n  is 57%, whereas that of Ψ |Ψ  nn   is <lb/>only 34%. <lb/>These facts show the necessity of both the inclusion <lb/>of the np pairing correlations and the particle-number <lb/>projection in N  Z nuclei. It will be the case in the <lb/>astrophysical context and specially for the study of the <lb/>rp-process. Indeed, as underlined in the introduction, this <lb/>study is not only hindered by the uncertainty of the astro-<lb/>physical conditions but also by the lack of experimental <lb/>information on the nuclei along this process. The theoret-<lb/>ical predictions have thus to be particularly rigorous. <lb/>Finally, it is worth noticing that the present particle-<lb/>number projection method could be easily generalized to <lb/>the excited states and hence used for the double-beta de-<lb/>cay study. <lb/></body>

The structure of the neutron-rich nucleus <lb/> 47  Ar has been investigated through the d( <lb/> 46  Ar, <lb/> 47  Ar)p <lb/>transfer reaction. The radioactive beam of <lb/> 46  Ar at 10 A · MeV was provided by the SPIRAL facility at <lb/>GANIL. The protons corresponding to a neutron pick-up on bound or unbound states mechanism in <lb/> 47  Ar <lb/>nuclei were detected at backward angles by the position-sensitive Si array-detector MUST. The transfer-<lb/>like ejectiles were detected in the SPEG spectrometer. Level scheme, spin assignments and spectroscopic <lb/>factors have been deduced for <lb/> 47  Ar and compared to shell model predictions. They suggest a slight erosion <lb/>of the N = 28 shell gap from the weakening of the spin-orbit interaction arising from the f and p orbitals. <lb/>These spectroscopic information are subsequently used to infer (n, γ) reaction rates in the Ar isotopic <lb/>chain to understand the origin of the <lb/> 48  Ca/ <lb/> 46  Ca abnormal isotopic ratio observed in certain inclusions of <lb/>meteorites. <lb/> PACS. 21.10.Hw Spin, parity, and isobaric spin – 21.10.Jx Spectroscopic factors – 25.60.Je Transfer <lb/>reactions – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae and other explosive environments <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The role of the spin-orbit interaction is essential to cre-<lb/>ate the magic numbers as N = 28, revealed for instance <lb/>in the doubly magic nucleus <lb/> 48  Ca. This interaction lowers <lb/>the f  7/2  neutron orbit just into the middle of the gap be-<lb/>tween the sd and fp oscillator shells, resulting in a neutron <lb/>magic number at N = 28. The ordering of the neutron or-<lb/>bitals around N = 28 (f  7/2  , p  3/2  , p  1/2  and f  5/2  ) exhibits <lb/>2 pairs of spin-orbit partners originating from the f and p <lb/> states. A differential change in the size of these two pairs <lb/>of orbitals could enhance or reduce the N = 28 gap. A <lb/>strong reduction of the f spin-orbit splitting, as compared <lb/>to the p one, would erode the N = 28 gap. This would <lb/>create particle-hole (ph) excitations between orbitals of <lb/>the same oscillator shell f  7/2  and p  3/2  which are strongly <lb/> a  e-mail: gaudefroy@ganil.fr <lb/> connected by quadrupole interactions. Thus, even a small <lb/>amount of excitations across N = 28 may lead to perma-<lb/>nent quadrupole deformation. Therefore, the emergence of <lb/>deformed nuclei with N = 28 is intimately related to the <lb/>strength of the spin-orbit interaction. <lb/>Recent experimental data suggest an erosion of the <lb/> N = 28 shell in very neutron-rich nuclei. According <lb/>to β-decay [1] and Coulomb-excitation [2] experiments, <lb/>quadru-pole ground-state deformation develops at Z = 16 <lb/>four protons below the doubly magic <lb/> 48  Ca. Study of <lb/>the neutron-rich <lb/> 40−44  S using the in-beam γ-spectroscopy <lb/> technique [3] suggests deformed ground states for <lb/> 40,42  S <lb/>and a mixed deformed configuration for <lb/> 44  S in accor-<lb/>dance with both the mean-field [4,5,6,7,8] and the re-<lb/>cent large-scale shell model calculations [9]. A 0 <lb/> + <lb/>2  level (of <lb/>mainly 2p2h origin) was tentatively assigned at an energy <lb/>of 2.7 MeV in <lb/> 46  Ar [10], as compared to 4.28 MeV in <lb/> 48  Ca. <lb/>The recent finding of a 0 <lb/> + <lb/>2  at 1.365 keV in <lb/> 44  S shows that <lb/></body>

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> the decrease of the 0 <lb/> + <lb/> 2  level has continued with the removal <lb/>of protons in the sd shell. The large ρ <lb/> 2  (E0 : 0 <lb/> + <lb/>2  → 0 <lb/> + <lb/>1  ) <lb/>points towards the existence of two strongly interacting <lb/>states with very different shapes in <lb/> 44  S. This witnesses <lb/>that the N = 28 gap has been overcome by ph excitations <lb/>to generate permanent quadrupole deformation. <lb/>To understand the erosion of the N = 28 shell gap <lb/>south to <lb/> 48  Ca, and its probable link to a reduced spin-<lb/>orbit splitting, it is essential to see the evolution of the <lb/> f  7/2  , p  3/2  , p  1/2  and f  5/2  orbitals in the <lb/> 46  Ar nucleus. The <lb/>tensor monopole interaction [11] could be responsible for <lb/>this reduction. It acts in the present case between the <lb/>protons in the sd shell (mainly in the d  3/2  orbital) and <lb/>the neutrons in the two f  7/2  -f  5/2  and p  3/2  - p  1/2  spin-orbit <lb/>partners. As protons are removed from the d  3/2  orbital, <lb/>the spin-orbit splittings are weakened. To see if such an <lb/>effect is observed in the N = 28 region we should com-<lb/>pare the neutron single-particle energies in the <lb/> 49  Ca and <lb/> 47  Ar isotones. In <lb/> 49  Ca the size of the spin-orbit splitting <lb/>between the p orbits is of about 2 MeV, and the main <lb/>component of the f  5/2  strength lies at 3.9 MeV excitation <lb/>energy (referenced to the p  3/2  ground state (g.s.)). The <lb/>present goal of the d( <lb/> 46  Ar, <lb/> 47  Ar)p transfer reaction is to <lb/>obtain similar information in <lb/> 47  Ar. To achieve this goal, <lb/>we have used the newly operating SPIRAL facility to pro-<lb/>duce a radioactive beam of <lb/> 46  Ar. <lb/>The study of the N = 28 shell closure is expected <lb/>to shed some light on the hitherto mysterious anomalies <lb/>observed in certain meteorites, as the large <lb/> 48  Ca/ <lb/> 46  Ca ra-<lb/>tio. The present study aims to deduce radiative neutron-<lb/>capture rates in the Ar isotopic chain from the spectro-<lb/>scopic information obtained through the (d, p) transfer re-<lb/>action. Astrophysical consequences are subsequently dis-<lb/>cussed. <lb/> 2 Experimental methods <lb/> The transfer reaction d( <lb/> 46  Ar, <lb/> 47  Ar)p has been performed <lb/>at GANIL with a radioactive beam of <lb/> 46  Ar produced <lb/>by the SPIRAL facility. This beam has been produced <lb/>through the projectile fragmentation of a 66 A · MeV <lb/> 48  Ca <lb/>primary beam of about 200 pnA intensity in a thick car-<lb/>bon target located at the underground production cave of <lb/>SPIRAL. The isotopes of interest were produced into the <lb/>target which was heated at 2000 K in order to favor their <lb/>extraction. They were subsequently ionized by an ECR <lb/>source to the charge 9 <lb/> +  and accelerated by the cyclotron <lb/>CIME up to the energy of 10 A · MeV. The beam intensity <lb/>of <lb/> 46  Ar was 2 · 10 <lb/> 4  s <lb/> −1  , without isobaric contamination. In <lb/>addition to this, a stable beam of <lb/> 40  Ar has been produced <lb/>by the same devices at similar energy in order to validate <lb/>our analysis of the pick-up (d, p) reaction with a known <lb/>case studied in direct kinematics [12]. The total number of <lb/> 40  Ar and <lb/> 46  Ar nuclei which crossed the target was 2 · 10 <lb/> 9 <lb/> and 4 · 10 <lb/> 9  , respectively. <lb/>Neutron pick-up reactions (d, p) were induced by a <lb/>380 μg · cm <lb/> −2  thick CD  2  target. The tracking of the sec-<lb/>ondary beams was achieved by a position-sensitive gas-<lb/>filled detector CATS [13] located 11 cm downstream the <lb/> F.P.

We have reconstructed the impact points of the <lb/>nuclei on the target with an accuracy of 1.0 mm. Pro-<lb/>tons were detected at backward angles (between 110 and <lb/>170 degrees) using the 8 position-sensitive MUST tele-<lb/>scopes [14]. By measuring the energies (from 0.3 to 6 MeV) <lb/>and angles of the protons, the two-body pick-up reac-<lb/>tion can be characterized. The beam-like transfer products <lb/>were selected by the SPEG [15] spectrometer and identi-<lb/>fied at its dispersive focal plane through their position (see <lb/>fig. 1 top), energy loss and time-of-flight information. In <lb/>order to obtain the energy spectrum of <lb/> 47  Ar ( <lb/> 46  Ar), we <lb/>have used the measured proton energy and angle in the <lb/>relativistic kinematics formula. <lb/>The experimental proton angular distributions have <lb/>been compared to those obtained with DWBA calcu-<lb/>lations using the DWUCK4 code [16] to deduce the <lb/> value and spectroscopic factor (SF) of each identified level <lb/>(fig. 2). Several optical potentials have been used to see <lb/>their influence on the SF values. It was found that, de-<lb/>pending on the potential, the SF vary within about 20% <lb/>around a mean value. We have considered two different po-<lb/>tentials for both the entrance and exit channels, and used <lb/>the four combinations between them to describe the (d, p) <lb/>reaction. The (d+ <lb/> 46  Ar) channel was described by using <lb/>the deuteron global optical potential parametrization of <lb/>W.W. Daehnick et al. [17] (denoted as D1 in the following) <lb/>or the adiabatical deuteron potential of G.L. Wales and <lb/>R.C. Johnson [18] (D2) which takes into account the effect <lb/>of the deuteron break-up. The deuteron potential is de-<lb/>scribed with a combination of neutron and proton poten-<lb/>tials (CH89 [19]) for the parametrization of the break-up. <lb/></body>

Prior to the present work only the mass excess <lb/>(Δm) and beta-decay half-life of <lb/> 47  Ar were known. How-<lb/>ever, the use of tabulated value Δm = −25.9(1) MeV for <lb/> 47  Ar [21] would shift by 600 keV the peak corresponding <lb/>to the p  3/2  ground state (g.s.). Since the method to de-<lb/>duce the excitation spectrum has been proven to be suc-<lb/>cessful already to deduce the whole excitation spectra of <lb/> 41,45  Ar [22], we would suggest a new mass-excess value of <lb/> Δm = −25.3(2) MeV for <lb/> 47  Ar to bring back the g.s. level <lb/>to zero excitation energy as shown in fig. 1. This new mass-<lb/>excess leads to a neutron separation energy (S  n  ) in <lb/> 47  Ar <lb/>of 3.7(2) MeV instead of 4.25(14) MeV. The full width at <lb/>half maximum of the g.s. peak is 420 keV. With this en-<lb/>ergy resolution, an unfolding procedure is often required <lb/>to separate several peaks which lie at nearby energies. Two <lb/>Gaussian distributions centered at 1.1(2) and 1.8(2) MeV <lb/>are used to reproduce the observed structure between 0.8 <lb/>and 2.2 MeV. In the same manner, three Gaussians cen-<lb/>tered at 2.7(2), 3.3(2) and 3.8(2) MeV are required to re-<lb/>produce the broad structure around 3 MeV. As in the case <lb/>of <lb/> 45  Ar [22], well-defined structures are still visible in <lb/> 47  Ar <lb/>above the neutron separation energy value S  n  . This indi-<lb/> Table 1.

Two components of orbital momenta  = 1 <lb/>and  = 3 have to been used to fit the states at 1.1(2) MeV <lb/>and 1.8(2) MeV. We tentatively assign the configurations <lb/> p  1/2  and f  7/2  to the states at 1.1(2) MeV and 1.8(2) MeV, <lb/>respectively. The spectroscopic factor of the p  1/2  state is <lb/>close to unity, indicating its quasi-pure single neutron con-<lb/>figuration added to the <lb/> 46  Ar core. The intruder state 7/2 <lb/> − <lb/> built on a (νp  3/2  ) <lb/> 2  (νf  7/2  ) <lb/> −1  configuration has a spectro-<lb/>scopic factor of 0.16 in <lb/> 47  Ar. The experimental energies <lb/>and spectroscopic factors of the g.s. and first excited states <lb/>compare very well with SM calculations. The SF value of <lb/>the intruder configuration also agrees very well, but the <lb/>level lies about 400 keV above the calculated value. This <lb/>indicates that SM calculations either slightly underesti-<lb/>mate the size of the N = 28 gap or overestimate pair-<lb/>ing/correlation energies gained by promoting a neutron <lb/>in the p  3/2  orbital in <lb/> 47  Ar. The present result will help <lb/>for better understanding the onset of collectivity in the <lb/> Z = 16 nuclei through intruder excitations. It is also in-<lb/>teresting to compare the spin-orbit splitting between the <lb/> p  1/2  and p  3/2  states which is reduced from about 2 MeV <lb/>in <lb/> 49  Ca to 1.2 MeV in <lb/> 47  Ar, as two protons are removed <lb/>from the quasi-degenerated proton d  3/2  and s  1/2  orbitals. <lb/>The origin of this decrease of spin-orbit splitting with the <lb/>removal of d  3/2  protons could be ascribed to the tensor <lb/>monopole force [11] which acts in opposite sign between <lb/>the two orbitals p  1/2  and p  3/2  . <lb/>The fit of the experimental angular distribution lo-<lb/>cated around 3 MeV excitation energy requires the pres-<lb/>ence of at least three states, and an admixture of  = 3 <lb/>and/or  = 4 components as shown in table 1. This is in <lb/>nice agreement with the SM calculations. Another solu-<lb/>tion of the fit leads to a much higher  = 4 SF of 0.76. <lb/>However this value is very unlikely as the SF of the g  9/2 <lb/> orbital is weaker than 0.2 in <lb/> 49  Ca and never exceeds 0.6 <lb/>at that excitation energy in the N = 29 isotones. From <lb/>the present assumption, it is found that the components <lb/>of the f  5/2  orbital are lowered by about 500 keV between <lb/> 49  Ca and <lb/> 47  Ar. This could be an effect of the reduction of <lb/>the spin-orbit splitting between the f  7/2  and f  5/2  orbitals, <lb/>which is evidenced through the lowering of the f  5/2  orbital <lb/>with respect to the p  3/2  g.s. <lb/>We have used the same interaction, sdpf , to calculate <lb/>the level scheme of <lb/> 49  Ar (fig. 3), which is currently not <lb/>reachable via (d, p) reaction as the intensity of <lb/> 48  Ar beam <lb/>is too weak. Given the good agreement between calculated <lb/>and experimental levels in <lb/> 45,47  Ar (see ref. [22] for <lb/> 45  Ar), <lb/>we expect to obtain reliable predictions for the case of <lb/> 49  Ar whose astrophysical interest will be emphasized in <lb/>the next section. This nucleus exhibits two low-energy p  3/2 <lb/> and p  1/2  states with SF of 0.23 and 0.77, respectively. In <lb/> 48  Ar  30  the p  3/2  is in principle half-filled. Therefore a SF <lb/>of 0.23 carries about 50% of the p  3/2  total strength. The <lb/>first excited state carries almost all the p  1/2  strength. It <lb/>is shifted down by about 1 MeV as compared to the <lb/> 47  Ar <lb/>because of the pairing energy gain of the 2 holes in the <lb/> p  3/2  orbital when promoting a neutron in the p  1/2  shell. <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> − <lb/>3/2 <lb/>− <lb/>7/2 <lb/>− <lb/>5/2 <lb/>− <lb/>3/2 <lb/>− <lb/>5/2 <lb/>− <lb/> Ar <lb/>SM calcul. <lb/> 49 <lb/> (0.23) <lb/>144 (0.77) <lb/>0 <lb/>780 (0.10) <lb/>1019 (0.14) <lb/>1350 (0.08) <lb/>2117 (0.48) <lb/> Fig. 3.

We have applied <lb/>a procedure similar to that described in ref. [26] for the <lb/>case of <lb/> 48  Ca to calculate the neutron capture cross section <lb/>in the Ar isotopic chain. It was pointed out in <lb/> 48  Ca that <lb/>95% of the cross section is of Direct Capture (DC) origin, <lb/>which was ascribed to the intrinsic structure of the <lb/> 49  Ca <lb/>g.s. which exhibits a low angular momentum and a large <lb/>spectroscopic factor. The contribution of resonant capture <lb/>to unbound states was negligible since the level density at <lb/>the S  n  value is low. Predictions in the Ar isotopic chain <lb/>around N = 28 depend strongly on the nuclear structure <lb/>of <lb/> 46  Ar nucleus. In particular, the neutron-capture rates <lb/>depend on the SF of the low-energy p states, the S  n  value <lb/>and the level density above the latter. These three points <lb/>are examined in the following. <lb/>Taking into account the spin-conservation rules in the <lb/>DC reaction, the neutron is mainly captured into  = 1 <lb/>bound states through the E1 operator without centrifugal <lb/>barrier as the transferred angular momentum is  n  = 0 <lb/>(s-wave capture). The ratio between s-wave (final state <lb/>with  = 1) and d-wave (final state with  = 3) direct <lb/>neutron-capture rate is approximately 10 <lb/> 4  in the present <lb/>nuclei [27]. Therefore the s-wave DC to the g.s. and first <lb/>excited states that have both large spectroscopic factors <lb/>and  = 1 values dominates over all other contributions. <lb/>Moreover, in an s-wave capture, the velocity dependence <lb/>of the cross section is known to be 1/v, and the Maxwell-<lb/>average neutron capture rate (MACS = Naσv, with Na <lb/></body>

It defines the Q-value of the (n, γ) reaction <lb/>to the bound states in the <lb/> 45,47,49  Ar nuclei. Owing to the <lb/>known mass-excesses of <lb/> 44,45,46  Ar and the newly deter-<lb/>mined one of <lb/> 47  Ar, we can determine the reaction Q-values <lb/> for the <lb/> 44,46  Ar neutron captures with sufficient precision. <lb/>In the case of <lb/> 49  Ar, only extrapolated value exists [21]. <lb/>The large uncertainty of about 800 keV on the Q-value <lb/> (2.5(8) MeV for a capture to the g.s.) implies a large un-<lb/>certainty in the calculation of the neutron-capture rate on <lb/> 48  Ar, as shown in fig. 4. <lb/>Well-defined energy peaks are still present above the <lb/>neutron emission threshold in both <lb/> 45  Ar and <lb/> 47  Ar nuclei. <lb/>This means that the statistical treatment of neutron cap-<lb/>tures using the Hauser-Feshbach formalism is no longer <lb/>valid for these light nuclei, close to magic numbers. In-<lb/>stead, individual resonances should be considered. As the <lb/>centrifugal barrier will strongly hinder neutron-captures <lb/>on orbitals of high angular momenta, we have to search <lb/>for resonances with low-values in the vicinity of the neu-<lb/>tron separation energy. As mentioned above, no state with <lb/> ≤ 1 has been found, making the resonant capture a neg-<lb/>ligible process for these nuclei. <lb/>The direct neutron capture rates on <lb/> 44,46  Ar have been <lb/>calculated using the procedure described in ref. [26] and <lb/>the experimental spectroscopic information presented here <lb/>and in ref. [22]. As the DC process mainly occurs at the <lb/>surface of the nucleus, the choice of an appropriate nu-<lb/>clear density distribution is important. These have been <lb/>obtained from mean-field calculations using HFB formal-<lb/>ism in a spherical geometry [28]. These distributions re-<lb/>produce remarkably well the measured root mean square <lb/>radii of <lb/> 44,46  Ar [29]. The neutron capture rate on <lb/> 48  Ar was <lb/>deduced from the calculated structure of <lb/> 49  Ar, presented <lb/>in the previous section. The calculated MACS are shown <lb/>in fig. 4. A MACS ratio of about 5 occurs between A = 44 <lb/>and A = 46, and a more pronounced one (10 to 50 depend-<lb/>ing on the S  n  value in <lb/> 49  Ar) between A = 46 and A = 48. <lb/>Mass measurements of the neutron-rich <lb/> 48,49  Ar isotopes <lb/>are of great interest to infer the <lb/> 48  Ar(n, γ) rate with bet-<lb/>ter accuracy. From our results summarized in fig. 4, it <lb/>arises that nuclear structure (i.e. the presence of low an-<lb/>gular momenta states —  = 1 — with closed to one SF <lb/>and high binding energies) speed-up the neutron capture <lb/>at A = 46 (as compared to A = 48), despite the presence <lb/>of the N = 28 shell closure. <lb/> 5 Astrophysical implications <lb/> About two decades ago, G.J. Wasserburg and his group <lb/>at Caltech identified correlated isotopic anomalies for the <lb/>neutron-rich <lb/> 48  Ca, <lb/> 50  Ti and <lb/> 54  Cr isotopes in peculiar re-<lb/>fractory inclusions of the Allende meteorite [30,31]. As an <lb/>example, the <lb/> 48  Ca/ <lb/> 46  Ca ratio was found to be 250, a factor <lb/>of 5 larger than in the Solar System. It was concluded that <lb/>these highly unusual isotopic compositions witness late-<lb/>stage nucleosynthesis processes which preceded the for-<lb/>mation of the solar nebula. However, astrophysical models <lb/>existing at that time encountered severe difficulties when <lb/>trying to reproduce these observed anomalies, in partic-<lb/>ular those in the EK-1-4-1 inclusions. Since that time <lb/>major progresses have been made in particular on mass <lb/>measurements, β-decay lifetimes of unstable nuclei and <lb/>neutron-capture cross sections on stable and unstable nu-<lb/>clei (present work). We now gather all information to see <lb/>which stellar conditions could account for these observa-<lb/>tions. <lb/>A plausible astrophysical scenario to account for the <lb/>overabundance of <lb/> 48  Ca is a weak rapid neutron-capture <lb/>process [32,27]. There the neutron-rich stable <lb/> 46,48  Ca iso-<lb/>topes are produced during a neutron-capture and β-decay <lb/> process. The main contribution to the production of these <lb/>Ca isotopes is provided by the β-decay of their progeni-<lb/>tor isobars in the Ar isotopic chain [27]. This was traced <lb/>back from the fact that, in the Z &lt; 18 chains, the mea-<lb/>sured β-decay lifetimes of <lb/> 44  S and <lb/> 45  Cl are shorter than <lb/>the neutron-capture rates at the N = 28 shell closure. <lb/>Consequently, the matter flow in the S and Cl chains is <lb/>depleted by β-decay to the upper Z isotopes before reach-<lb/>ing masses A = 46 or 48. It was noted earlier that this <lb/>feature arises from the erosion of the N = 28 shell gap <lb/>in the S and Cl isotopic chains [1]. Thus the main pro-<lb/>genitors of <lb/> 46,48  Ca are produced either directly in the Ar <lb/>chain or from the β-decay of Z &lt; 18 nuclei which sub-<lb/>sequently could capture neutrons in the Ar chain. There-<lb/>fore the determination of neutron-capture rates in the Ar <lb/>isotopes is important. Competition between the neutron <lb/>capture and β-decay reactions is reflected by the reac-<lb/>tion mean times. The mean neutron capture time t  n  can <lb/>be expressed as t  n  = 1/(d  n  σv). Knowing the β-decay <lb/> half lives and neutron capture rates in the nuclei of inter-<lb/>est, we can deduce an approximative value of the neutron <lb/>density, d  n  , which could account for the large observed <lb/>isotopic ratio <lb/> 48  Ca/ <lb/> 46  Ca = 250 in the weak r-process <lb/></body>

The mean rate value of <lb/> 49  Ar has been taken to deduce its neutron capture mean time. <lb/>Isotope Naσv <lb/>tn <lb/>T <lb/> β <lb/> 1/2 <lb/>44  Ar <lb/>6.19 10 <lb/> 6 <lb/> 2.8 10 <lb/> −5  s 11.9 min <lb/> 46  Ar <lb/>4.04 10 <lb/> 3 <lb/> 45 ms <lb/>7.8 s <lb/> 48  Ar <lb/>2.03 10 <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1 s <lb/>0.45 s <lb/> temperature range (T  9  = 0.1 to  5). Such a neutron <lb/>density would give rise to a neutron capture mean time, <lb/> t <lb/> 46  Ar <lb/> n <lb/> , on <lb/> 46  Ar which favors the capture reaction in com-<lb/>parison to the β-decay one. This can be expressed by the <lb/>relation 1 − exp( <lb/> − ln 2·t <lb/> 46 Ar <lb/> n <lb/> 7.8 <lb/> ) = 1/250 which leads to a t <lb/> 46  Ar <lb/> n <lb/> value of about 45 ms implying a neutron density of about <lb/>3 · 10 <lb/> 21  cm <lb/> −3  . Table 2 presents the neutron capture mean <lb/>times corresponding to that neutron density, as well as the <lb/> β-decay half lives. <lb/>At A = 48, calculated t  n  becomes longer than T <lb/> β <lb/> 1/2  . <lb/>Consequently the neutron capture is halted in the Ar chain <lb/>at A = 48, accumulating substantial amount of <lb/> 48  Ca. Con-<lb/>versely, few depletion occurs through β-decay at A = 46 <lb/>as the lifetime of <lb/> 46  Ar is longer than neutron capture time. <lb/>These two features can account for explaining the observed <lb/>high <lb/> 48  Ca/ <lb/> 46  Ca ratio. More realistic nucleosynthesis net-<lb/>work calculations are in progress in order to confirm or <lb/>otherwise the naive picture drawn. <lb/> 6 Conclusions <lb/> Spectroscopic information has been obtained in <lb/> 47  Ar  29  using the d( <lb/> 46  Ar, <lb/> 47  Ar)p transfer reaction at <lb/>GANIL/SPIRAL. We have used the position-sensitive <lb/>MUST detector for the protons and the SPEG spec-<lb/>trometer to select and identify the transfer-like nuclei <lb/> 47  Ar. Energies and angular distributions of hitherto <lb/>unknown levels in <lb/> 47  Ar have been determined for the <lb/>first time. A new value of the mass-excess of <lb/> 47  Ar, <lb/> Δm = −25.3(2) MeV, is proposed. The two components <lb/>of the spin-orbit splitting p  3/2  and p  1/2  have been identi-<lb/>fied at low excitation energies in <lb/> 47  Ar. The approximate <lb/>location of the f  5/2  strength has been determined too. <lb/>These data point to a weakening of the p and f spin-orbit <lb/>splittings, the latter being responsible for the reduction <lb/>of the N = 28 shell gap. The intruder configuration 2p1h <lb/>across the N = 28 gap has been observed at 1.8(2) MeV. <lb/>Its energy will constrain the size of the N = 28 gap <lb/>in <lb/> 47  Ar and the amount of correlations. Comparison <lb/>between experimental results and shell model calculations <lb/>shows a very good agreement, except for the location <lb/>of the intruder state whose calculated energy is 400 keV <lb/>lower. Combining the present information and the one <lb/>obtained on <lb/> 45  Ar  27  [22], we deduce that the magicity at <lb/>the N = 28 shell closure is preserved at <lb/> 46  Ar. The stel-<lb/>lar neutron capture rates <lb/> 44,46  Ar(n, γ) <lb/> 45,47  Ar have been <lb/>deduced using our data obtained from the (d, p) reac-<lb/>tion. A nearby extrapolation led to the estimation of <lb/> 48  Ar(n, γ) <lb/> 49  Ar rate. It is shown that nuclear structure <lb/>does matter for a correct determination of these cap-<lb/>ture rates. A fast(slow) neutron-capture rate is found for <lb/> 46  Ar( <lb/> 48  Ar). In a weak r-process scenario, with neutron <lb/>density of about 3 · 10 <lb/> 21  cm <lb/> −3  , the matter flow in the Ar <lb/>chain is slightly depleted at A = 46 and accumulated at <lb/> A = 48. This would result, after β-decay of the unsta-<lb/>ble Ar isotopes to an overproduction of the stable <lb/> 48  Ca <lb/>as compared to <lb/> 46  Ca, as is observed in certain refractory <lb/>inclusions of the Allende meteorite. <lb/></body>

TACTIC (TACTIC web site: http://tactic.triumf.ca) is a new detector for low-energy nu-<lb/>clear reactions currently under development at TRIUMF. The cylindrical ionization chamber allows three-<lb/>dimensional reconstruction of particle tracks by means of a two-dimensional anode array combined with a <lb/>TOF measurement of the drift electrons. In addition, the integrated charge for each pulse provides informa-<lb/>tion about the energy loss of the particle and therefore allows a better identification of the nuclear species <lb/>producing the track. The geometry of TACTIC covers a large angular range permitting the measurement <lb/>of differential cross-sections over a large solid angle. It will be ideal for investigations of nuclear processes <lb/>pertinent to the field of nuclear astrophysics. <lb/> PACS. 25.55.-e <lb/> 3  H-, <lb/> 3  He-, and <lb/> 4  He-induced reactions – 29.40.Cs Gas-filled counters: ionization chambers, <lb/>proportional, and avalanche counters – 29.40.Gx Tracking and position-sensitive detectors <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> With the advent of radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities <lb/>many reactions have to be measured in inverse kinematics. <lb/>For capture reactions, the cone of the ejected heavy ions <lb/>is usually sufficiently small so that a recoil separator can <lb/>be used for detecting 100% of the ions. For reactions with <lb/>two or more heavy ejectiles, the cone is larger and a detec-<lb/>tor array like TUDA [1] is the better option. However, a <lb/>fraction of the angular range is lost for small angles in or-<lb/>der to let the beam through, and for larger angles where <lb/>the ejectiles do not reach the detector. When using gas <lb/>targets, if the energy of the ejectiles is low they cannot <lb/>penetrate the gas and/or the exit window and also lose <lb/>energy in the dead layer of the detector. <lb/>Another approach to cover a large forward angular <lb/>range is to use an ionization chamber. The problem here <lb/>is that the target and detection region are not separated, <lb/>resulting in a large background and poor statistics. High <lb/>segmentation is needed in order to collect as many track <lb/>points as possible and this would require several ampli-<lb/>fying gas cells as well as amplification and digitalization <lb/>electronics. <lb/>Our approach is to employ Gas Electron Multiplier <lb/>(GEM) [2,3] foils for the first stage of amplification inside <lb/>the chamber. This considerably reduces the complexity <lb/> a  e-mail: ruprecht@triumf.ca <lb/> of a cylindrical chamber design which in turn makes a <lb/>separation of target and detection region more feasible. <lb/> 2 The TACTIC chamber <lb/> The TRIUMF Annular Chamber for the Tracking and <lb/>Identification of Charged Particles (TACTIC) is a com-<lb/>bined cylindrical ionization (IC)/time projection chamber <lb/>(TPC) detector where the gas target along the central axis <lb/>can be &quot; windowless &quot; to ejectiles (i.e. the target and detec-<lb/>tor gases are the same), or &quot; windowed &quot; (i.e. a thin window <lb/>separates disparate target and detector gases). In either <lb/>case field-defining cathode wires delimit the target region. <lb/>Using this method, the beginning part of the track within <lb/>the target region cannot be &quot; seen &quot; in the drift region, but <lb/>the vertex point can still be inferred by extrapolating the <lb/>reconstructed TPC anode hits. The total energy deposited <lb/>by the stopping ejectiles is also measured by the accumu-<lb/>lated charge on the anodes. Furthermore, using the vertex <lb/>reconstruction, the energy loss of the beam in the tar-<lb/>get allows the simultaneous measurement of cross-sections <lb/>and angular distributions over a range of energies. <lb/>The GEM foil [2,3] acts as a preamplifier inside the <lb/>chamber wall providing low-noise signals requiring only <lb/>one further stage of amplification. The signals are digitized <lb/>using a multi-channel VME-based flash ADC board, thus <lb/>minimizing the amount of electronics required. <lb/></body>

The source was mounted 5 cm before the first <lb/>strip. The first strip signal was used as the trigger, so all <lb/>track times are with respect to the first strip. <lb/>In a second phase, the gas pressure was varied down <lb/>to 100 mbar while keeping the He/CO  2  mixture at a con-<lb/>stant ratio (below 100 mbar the oxygen contamination be-<lb/>comes too high and quenches the signals) and the flow <lb/>rate at 200 cm <lb/> 3  /min.

To study <lb/>the mutual dependence of all these parameters a Monte-<lb/>Carlo simulation of all relevant processes taking part in <lb/>the chamber was performed using the GEANT4 frame-<lb/>work [4]. The most important questions to be answered <lb/>from the simulation are <lb/> – How accurately can the reaction vertex point be re-<lb/>constructed from the anode signals? This is important <lb/>because the interaction energy must be well known for <lb/>measurements below the Coulomb threshold. <lb/> – What is the angular resolution? <lb/> – What is the energy resolution? <lb/> – When the emission of low-energetic gammas is ex-<lb/>pected, what attenuation can be expected at the <lb/>gamma detectors placed outside the chamber? <lb/></body>

			<body> laboratory angle of 20 <lb/> •  there is a large uncertainty for <lb/>the c.m. angle (between 70 <lb/> •  and 150 <lb/> •  ). This calculation <lb/>is based on a simple linear least squares fit of the radial <lb/>distances expected to be measured with the anodes (the <lb/>error of the drift time is not currently included in the <lb/>simulation). The uncertainty comes from the z-resolution <lb/> as well as from the beam and ejectile straggling. With a <lb/>more sophisticated analysis (e.g. giving smaller radii more <lb/>weight) an improvement is possible. Again, no energy sig-<lb/>nals have been taken into account which can further refine <lb/>the analysis. <lb/>The simulation is a crucial contribution for the de-<lb/>tector design as well as for later experimental analysis. <lb/>Further refinements are required to be able to obtain re-<lb/>liable statements about the vertex reconstruction and en-<lb/>ergy resolution. The estimates presented here have been <lb/>done without taking the drift time uncertainties into ac-<lb/>count. The latter can be calculated using GARFIELD [6]. <lb/>Combining GEANT4 with GARFIELD, a simulation of <lb/>the anode signal shape can be achieved providing a fur-<lb/>ther piece of information from the particles. <lb/>We have implemented the software for low-energy re-<lb/>actions (C++ objects) in a generic manner that can be <lb/>used for other GEANT4 applications as well. As detectors <lb/>for nuclear reactions become more complex, this will be a <lb/>helpful contribution to the GEANT4 repository that other <lb/>nuclear physics groups could use for detector simulation <lb/>or analysis. <lb/> 5 Drift field and beam induced electrons <lb/> Electrons induced directly by the beam could potentially <lb/>drift from the target region to the detection region where <lb/>they produce unwanted signals. To avoid this, a second <lb/>cage of wires held at a slightly more positive voltage will be <lb/>inserted a few mm inside the cathode wire cage, fully en-<lb/>compassing the expected incident beam spread. A GAR-<lb/>FIELD [6] calculation has shown that electrons released <lb/>in the target region will be collected at the inner cage and <lb/>not drift to the detection region (see fig. 10). <lb/></body>

The <lb/>radii of the cathode cage and of the GEM cylinder are 10 mm <lb/>and 50 mm, respectively. <lb/> An accurate measurement of the drift time demands <lb/>a uniform electric field within TACTIC. Since the enclo-<lb/>sure outside the end caps is electrically grounded, the drift <lb/>field is distorted close to the end caps. Therefore, the field <lb/>near the endcaps must be shaped by appropriately biased <lb/>rings (see fig. 2). Figure 11 shows the field uniformity im-<lb/>provement by using three rings. The electric field has been <lb/>calculated using FEMLAB [7] and the total drift time was <lb/>obtained by integrating along the field lines, assuming a <lb/>linear approximation for the drift velocity given in [8] for <lb/>a 90/10 mixture of Ar/CO  2  . <lb/> 6 Data acquisition <lb/> We will use flash ADCs for the data acquisition —a <lb/>new technique that is becoming more popular for nuclear <lb/>physics applications. The entire anode signal is sampled <lb/>and can be stored for later analysis. For the TACTIC pro-<lb/>totype we will use a 48-channel VME board with a sam-<lb/>pling rate of 40–70 MHz and a resolution of 10 bits per <lb/>sample. However, due to the large data rate it is desirable <lb/>to extract time and charge information immediately pro-<lb/>ceeding the digitalization. The firmware running on the <lb/>VME board offers a large number of configuration possi-<lb/>bilities based on custom analysis algorithms. This feature <lb/>is required because the pulse shapes differ depending on <lb/>the direction of the recoil. <lb/>The raw charge and time data provided by the flash <lb/>ADC board will be stored and pre-analysed using TRI-<lb/>UMF&apos;s MIDAS [9] system. DAQ systems for nuclear phy-<lb/>sics usually lack the ability to display particle tracks, so <lb/>a more sophisticated analysis system, ROOT [10], will <lb/>be used. There also exists a new MIDAS/ROOT inter-<lb/>face, ROME [11], which is still under development at PSI, <lb/>Switzerland. We are currently testing the suitability of <lb/>these tools for this kind of particle tracking experiment. <lb/> 7 Applications <lb/> The first experiment planned to be measured with TAC-<lb/>TIC is the <lb/> 8  Li(α, n) <lb/> 11  B reaction which plays a role in r-<lb/>process nucleosynthesis [12]. Including light elements in <lb/>a scenario of neutrino-driven wind reactions with light <lb/>nuclei can change the synthesis of heavier elements by <lb/>an order of magnitude. One important reaction chain <lb/>is α(t, γ) <lb/> 7  Li(n, γ) <lb/> 8  Li(α, n) <lb/> 11  B. The total cross-section at <lb/>9 MeV <lb/> 8  Li impact energy is about 400 mb but only a frac-<lb/>tion (≈ 20%) goes into the <lb/> 11  B ground state, while there <lb/>are up to 8 excited states involved. <lb/>In a recently published measurement [13], an ion cham-<lb/>ber filled with a 90/10 He/CO  2  gas mixture and 2 × 64 <lb/>flash ADCs for the readout enabled a three-dimensional <lb/>reconstruction of the tracks. The resulting energy spectra <lb/>allowed a rough separation of the <lb/> 11  B levels. In contrast, <lb/>TACTIC uses a GEM which, in principle, allows for much <lb/>better local resolution and therefore better tracking. The <lb/>layout of the TACTIC prototype will be designed to en-<lb/>close the <lb/> 11  B tracks for <lb/> 8  Li impact energies between 1.2 <lb/>and 9.0 MeV. <lb/>Another experiment is the measurement of the <lb/> 7  Be+p <lb/>elastic scattering cross-section at low energies. The an-<lb/>gular distributions give information on the phase shifts <lb/>for different angular momentum and spin combinations. <lb/>There are 16 phase shifts involved if only s, p, and d-waves <lb/> are taken into account, therefore a high angular resolu-<lb/>tion is required for this experiment. The contradicting re-<lb/>sults when compared with the mirror reaction <lb/> 7  Li + n [14, <lb/>15,16] could be resolved by an accurate angular distribu-<lb/>tion measurement using TACTIC. A better understanding <lb/>of the resonance structure will help in extrapolating the <lb/> 7  Be(p, γ) <lb/> 8  B cross-section to low energies —an important <lb/></body>

			<body> reaction for the high-energy neutrino production in the <lb/>Sun. <lb/>Another interesting application is the measurement of <lb/>nuclear reactions with three or more heavy-ion ejectiles. <lb/>The more complex phase space requires a large angu-<lb/>lar range with a good energy resolution to be measured <lb/>for two or more ejectiles in coincidence. This is hard to <lb/>achieve with passive detectors like silicon counters, while <lb/>in a TACTIC-like detector a high fraction of the ejectiles <lb/>can be tracked simultaneously. <lb/> 8 Conclusions <lb/> A cylindrical ionization chamber layout in combination <lb/>with GEM foils for time projection chamber-like track-<lb/>ing is a promising detector configuration for low-energy <lb/>nuclear reactions, in particular for measurements in in-<lb/>verse kinematics. The GEM is easy to handle and there <lb/>are fewer restrictions as opposed to gas cell pads. More-<lb/>over, it works very well with a He/CO  2  gas mixture which <lb/>opens the possibility of <lb/> 4  He and <lb/> 3  He induced RIB reac-<lb/>tions at low beam energies. <lb/>The suppression of the ionization electrons created by <lb/>the beam reduces the event rate by orders of magnitude <lb/>and makes TACTIC suitable for high-current RIB facili-<lb/>ties like ISAC/TRIUMF. The first measurement —the re-<lb/>action <lb/> 8  Li(α, n) <lb/> 11  B— will show the actual resolving power <lb/>of the TACTIC prototype and the maximum counting rate <lb/>that can be achieved. <lb/>The capability of simultaneous particle tracking qual-<lb/>ifies TACTIC for reactions with three or more heavy-ion <lb/>ejectiles. For this, however, a higher azimuthal segmenta-<lb/>tion of the anodes is required but it remains an interesting <lb/>application for the future. <lb/></body>

			<body> Abstract. The paper reports on the test of the newly developed RIKEN-ATOMKI CsI(Tl) array. It is <lb/>demonstrated that high-quality detectors with excellent light collection efficiency and narrow resolution dis-<lb/>tribution could be produced. The setup has been commissioned in the study of the reaction of <lb/> 22  O + CD2. <lb/>In the present paper, we summarize the results mainly on the (d, d <lb/>  ) channel. From the cross section for <lb/>the transition between the ground state and the first 2 <lb/> +  state, we could deduce the &quot; matter &quot; deformation <lb/>parameter to be βM = 0.23 ± 0.02 by distorted wave analysis. Comparing this data with previous measure-<lb/>ments it can be concluded that <lb/> 22  O isotope has moderate and similar neutron and proton deformations. <lb/> PACS. 25.70.Hi Transfer reactions – 27.30.+t 20 ≤ A ≤ 38 – 29.30.Kv X-and gamma-ray spectroscopy <lb/>– 29.30.Ep Charged-particle spectroscopy <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The existing and forthcoming radioactive beam facilities <lb/>open a wide range of possibilities to study exotic nuclei <lb/>and nuclear processes which play a crucial role in nucle-<lb/>osynthesis. To study direct nuclear reactions of astrophys-<lb/>ical and nuclear structure interest in inverse kinematics a <lb/>light ion spectrometer has been constructed in RIKEN to <lb/>be applied at the RIBF accelerator facility that is under <lb/>construction [1]. <lb/> 2 Characterization of the CsI(Tl) detectors <lb/> For charged particle detection, CsI(Tl) is an excellent ma-<lb/>terial of choice: it has high light yield; the wavelength of <lb/>the emitted light (∼ 550 nm) matches the sensitivity of sil-<lb/>icon photodiodes well; the decay time of the light emission <lb/> a  e-mail: elekes@atomki.hu <lb/> is a function of the particle type, enabling thereby parti-<lb/>cle identification. Since CsI(Tl) is only lightly hygroscopic, <lb/>light reflector wrapping need not to be humidity tight. The <lb/>only serious drawback of CsI(Tl) is the existence of a long <lb/>(∼ 8 μs) time constant light component. Despite the good <lb/>light yield, highly efficient and uniform collection of scin-<lb/>tillation light from all over the detector volume is manda-<lb/>tory from the point of view of good energy resolution and <lb/>particle identification alike [2]. This is especially impor-<lb/>tant for low energies where the signal/noise ratio is limited <lb/>by the inherent leakage current noise of the photodiode. <lb/>While the necessary thickness of the scintillator is deter-<lb/>mined by the highest energy of the particles to be stopped <lb/>in it, the lateral dimensions are dependent on factors like <lb/>the degree of granularity needed, the size of the photodi-<lb/>ode, etc. In our case the detectors are 55 mm thick, making <lb/>them able to stop charged particles up to 120 MeV/amu, <lb/>and their cross section is 16 × 16 mm <lb/> 2  except for the last <lb/>5 mm, where they are tapered to match the 10 × 10 mm <lb/></body>

			<body> The European Physical Journal A <lb/> Fig. 1. Distribution of the light collection efficiency and resolution of the detectors. <lb/> cross section photodiodes. The light collection efficiency <lb/>and its uniformity has been optimized through measure-<lb/>ments using numerous combinations of different surface <lb/>conditions and of various wrapping materials for the sides <lb/>and front face, and also by modeling with Monte Carlo <lb/>calculations [3]. The best solution for our purpose [4] is <lb/>front face polished, side surfaces specially depolished and <lb/>covered with two layers of 60 μm thick VM2000 mirror <lb/>film [5]. For the front face, this mirror film or thin alu-<lb/>minized Mylar foil can be used, depending on the type and <lb/>energy of the particles to be detected. Similar solutions in <lb/>the third generation of DIAMANT detector system [6] in <lb/>conjunction with Euroball, or in the GLAST space detec-<lb/>tor system [7], also justifies the choice of this mirror foil <lb/>as a promising new alternative in scintillation detection to <lb/>the presently overwhelmingly applied diffuse reflectors. <lb/>The quality of the applied technology can be assessed <lb/>from fig. 1, which summarizes the performance test re-<lb/>sults obtained with 5.5 MeV alpha particles for all the <lb/>312 detector units completed, in the form of amplitude <lb/>and resolution distribution graphs. The light collection <lb/>is so well reproducible that the amplitude distribution <lb/>is only slightly wider (FWHM = 3.2%), than the width <lb/>of an individual spectral peak (2.55%). This means, that <lb/>practically no gain matching in the array is necessary. <lb/>During this test all detectors were covered with a thin <lb/>Aluminized Mylar front reflector. By replacing it with a <lb/>VM2000 film, which poses no problem in the detection <lb/>of high-energy light particles, the amplitudes can be in-<lb/>creased by ≈ 20%, significantly improving thereby the en-<lb/>ergy resolution. The average value of the low-energy back-<lb/>ground continuum for 5.5 MeV alphas, not shown in the <lb/>figure, is less than 3%. It is worth mentioning that despite <lb/>of the much larger scintillator crystals (16 × 16 × 55 mm <lb/> 3 <lb/> vs. 14.5 × 14.5 × 3 mm <lb/> 3  ) of this system the energy reso-<lb/>lution values are only slightly lower (2.5% vs. 2.1%) than <lb/>that of the DIAMANT system [6]. Please note, that be-<lb/>sides charged particles, CsI(Tl) is a sensitive and high-<lb/>performance gamma ray detector. For gammas, the light <lb/>yield is ≈ 30 photon/keV with &lt; 0.3% nonuniformity <lb/>along the crystal length, whereas the energy resolution <lb/>for 511 keV is &lt; 10%. <lb/> Z.

The telescope consisted of four <lb/>layers with thicknesses of 0.5, 0.5, 2 and 2 mm. The first <lb/>two layers were made of stripped detectors measuring the <lb/> x and y positions of the fragments. On the basis of ΔE-E <lb/> information, separation was carried out among the differ-<lb/>ent oxygen isotopes which is demonstrated in fig. 3 where <lb/>the linearized mass spectrum of oxygen nuclei is shown <lb/>for one segment of the telescope. The protons emitted <lb/>backward in the reaction were detected by 156 CsI(Tl) <lb/></body>

The solid line is the final fit including the <lb/>spectrum curve from GEANT4 simulation and an additional <lb/>smooth polynomial background plotted as a separate dotted <lb/>line. <lb/> scintillator crystals read out by photodiodes. The parti-<lb/>cle identification quality is presented in fig. 4 where the <lb/>gamma rays and protons are well separated from each <lb/>other down to 1–2 MeV energy of protons. 80 NaI(Tl) <lb/>scintillator detectors also surrounded the target to detect <lb/>de-exciting γ-rays emitted by the inelastically scattered <lb/>nuclei. The intrinsic energy resolution of the array was <lb/>10% (FWHM) for a 662 keV γ-ray energy. The neutrons <lb/>coming from the produced excited <lb/> 23  O nuclei were de-<lb/>tected by a neutron wall consisting of four layers of plastic <lb/>scintillators placed at 2.5 m downstream of the target. <lb/> 4 Results and discussion <lb/> In fig. 5 the Doppler-corrected γ-ray spectra for <lb/> 22  O <lb/>nucleus is presented, which is produced by putting <lb/>an additional gate on the time spectra of the NaI(Tl) <lb/>detectors selecting the prompt events and subtracting <lb/>the random coincidences. By fitting the spectrum with a <lb/>Gaussian function and smooth exponential background, <lb/>first, the position of the single peak was determined at <lb/>3185(15) keV. The quoted uncertainty of the peak position <lb/>is the square root of the sum of the squared uncertainties <lb/>including two main errors namely the statistical one and <lb/>the one due to Doppler correction. The above energy for <lb/> 22  O is in a good agreement with the value 3199(8) keV <lb/>determined earlier [9]. After the peak position has been <lb/>determined it was fed into the detector simulation soft-<lb/>ware GEANT4 [10] and the resultant response curve plus <lb/>a smooth polynomial background was used to analyze the <lb/>experimental spectrum and determine the cross section <lb/>for <lb/> 22  O + <lb/> 2  H reaction to be σ(0 <lb/> + <lb/>1  → 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  ) = 19 ± 3 mb. <lb/>From a distorted-wave analysis, we derived the &quot; matter &quot; <lb/>deformation length (δ  M  ). In the calculation, the stan-<lb/>dard collective form factors were applied and the param-<lb/>eter set in [11] was employed for the optical potential. <lb/>The &quot; matter &quot; deformation length deduced in this way is <lb/> δ  M  = 0.77±0.07 fm which corresponds to a moderate mass <lb/>deformation of β  M  = 0.23 ± 0.02. We can compare this re-<lb/>sult with the data from <lb/> 22  O + <lb/> 197  Au reaction [12] where <lb/>the sensitivity of the probe for proton and neutron distri-<lb/>butions is different from that of our case. In the cited work, <lb/>the proton deformation (β  p  ) was derived to be between 0.2 <lb/>and 0.24. This means that the neutron deformation of <lb/> 22  O <lb/>is very close to that of the proton one taking into account <lb/>the mass deformation determined in the present study. <lb/>This result is in contrast with the expectations that the <lb/>increasing neutron number may lead to a stronger neu-<lb/>tron decoupling. In reality, the M  n  /M  p  ∼ β  n  /β  p  ratios <lb/>are 2, 3 and 1 for <lb/> 18  O, <lb/> 20  O and <lb/> 22  O, respectively. The in-<lb/>creasing trend is stopped by the N = 14 subshell closure, <lb/>which was indicated already by the high energy of the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/> state as well as by the small value of the B(E2; 0 <lb/> + <lb/>1  → 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  ). <lb/>The subshell closure makes both the proton and neutron <lb/>distributions nearly spherical in <lb/> 22  O. <lb/></body>

			<body> Abstract. In the first half of the paper, the nuclear astrophysics activities in Japan, especially in ex-<lb/>perimental studies are briefly overviewed. A variety of beams have been developed and used for nuclear <lb/>astrophysics experiments in Japan. The activities include the RI beam facilities at low energies by the <lb/>in-flight method at the Center for Nuclear Study (CNS), University of Tokyo and by the ISOL-based <lb/>method at the JAERI tandem facility, and the RI beam facility at intermediate energies at RIKEN. Other <lb/>activities include a study of the <lb/> 12  C(α, γ) <lb/> 16  O reaction exclusively at the tandem accelerator at the Kyushu <lb/>University, and studies at the neutron facility at Tokyo Institute of Technology and at the photon facility <lb/>at AIST (Sanso-ken). Research opportunities in the future at RIBF, J-PARC, and SPRING8 are also <lb/>discussed. A discussion on the research activities at CNS has been specifically extended in the latter half, <lb/>including various possibilities in collaboration at the RI beam factory at RIKEN. <lb/> PACS. 25.70.Ef Resonances – 25.60.-t Reactions induced by unstable nuclei – 26.30.+k Nucleosynthesis <lb/>in novae, supernovae and other explosive environments – 29.25.Rm Sources of radioactive nuclei <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> The nuclear astrophysics activity in Japan is partially <lb/>stimulated by the high activities in astronomy in Japan. <lb/>The Kamiokande detector successfully observed the super-<lb/>nova neutrinos in 1987 for the first time, and the large-<lb/>scale, high-resolution optical telescope SUBARU has been <lb/>operational since 1997 in Hawaii. The successful operation <lb/>of X-ray observatories in Japan is another element. Re-<lb/>cently, the radio-observatory activities at Nobeyama have <lb/>been decided to extend to the ALMA project, that is the <lb/>next generation of the radio observatories, based on the <lb/>US-Japan-Europe collaboration. Of course, the nuclear as-<lb/>trophysics activity inversely has stimulated, for instance, <lb/> a  e-mail: kubono@cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp <lb/> astronomical observations of r-process elements as well as <lb/>the s-process elements in very metal-poor stars, and also <lb/>observations of isotopic ratios rather than elements. For <lb/>instance, a recent SUBARU observation has succeeded in <lb/>determining the isotopic ratios for the element Eu. <lb/>Experimental efforts in nuclear astrophysics have been <lb/>expanded very rapidly in the last two decades since the <lb/>introduction of RI beams in nuclear physics. One of the <lb/>major reasons is that the nuclear reactions involved in <lb/>explosive phenomena in the universe can be directly in-<lb/>vestigated with RI beams at very low energies. Along the <lb/>development of nuclear astrophysics several useful meth-<lb/>ods have been invented for the field. These include indirect <lb/>methods such as the Coulomb dissociation method, the <lb/>asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) method, and <lb/>so on. These developments are summarized in ref. [1].

The research ac-<lb/>tivity of nuclear astrophysics is now widely accepted as <lb/>an important subfield of nuclear physics. It can be easily <lb/>understood by looking at session names in most large con-<lb/>ferences, and also at research propagandas in proposals for <lb/>large-scale facilities. One never misses subjects related to <lb/>nuclear astrophysics. <lb/>As is well known, there are two ways for RI beam pro-<lb/>duction. In-flight RI beam separation is the most popu-<lb/>lar way adopted and realized, but ISOL-based method is <lb/>more powerful in a sense for nuclear astrophysics. These <lb/>two type facilities are available in Japan. The former <lb/>method has been adopted at RIKEN at intermediate en-<lb/>ergies, and at the Center for Nuclear Study (CNS), Uni-<lb/>versity of Tokyo at low energies, whereas the latter one <lb/>is adopted at the KEK-JAERI collaboration. A neutron <lb/>source is available at the pelletron facility at the Tokyo <lb/>Institute of Technology. Photon beams, available at AIST <lb/>(Sanso-ken), were introduced for nuclear astrophysics ex-<lb/>periments. On the other hand, a pure, high intensity <lb/> 12  C <lb/>beam is also realized at low energies at the Tandem facility <lb/>of the Kyushu University. <lb/>Table 1 summarizes the major beam facilities now <lb/>available for nuclear astrophysics in Japan. Details will be <lb/>described for each facility in sect. 2. There are some other <lb/>facilities relevant to nuclear astrophysics. Nuclear reaction <lb/>mechanisms at very low energies have been investigated at <lb/>Tohoku University, and some stellar reactions are under <lb/>investigation at the Research Center of Nuclear Physics, <lb/>Osaka University by an indirect method. We specifically <lb/>discuss the detail of the low-energy in-flight RI beam sepa-<lb/>rator CRIB [9] at CNS in sect. 3, and the experimental re-<lb/>sults in sects. 4 and 5. A short summary is given in sect. 6. <lb/> 2 Experimental facilities in japan <lb/> There are two-type RI beam facilities known, and both <lb/>of them are available in Japan, as mentioned above. In-<lb/>flight type RI beam separators include RIPS at RIKEN <lb/>at intermediate energies and CRIB at CNS. In-flight sep-<lb/>aration mostly uses inverse kinematics to obtain the kine-<lb/>matical focusing effect. Unstable nuclei can be produced <lb/>with heavy-ion induced reactions, separated in-flight and <lb/>focused at the double-achromatic focal plane. A detail of <lb/>RIPS will be explained in the contribution by Togano to <lb/>this symposium. The most typical activities for nuclear <lb/>astrophysics with RIPS are the investigation of stellar <lb/>reactions using the Coulomb dissociation method. The <lb/>low-energy separator CRIB will be discussed in detail <lb/>in the next section. The RI Beam Factory (RIBF) at <lb/>RIKEN, which is under construction, will begin deliver-<lb/>ing RI beams in 2006 or 2007, which will enable us to <lb/>investigate the pathway of the r-process for the cosmo-<lb/>chronology, first generation stars, and the supernova <lb/>mechanism. The detail of the RIBF project may be found <lb/>at http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/index-e.html. <lb/> The ISOL-based facility, called TRIAC, very recently <lb/>has been established at the Tandem laboratory in JAERI, <lb/>Tokai by a collaboration of JAERI and KEK. Most part <lb/>was transferred from the E-arena of the old INS (Institute <lb/>for Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo). They are going <lb/>to place their emphasis on acceleration of fission products <lb/>for nuclear physics as well as for nuclear astrophysics. The <lb/>facility may be operational for routine use from the fall of <lb/>2005. They also have a plan to increase the RI beam ener-<lb/>gies by the existing super-conducting Linac up to 8 MeV/u <lb/>for ions of q/A ≥ 1/4. A detailed introduction to the fa-<lb/>cility can be found at http://triac.kek.jp/en/. <lb/> Neutron capture reactions play a crucial role specifi-<lb/>cally for heavy element synthesis. The neutron facility at <lb/>the Tokyo Institute of Technology has been running for <lb/>more than ten years for nuclear astrophysics. The group <lb/>headed by Nagai introduced large-volume NaI crystals to <lb/>measure directly the capture-gamma rays, which made the <lb/>measurements more reliable than the activation method. <lb/>They have found an important contribution of p-wave un-<lb/>der a certain condition even at very low energies, indicat-<lb/>ing breakdown of the 1/v rule. A proposal of an extensive <lb/>neutron facility plan for nuclear astrophysics has been ap-<lb/>proved in the J-PARC project, the large hadron project <lb/>by the joint venture of KEK and JAERI, although the <lb/>proposal is not funded yet. <lb/>Another interesting beam for nuclear astrophysics is <lb/>the real photon beam, which can be obtained by backscat-<lb/>tering of the laser beam from stored electron beams. A <lb/>beautiful experiment was demonstrated by Utsunomiya, <lb/>which can be explained in detail in this volume of the pro-<lb/>ceedings. A new-generation photon beam facility is under <lb/>preparation at Spring8 in Harima, Japan. <lb/>The last facility is the Tandem accelerator facility at <lb/>Kyushu University. They have constructed an extensive <lb/>recoil separator exclusively for the measurement of the <lb/>stellar <lb/> 12  C(α, γ) <lb/> 16  O reaction at the He burning tempera-<lb/>ture region. They have succeeded to modify the Tandem <lb/></body>

Cur-<lb/>rently, they are fighting to attain the beam suppression <lb/>factor of 10 <lb/> −19  by improving the whole system by one <lb/>order of magnitude. <lb/>As we overviewed above, we have a variety of oppor-<lb/>tunities for experimental nuclear astrophysics in Japan as <lb/>well as great possibilities in the years to come. <lb/> 3 The CRIB project at CNS <lb/> The CNS shut down their own cyclotron in 2000, and <lb/>moved to the RIKEN campus, and immediately initiated <lb/>a joint venture with RIKEN at the RIKEN Accelerator <lb/>Research Facility (RARF). CRIB [10] is one of the major <lb/>facilities that CNS introduced to RARF. In order to max-<lb/>imize the capability, we set a CNS-RIKEN joint project, <lb/>AVF-Up Grade Project, under which we had decided to <lb/>establish an extensive low-energy RI beam separator. Fig-<lb/>ure 1 displays the plane view of CRIB which consists of <lb/>a double-achromatic magnetic section and a Wien Filter <lb/>section. The configuration is F0-QMDQ-F1-DMQ-F2-QQ-<lb/>WF-QQ-F3, where Fi is the i-th focal plane of the optics, <lb/>D a dipole magnet, Q a quadrupole magnet, and M a mul-<lb/>tipole magnet. One may use a degrader at F1, which is a <lb/>momentum dispersive focal plane, for a better separation <lb/>of the RI beam of interest. <lb/>The Wien filter section gives a capability of better <lb/>particle separation and also provides some interesting fea-<lb/>tures for other studies. The velocity separation section has <lb/>1.5 m-long electric parallel plates that have the maximum <lb/>voltages of ±200 kV for a gap of 8 cm, giving 50 kV/cm. <lb/>The maximum velocity dispersion designed was about <lb/>0.8 cm/%. The separation capability was verified with an <lb/> 14  O beam produced from the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 14  N, <lb/> 14  O) reaction at F0. <lb/>It gave almost 100% purity at F3. Another favorable fea-<lb/>ture of the RI beam from the filter is the beam quality. <lb/>Under some condition, one may need only the Wien filter <lb/>without the degrader, to obtain a small beam spot since <lb/>the major factor for the RI beam size is due to the strag-<lb/>gling at the degrader. <lb/>For example, an <lb/> 14  O beam of 1.6 × 10 <lb/> 6  pps was ob-<lb/>tained from the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 14  N, <lb/> 14  O) reaction with a moderate <lb/>beam intensity of 200 pnA of the primary beam at F0. We <lb/>have succeeded to eliminate most contamination by the <lb/>Wien filter. The RI beam size at F3 is still as large as <lb/>7 × 7 mm <lb/> 2  without degrader. Since this can be improved <lb/>by correcting for the higher order aberration of the beam <lb/>optics, a new sextupole magnet was installed. This work is <lb/>in progress. The RI beam intensities (table 2) are limited <lb/></body>

The asterisk indicates a transition to the <lb/>0.495 MeV first excited state in <lb/> 17  F. <lb/> by two factors at this moment, the primary beam inten-<lb/>sities and the production target. An intensive program is <lb/>under way for the first part by installing the Hyper ECR <lb/>source, and by upgrading many parts of the AVF cyclotron <lb/>for the acceleration efficiency. This includes successful in-<lb/>stallation of a flat-top acceleration mode, a new deflector, <lb/>new DC power supplies, etc. The accelerator energy factor <lb/>K is now about 80, which was about 45 in practice before. <lb/>As for the second part, a cooled gas target system is being <lb/>developed that has a higher target density and can stand <lb/>high beam currents. These efforts are in progress so that <lb/>in the near future we may begin to study the stellar (p, γ) <lb/> reaction directly with CRIB. This project should be a nice <lb/>demonstration that a small accelerator facility can make <lb/>a great contribution for RI beam physics. <lb/> 4 The direct measurement of the <lb/> 14 O(α, p) <lb/> 17 F reaction <lb/> A series of reaction studies with low-energy RI beams has <lb/>been undertaken at CRIB, specifically, for the onset and <lb/>the early stage of the explosive hydrogen burning (rp) pro-<lb/>cess. <lb/>The high-temperature (high-T ) rp-process may typi-<lb/>cally take place in an X-ray burst, which is considered to <lb/>be an event on the surface of a neutron star with accretion <lb/>of hydrogen from the companion star in the main sequence <lb/>phase. Here, one of the most critical stellar reactions is <lb/> 14  O(α, p) <lb/> 17  F for the ignition of the high-T rp-process. <lb/>There are many experiments performed by indirect meth-<lb/>ods [11,12] for the problem, but not by the direct method <lb/>with an <lb/> 14  O beam. Two experiments were made previ-<lb/>ously using the time-reverse reaction <lb/> 17  F(p, α) <lb/> 14  O. Only <lb/>some transitions through resonances above E  cm  = 3 MeV <lb/>in <lb/> 18  Ne were reported [13,14]. Note that the most critical <lb/>energy region is around E  cm  = 1–2 MeV for the present <lb/>problem. This reaction has been successfully investigated <lb/>for the first time using a high intensity <lb/> 14  O beam from <lb/>CRIB. <lb/>A low-energy <lb/> 14  O beam was produced by the <lb/> 1  H( <lb/> 14  N, <lb/> 14  O) reaction at 8.4 MeV/u, and separated. The <lb/>intensity and the purity of the beam was 1.6 × 10 <lb/> 6  pps and <lb/>85%, respectively, at F2. The momentum spread of the <lb/>beam was defined to 1% by setting an aperture at F1, the <lb/>momentum dispersive focal plane. The secondary target <lb/>of He was cooled down to about 30 K, so that the tar-<lb/>get length was shortened roughly by a factor of 10, which <lb/>made the present experiment possible. This is described <lb/>in detail in ref. [15]. <lb/>For the measurement of the <lb/> 14  O(α, p) <lb/> 17  F cross section, <lb/>we applied the thick-target method [1], which has been de-<lb/>veloped in the last decade for low-energy RIB experiments <lb/>and applied for proton elastic scattering experiments. This <lb/>method was successfully used in the present case. Fig-<lb/>ure 2 displays a proton spectrum measured at 0 <lb/> •  with a <lb/></body>

Possible states are <lb/>indicated by the excitation energies in <lb/> 24  Al. <lb/> silicon counter telescope. Several peaks are clearly seen <lb/>that correspond to the (α, p) reaction mostly leading to <lb/>the ground state in <lb/> 17  F. The transitions through the 6.15 <lb/>and 6.29 MeV states in <lb/> 18  Ne were seen for the first time. <lb/>These transitions were considered to be the main contribu-<lb/>tions to the stellar reactions under the X-ray burst con-<lb/>dition [11]. The cross sections are roughly the same as <lb/>predicted in ref. [11], thus confirming the primary impor-<lb/>tance of the two contributions. The transitions through <lb/>the states at 7–8 MeV are also clearly observed. The peak <lb/>around 6.5 MeV is considered to be the transition through <lb/>the state at 7.1 MeV in <lb/> 18  Ne decaying to the first excited <lb/>state at 0.495 MeV in <lb/> 17  F. Since there is no state of large <lb/>proton width in the <lb/> 17  F+p scattering [14] and the states in <lb/>this energy region in <lb/> 18  Ne cannot have a large α width as <lb/>it is so close to the α threshold, the peak around 6.5 MeV <lb/>cannot be explained by a state in <lb/> 18  Ne. This implies that <lb/>the transition through the 7.1 MeV state in <lb/> 18  Ne increases <lb/>the reaction rate roughly by 50%. Note that the reaction <lb/>study with the time-reverse reaction cannot access this <lb/>process. <lb/> 5 Search for proton resonances relevant to <lb/>the early stage of the rp-process <lb/> The mechanism of the early stage of the rp-process is of <lb/>great interest. Previously, we studied by indirect methods <lb/>the excited states near and above the proton threshold in <lb/>the proton-rich nuclei, relevant to the early stage of the rp-<lb/>process [16], where many new states were identified. How-<lb/>ever, the reaction rates are not determined yet because <lb/>the resonance properties are not known. Thus, we have <lb/>started to investigate the properties of these proton reso-<lb/>nances by the direct method. So far, we studied the proton <lb/>resonant scattering of <lb/> 21  Na+p, <lb/> 22  Mg+p, <lb/> 23  Mg+p, <lb/> 25  Al+p <lb/>and <lb/> 26  Si+p as well as <lb/> 24  Mg+p for testing the thick tar-<lb/>get method [1] with the present experimental setup. The <lb/>present data of <lb/> 24  Mg+p are very well reproduced by the <lb/> R-matrix calculation [17] with known resonance param-<lb/>eters, confirming the validity of the method. Preliminary <lb/>results on <lb/> 25  Al+p and <lb/> 26  Si+p are presented elsewhere [18]. <lb/>Figure 3 displays the proton excitation functions of <lb/> 23  Mg+p. This is the first experiment to investigate <lb/> 24  Al <lb/>by proton resonance scattering. No resonance parameters <lb/>were known before for the states in <lb/> 24  Al [19]. We can see <lb/>clearly two resonances at 3.88 and 4.06 MeV, and they are <lb/>fitted well by s-wave resonances and are in agreement with <lb/>previously known states at 3.885 and 4.059 MeV [19]. We <lb/>can also see three resonances that probably correspond to <lb/>the 1 <lb/> +  states known by the beta decay study of <lb/> 24  Si [20]. <lb/>Detailed analysis is in progress. <lb/> 6 Summary <lb/> Experimental facilities for nuclear astrophysics in Japan <lb/>are briefly overviewed together with their research activ-<lb/>ities. Most of the interesting beams are available and the <lb/>future scope is also bright for this field. These include <lb/>high-energy RI beams of very short-lived, very neutron-<lb/>rich nuclei at RIKEN, extensive photon beams at Spring8, <lb/>and high-intensity neutron beams at J-PARC. <lb/>In contrast to these grand scale facilities, small ma-<lb/>chine facilities also can make great contributions to nu-<lb/>clear astrophysics. Our extensive low-energy RI beam fa-<lb/>cility, CRIB, demonstrates such feasibility. We may inves-<lb/>tigate stellar reactions of the rp-process very efficiently <lb/>at CRIB. We have shown that an in-flight RI beam pro-<lb/>duction method at low energies is very useful, and has <lb/></body>

Sujkowski <lb/> The Andrzej Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies, 05-400 Otwock -´ <lb/>Swierk, Poland <lb/>Received: 13 July 2005 / <lb/>Published online: 23 March 2006 – c <lb/> Socieà Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2006 <lb/> Abstract. Large clouds of totally ionised helium and hydrogen might exist in the intergalactic space, <lb/>invisible for the usual optical observations. These clouds, bombarded with medium energy electrons, should <lb/>generate photon radiation in the X-ray region. The radiation is associated with the Radiative Electron <lb/>Capture, REC, by He <lb/> ++  ions and should be observable with space born detectors. The photon spectra <lb/>calculated for a range of temperatures of the electron spectra as well as several column densities of the <lb/>plasma clouds are discussed. <lb/> PACS. 25.40.Lw Radiative capture – 98.62.Ra Intergalactic matter; quasar absorption and emission-line <lb/>systems; Lyman forest <lb/> 1 Introduction <lb/> One of the most intriguing questions of to-day astro-<lb/>physics is the mass balance of the Universe. The observed <lb/>baryonic mass is only about 4 ± 1% of the total mass. <lb/>The nature of the &quot; cold dark matter &quot; [(29 ± 4)%] and <lb/>of the &quot; dark energy &quot; [(67 ± 6)%], i.e. of the unobserved <lb/>missing mass is largely unknown [1]. Various hypotheses <lb/>are being put forward, such as, e.g., the SUSY particles <lb/>or the disappearance of massive particles in extra dimen-<lb/>sions [2]. <lb/>Fascinating as this discussion is, it requires precise <lb/>book-keeping of the known, ordinary baryonic matter <lb/>spread throughout the Universe. A possible contribution <lb/>to this baryonic component, which has so far been largely <lb/>neglected, may be due to the diffuse clouds of completely <lb/>ionized hydrogen and helium in the intergalactic medium, <lb/>IGM. This matter, presumably of primordial origin, es-<lb/>capes observation by the usual optical methods. <lb/>Clouds of neutral hydrogen have been detected in the <lb/>earth-bound observatories as the so-called &quot; Lyman forest &quot; <lb/>in the quasar&apos;s absorption spectra in a large range of z. <lb/> The <lb/> 2  H/ <lb/> 1  H &gt; 4 × 10 <lb/> −5  isotope ratios have been deter-<lb/>mined. The column densities of about 5 × 10 <lb/> 17  cm <lb/> −2  been <lb/>deduced for the neutral <lb/> 1  H [3]. Much larger quantities of <lb/>the hydrogen plasma are presumably associated with these <lb/>clouds. <lb/>The first evidence of the existence of the helium plasma <lb/>clouds stems from the observation of the red shifted 304Å <lb/>absorption line in the light of the quasar Q0302-003 [4,5, <lb/>6]. This line is characteristic for absorption by singly ion-<lb/>ized helium, He <lb/> +  . No lines expected for the neutral He <lb/> a  e-mail: danka@ipj.gov.pl <lb/> (λ  0  = 584Å) have been seen. These facts can be consid-<lb/>ered as an indirect evidence of the existence of substan-<lb/>tial amounts of completely ionized hydrogen and helium <lb/>plasma scattered in the IGM. The total mass of the bary-<lb/>onic matter distributed there may be far from insignifi-<lb/>cant. <lb/>Besides contributing to the total mass of the baryonic <lb/>matter the clouds of the primordial hydrogen and helium <lb/>in the IGM carry precious information relevant for the <lb/>theories of Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and for the <lb/>cosmic chemical evolution. Information of this kind might <lb/>be particularly valuable in the light of the recent high-<lb/>precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Back-<lb/>ground —CMB [7]. <lb/>The principle of the observation is illustrated in fig. 1. <lb/>The He <lb/> +  clouds situated between a quasar and the ob-<lb/>server display various red shifts. The corresponding z-<lb/> values are a measure of the distances. To quote [4] &quot; the <lb/>intergalactic space appears to be peppered with tenuous <lb/>clouds of possibly primordial gas that have not yet con-<lb/>densed into galaxies &quot; . <lb/>The observation of the He <lb/> +  line, combined with the <lb/>non-observation of the neutral He lines, are not sufficient <lb/>to determine the total amount of gas or gas-plasma in <lb/>the clouds. They give some model dependent limits. To <lb/>quote [4] further, they show &quot; the tip of the iceberg in <lb/>terms of the total baryonic mass present &quot; . It is thus obvi-<lb/>ous that any independent observable shedding light on the <lb/>hidden part of this mass would be of considerable value. <lb/>One such observable could be the photon spectrum in the <lb/>X-ray region due to the radiative capture of fast electrons <lb/>by the He <lb/> ++  ions. The present work describes the prin-<lb/>ciple of such observation. The experiment verifying the <lb/></body>

The absorption lines are <lb/>red-shifted depending on the distance of the clouds, giving rise <lb/>to the &quot; Lyman-α forest &quot; . <lb/> theoretical cross-sections for the radiative capture process <lb/>in the difficult to reach relativistic region is described sep-<lb/>arately [8]. <lb/> 2 Expected photon spectra due to Radiative <lb/>Electron Capture in the plasma clouds <lb/> A general description of the Radiative Electron Capture <lb/>process for fast relativistic electrons can be found, e.g., <lb/> in [9] (see also [10,11,12]). <lb/>The process corresponds to the time reversed photo-<lb/>electric effect for atoms in partly ionized states: <lb/> Z <lb/> q <lb/> +  + ¯ hν =⇒ Z <lb/> (q+1) <lb/> +  + e <lb/> −  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where Z is the atomic number and q is the charge of the <lb/>ion. <lb/>In the case of He <lb/> ++  ions the inverse effect occurs for <lb/>singly ionized helium, He <lb/> +  . The cross-section for the REC <lb/>effect, σ  REC  , depends strongly on the atomic number of <lb/>the capturing ion Z as well as on the velocity of the elec-<lb/>trons, v  e  . <lb/>Crudely <lb/> σ  REC  ∼ <lb/> Z <lb/> 4.5 <lb/> v  5  . <lb/> (2) <lb/>The plasma clouds in the IGM are subject to continu-<lb/>ous bombardment by fluxes of photons and fast electrons. <lb/> Fig. 2.

Due to the REC effect they convert the <lb/>electron spectra to photon spectra of practically the same <lb/>energy, cross-section weighted at each energy value: <lb/> Y  γ  (E  γ  ) = Y  e  (E  e  ) <lb/> 1 − e <lb/> −NσREC <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where Eγ = E  e  , Y  e  (E  e  ) is the number of electrons of <lb/>energy E  e  and N is the column number density of the <lb/>cloud. The column number density is defined as the total <lb/>number of particles per cm <lb/> 2  in the column of the length <lb/>equal the size of the cloud at a given section. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the photon spectra calculated for sev-<lb/>eral temperatures and column densities. The background <lb/>spectra of electrons, indicated schematically in fig. 2, are <lb/>taken from the BATSE catalogue [13]. The REC spectra <lb/>are calculated under the assumption of a spherical plasma <lb/>cloud bombarded isotropically from all directions. This av-<lb/>erages out the otherwise strongly anisotropic REC emis-<lb/>sion. <lb/>Only some educated guesses can be made about the <lb/> N (plasma) values for He <lb/> ++  and H <lb/> +  . The range of the <lb/> D. Chmielewska and Z. Sujkowski: Radiative electron capture —A tool to detect He <lb/> ++  in space <lb/>335 <lb/> values used in fig. 2 reflects in an exaggerated way the <lb/>uncertainties in these estimates. <lb/>The relative contribution of H <lb/> ++  and H <lb/> +  to the REC <lb/>spectra can be obtained from the estimate <lb/>[N (He) + N (He <lb/> +  ) + N (He <lb/> ++  )] ≈ 0.08[N (H) + N (H <lb/> +  )] <lb/>and from the approximate relationship σ  REC  (He) ≈ <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4.5  σ  REC  (H) for any given E  e  (see formula (2)). <lb/>Hence helium and hydrogen contribute about 2/3 and <lb/>1/3 to the total photon spectrum, respectively. <lb/> 3 Summary and conclusions <lb/> It is shown that helium + hydrogen plasma clouds in the <lb/>IGM can act as effective converters of electron-to-photon <lb/>spectra in the observationally attractive energy range of a <lb/>few to a few hundred keV. <lb/>This offers a possibility of obtaining an observa-<lb/>tional, quantitative information on the completely ionized <lb/>hydrogen and helium plasma clouds in the Inter-Galactic <lb/>Medium. <lb/></body>

Pushed by the public interest, nuclear astro-<lb/>physics is called to provide answers to various outstanding <lb/>questions. In order to meet these inquiries, astrophysical <lb/>research is a growing field [1]. Within this astrophysical <lb/>context, nuclear-data activities are one basic instrument <lb/>to help to answer such questions [2,3]. Nuclear data are <lb/>needed for a better understanding of spectacular events <lb/>such as the Big-Bang, star evolution and supernova (SN) <lb/>explosions, but also to gain insight into the formation <lb/>of our solar system. Nucleosynthesis gives us one of the <lb/>very important fingerprints of nature, the elemental abun-<lb/>dances. In order to understand this signature, the physics <lb/>of nuclear reactions have to be well understood. Network <lb/>calculations of element production in various scenarios <lb/>have shown a great progress in the last years and they <lb/>allow for reproducing a lot of the abundance distribution <lb/>of the elements. However, we are still at a very early stage <lb/>of understanding the physics leading to the well-known <lb/>isotopic pattern of our Solar System. The success of as-<lb/>trophysical models depends strongly on the accuracy of <lb/>nuclear data. These ingredients have to be provided from <lb/>experimental investigations. One essential key to this re-<lb/>quest is the precise knowledge of reaction and production <lb/> a  e-mail: anton.wallner@univie.ac.at <lb/> cross-sections. Such experimental input helps to verify nu-<lb/>clear model calculations and gives us a deeper understand-<lb/>ing of the nuclear forces responsible for the nuclear inter-<lb/>actions. This huge nuclear-data need pushes the activi-<lb/>ties of experimental facilities to investigate astrophysical <lb/>questionnaires. Here we want to discuss the technique of <lb/>accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) as a valuable tool <lb/>for probing nucleosynthesis. In the following sections the <lb/>potential of AMS for quantifying long-lived radionuclides <lb/>will be highlighted. <lb/> 2 Accelerator mass spectrometry at the <lb/>Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator <lb/>facility <lb/> Well-established data on production-rates of long-lived ra-<lb/>dionuclides are important for the various nucleosynthesis <lb/>processes and they are highly desired.

Especially long-<lb/>lived radionuclides have often been inaccessible to decay <lb/>counting techniques, e.g. because of low activity or an un-<lb/>favorable decay scheme. In such cases the technique of <lb/>AMS may provide valuable contributions to our under-<lb/>standing of celestial evolution and nucleosynthesis. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1. Schematic layout of the VERA facility: Stable ions are measured with Faraday cups positioned after the injection <lb/>magnet (low-energy section, negative ions) and after the analyzing magnet (high-energy section, positive ions). The rare isotope <lb/>count-rates are obtained using energy-sensitive particle detectors. The detection system of the heavy-ion beamline (which is <lb/>also used for <lb/> 41  Ca-detection) consists of the time-of-flight (TOF) detectors and an energy (E) detector. <lb/> Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) represents an <lb/>analytical method for the detection of various nuclides <lb/>through direct atom-counting. This mass spectromet-<lb/>ric technique offers the potential for quantifying isotope <lb/>abundances down to levels of 10 <lb/> −15  and below. AMS is <lb/>applied for the detection of radionuclides with half-lives <lb/>between a few years and up to hundred million years. In <lb/>combination with very low sample masses needed, AMS <lb/>offers a tremendously higher sensitivity compared to the <lb/>decay counting method, which is a consequence of the long <lb/>half-life of those radionuclides. <lb/>In the following the method of AMS is summarized <lb/>with focus on a typical AMS facility as represented by <lb/>the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA). <lb/>VERA is based on a 3-MV pelletron tandem. It repre-<lb/>sents a state-of-the-art AMS facility (fig. 1), which pro-<lb/>vides the ability for quantifying nuclides over the whole <lb/>mass range [4,5,6]. Some of the measured radioisotopes <lb/>are, e.g., <lb/> 10  Be, <lb/> 14  C, <lb/> 26  Al, <lb/> 36  Cl, <lb/> 41  Ca, <lb/> 129  I, <lb/> 182  Hf, <lb/> 236  U and <lb/> 244  Pu. Since it offers highest sensitivity, AMS at VERA is <lb/>predestinated for the measurement of minute concentra-<lb/>tions of such isotopes. At VERA, AMS is used for quan-<lb/>tifying long-lived radionuclides within a wide range of ap-<lb/>plications —from archaeology via climate research to as-<lb/>trophysics (for details see, e.g., [7,8]). <lb/>AMS uses negative ion sputter sources: Solid sample <lb/>material is inserted into an ion source. At VERA a sample-<lb/>wheel containing positions for 40 samples can be loaded <lb/>into the ion source. The sample material is sputtered us-<lb/>ing a Cs beam focused onto the sample. In most cases the <lb/>sample material has to be converted for the AMS measure-<lb/>ment into a suitable chemical form. AMS itself represents <lb/>a &quot; sample-destructive &quot; technique. Typical samples masses <lb/>are a few mg of material. The range of isotope ratios mea-<lb/>sured with AMS is of the order of 10 <lb/> −10  to 10 <lb/> −15  . It is also <lb/>this dynamic range, which makes AMS a flexible and at-<lb/>tractive technique. The sensitivity of AMS is exemplified <lb/>using the following typical values: Assume 10 mg sample <lb/>material (e.g., Ca) is available for a measurement (which <lb/>will give several sputter targets for the AMS measure-<lb/>ment). If we combine a typical isotope ratio of 10 <lb/> −12  (or <lb/>10 <lb/> −14  ) and the sample mass, we obtain a total number of <lb/>rare isotopes of about 10 <lb/> 8  (10 <lb/> 6  ) atoms. With an assumed <lb/>half-life of 100 000 years (λ = 2·10 <lb/> −13  s <lb/> −1  ), these numbers <lb/></body>

			<body> correspond to activities of 20 μBq (or 0.2 μBq), far below <lb/>any chance to be quantified by activity measurements. <lb/>In AMS the typical measurement procedure is the fol-<lb/>lowing: In a cesium sputter source, negatively charged ions <lb/>are produced and pre-accelerated before they pass a low-<lb/>energy mass spectrometer, which analyzes a specific mass. <lb/>The ions are further injected into a tandem accelerator <lb/>(at VERA we use up to +3.5 MV terminal voltage). Any <lb/>molecules that might contribute to a molecular interfer-<lb/>ence are completely destroyed in the terminal stripper of <lb/>the accelerator. Due to this stripping process, only atomic, <lb/>mostly positively charged ions leave the tandem accelera-<lb/>tor. A specific charge state is selected by a second, high-<lb/>energy 90 <lb/> •  analyzing magnet for further transport to the <lb/>detector. At VERA using the 3-MV tandem, the particles <lb/>have energies between 10 and 25 MeV. Stable isotopes will <lb/>be measured as currents using Faraday cups while the ra-<lb/>dionuclides are counted directly with a particle detector. <lb/>Rejection of isotopic interferences can be achieved with <lb/>additional filters, like a Wien-filter, an electrostatic ana-<lb/>lyzer, and a time-of-flight system. Further reduction of any <lb/>isobaric and isotopic interference is also achieved by means <lb/>of specific energy-loss techniques, used either in front of <lb/>the detection system or as a part of the particle detector <lb/>(see also sect. 4, Ca-measurements with VERA). A final <lb/>particle detector delivers the energy of the incoming ions <lb/>while they are fully stopped. The detection beam-line at <lb/>VERA is described in [6]; typical parameters for the vari-<lb/>ous nuclides measured at VERA are listed in [5,9]. <lb/>AMS is a mass spectrometric technique. Basically, it <lb/>measures isotope count rates for different isotopes. To <lb/>this end, sequentially, stable ion currents are measured <lb/>with Faraday cups, positioned at the low-energy and high-<lb/>energy sides of the AMS beamline (fig. 1). These current <lb/>measurements are sandwiched by counting the rare iso-<lb/>tope with the particle detector. With this raw data, i.e. <lb/> countrate and particle current, an isotope ratio is calcu-<lb/>lated. However, possible long-term drifts of the particle <lb/>transmission along the beamline have to be monitored. For <lb/>quality control, the transmission is regularly monitored by <lb/>means of standards with well-known isotope ratios. An-<lb/>other ion may also mimic a true event in the detector. <lb/>Contamination from chemistry or in the ion source may <lb/>induce an additional &quot; true &quot; signal. In addition, isobaric <lb/>interferences have to be controlled. Note, that impurities <lb/>in the sample after chemical preparation are typically on <lb/>the ppm-level, whereas the rare isotope content is another <lb/>6 to 9 orders of magnitude lower. In order to quantify or <lb/>check the background level, blank samples are therefore <lb/>measured, too. <lb/>The overall efficiency (i.e. fraction of particles detected <lb/>to that inserted into the ion source), which includes the ef-<lb/>ficiency for producing negative ions, stripping yield, trans-<lb/>mission through the beam line and detector efficiency, de-<lb/>pends strongly on the isotope under investigation. For car-<lb/>bon measurements up to several percent can be obtained <lb/>at VERA but in other cases one has to deal with an overall <lb/>efficiency as low as 10 <lb/> −5  [9]. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex"> 3 Applications of AMS related to astrophysics <lb/> 3.1 Search for supernova-produced radionuclides on <lb/>Earth <lb/> Ellis, Fields and Schramm 1996 [10] and Fields [11] <lb/>pointed out that there might be a chance for finding long-<lb/>lived radionuclides in terrestrial archives, which were orig-<lb/>inally produced in a supernova (SN). Several candidates <lb/>had been identified by [10], among them <lb/> 26  Al, <lb/> 53  Mn, <lb/> 60  Fe, <lb/> 146  Sm, <lb/> 182  Hf, and <lb/> 244  Pu which are produced in sufficient <lb/>amounts to be in principle detectable on Earth. Such ra-<lb/>dioisotopes, which have been ejected into the interstellar <lb/>medium, may be picked up by our Solar System when it <lb/>passes through such a region and those nuclides will fi-<lb/>nally become incorporated into terrestrial archives, like <lb/>sediments or ice cores. SN-rates in our stellar vicinity, <lb/>are expected to be rather common. In a rough estima-<lb/>tion Fields [11] calculates a rate of the order of a few SN <lb/>events per million years within a distance of 100 parsec <lb/>(pc). From that follows, that proper radionuclides should <lb/>have half-lives also in the million-year range, far too short-<lb/>lived for surviving from the formation of the Solar System. <lb/>Radionuclides with those half-lives are best measured us-<lb/>ing the technique of AMS. It is crucial to exclude contami-<lb/>nation of these SN-produced radionuclides from other nat-<lb/>ural sources (e.g., cosmic ray production, natural fission). <lb/>Indeed, with the use of AMS, a strong peak of <lb/> 60  Fe <lb/>(T  1/2  = 1.5 Ma) was found recently in a deep-sea man-<lb/>ganese crust profile [12], which confirms the presump-<lb/>tion of Ellis et al.. This unusual isotope signal is inter-<lb/>preted as live radioactivity deposited on Earth originat-<lb/>ing from a supernova explosion three million years ago, <lb/>and at a distance of several tens of pc [12,13]. Hence, <lb/>they are eagerly sought fingerprints of recent, explosive <lb/>nucleosynthesis. However, this signal needs confirmation <lb/>from other radionuclides. Possible other candidates are the <lb/>r-process nuclides <lb/> 182  Hf (8.9 Ma), <lb/> 244  Pu (80.6 Ma), and <lb/> 247  Cm (16 Ma). In some cases (e.g., <lb/> 244  Pu), man-made <lb/>contributions have to be carefully evaluated. <lb/>The extremely low isotopic abundance of such radionu-<lb/>clides asks for a very sensitive detection method. Acceler-<lb/>ator mass spectrometry (AMS) is currently the only tech-<lb/>nique capable to measure such ultra-low isotope ratios. At <lb/>VERA, techniques for measuring the isotopes <lb/> 182  Hf and <lb/> 244  Pu have been developed [34,14,15]. Whereas the detec-<lb/>tion of SN-produced <lb/> 182  Hf still suffers from interference <lb/>from the stable isobar <lb/> 182  W and needs further technologi-<lb/>cal developments, in the case of transuranium elements no <lb/>stable isobar exists. Therefore, e.g. <lb/> 244  Pu detection has to <lb/>deal with the rejection of isotopic background only. The <lb/>mass-selective low-energy injection system at VERA [16] <lb/>and the dedicated low-background heavy-ion beamline in <lb/>combination with the highly reproducible conditions make <lb/>VERA a favorable system for measuring those isotopes. <lb/>For the case of <lb/> 244  Pu measurements, no isotopic interfer-<lb/>ences from other isotopes are found at VERA. This setup <lb/>has also been proven to be very valuable for measuring the <lb/>various other Pu isotopes in environmental samples [17]. <lb/>In those cases, the man-made content of Pu is investigated <lb/></div>

			<body> which allows for example to reconstruct the neutron his-<lb/>tory of that environment. However, the isotopic signature <lb/>of these other Pu isotopes ( <lb/> 239,240,241,242  Pu) is a measure <lb/>of the man-made <lb/> 244  Pu, too, because this information can <lb/>be used to extrapolate the anthropogenic content of those <lb/>Pu isotopes to the expected anthropogenic <lb/> 244  Pu concen-<lb/>tration in the sample material. Using the 14 MV tandem <lb/>accelerator in Munich, C. Wallner et al. found a ratio for <lb/> 244  Pu/ <lb/> 239  Pu of 10 <lb/> −3  [18]. In a first measurement of a deep-<lb/>sea manganese crust they found one single count of <lb/> 244  Pu <lb/>in a background-free measurement. Since no <lb/> 239  Pu was <lb/>detected, no <lb/> 244  Pu counts from anthropogenic sources are <lb/>expected. A second, independent measurement to quan-<lb/>tify <lb/> 244  Pu in deep-sea sediment has been performed by M. <lb/>Paul et al. [19]. They also found one count of <lb/> 244  Pu in <lb/>their sample, however this signal is compatible with their <lb/>expectations of anthropogenic origin using also the <lb/> 239  Pu <lb/>content of that sample. <lb/>In ref. [17] typical spectra from Pu measurements of <lb/>environmental samples measured at VERA are shown. <lb/>Best discrimination is obtained using the information of <lb/>2-dimensional spectra which comprise time-of-flight sig-<lb/>nals and energy signals. It is demonstrated that the high-<lb/>energy mass separator is capable to suppress ions from <lb/>neighboring masses completely which is important for de-<lb/>tecting <lb/> 244  Pu. To summarize, using this setup, VERA <lb/>has proven to be capable to quantify supernova-produced <lb/> 244  Pu in terrestrial archives. If successful, the long half-life <lb/>of <lb/> 244  Pu (80 Ma) gives the possibility to trace the mean <lb/>abundance of <lb/> 244  Pu in the interstellar medium [18,19,20], <lb/>which may contain ejected material from several SN ex-<lb/>plosions. <lb/> 3.2 Measurement of production cross-sections <lb/> The observation of live radionuclides provides direct ev-<lb/>idence for ongoing nucleosynthesis. Radionuclides, like <lb/> 26  Al [21] and <lb/> 44  Ti, can be traced in the sky as live radioac-<lb/>tivity. Such mappings identify active areas in our Galaxy. <lb/>The relevant stellar scenarios are an essential key for un-<lb/>derstanding celestial evolution. At VERA cross-section <lb/>measurements have been performed, e.g. for the quan-<lb/>tification of <lb/> 26  Al [22,23]. The background level for <lb/> 26  Al <lb/>detection at VERA is found to be at 6 · 10 <lb/> −16  . This ex-<lb/>tremely high sensitivity enables us also to apply AMS for <lb/>the measurement of the <lb/> 25  Mg(p, γ) <lb/> 26  Al strength functions <lb/>at astrophysical interesting energies [24]. To this end, Mg <lb/>targets have been irradiated with protons. After the ir-<lb/>radiation the produced <lb/> 26  Al is extracted for the succes-<lb/>sive AMS measurement [25,26]. Because of the very small <lb/>cross-sections a very limited number of <lb/> 26  Al atoms is pro-<lb/>duced, which requires both, a high overall efficiency of the <lb/>measurement and very low background interference. <lb/>Another prominent example for applying AMS is the <lb/>neutron capture cross section of <lb/> 62  Ni producing the ra-<lb/>dionuclide <lb/> 63  Ni. This reaction plays an important role in <lb/>the control of the flow path of the slow neutron-capture <lb/>nucleosynthesis process [27,28]. Its cross-section was iden-<lb/>tified as a key value to describe correctly the isotopic <lb/>pattern around <lb/> 62  Ni [29,30]. AMS has also been used <lb/>to determine the production of <lb/> 44  Ti via the <lb/> 40  Ca(α, γ) <lb/> reaction [19]. Apart from these examples, a lot of addi-<lb/>tional measurements have been performed or are being <lb/>performed using AMS. At VERA a measurement program <lb/>is underway for studying neutron capture reactions for <lb/>various isotopes, too. <lb/> 4 Ca-measurements with VERA <lb/> Another AMS nuclide is <lb/> 41  Ca. This radioisotope has a <lb/>half-life of 104 000 years (see, e.g., [31]). The long half-<lb/>life together with its direct electron-capture decay to the <lb/>ground state of <lb/> 41  K makes this nuclide difficult to de-<lb/>tect via decay counting. The measurement of this nuclide <lb/>is of interest in astrophysics for a quantification of the <lb/> 40  Ca(n, γ) cross section at stellar energies, which is under-<lb/>way at different laboratories. In the following some recent <lb/>developments at VERA for the detection of the long-lived <lb/>radionuclide <lb/> 41  Ca are presented. <lb/>Natural <lb/> 41  Ca/Ca isotope ratios are of the order of <lb/>10 <lb/> −14  to 10 <lb/> −15  . Such low ratios have been measured at <lb/>other AMS laboratories using CaH  2  samples for AMS. <lb/>CaH  2  needs a very elaborate sample preparation and sam-<lb/>ple handling. This chemical form was necessary because <lb/>the stable isobar <lb/> 41  K does not form stable negative <lb/> 41  KH <lb/> − <lb/> 3 <lb/> -ions. Thus, using CaH  2  , effective isobar suppression is <lb/>achieved and isotope ratios of the order of 10 <lb/> −15  can be <lb/>quantified using AMS [32,33]. However, in cases where the <lb/> 41  Ca content is not as low as in natural concentrations, i.e. <lb/> for isotope ratios of the order of 10 <lb/> −13  or higher, an alter-<lb/>native chemical form can be used. Calcium fluoride sam-<lb/>ples, CaF  2  , have been proven to be a suitable material for <lb/>such applications with much simpler chemical preparation. <lb/>Here we want to present first results on <lb/> 41  Ca detec-<lb/>tion with a 3 MV tandem accelerator using CaF  2  . To this <lb/>end a new isobar discrimination technique, the so-called <lb/>deltaTOF technique [34,35] has been applied. Note, <lb/> 41  Ca <lb/>is not a typical nuclide for small accelerators since isobaric <lb/>interferences at this mass range are usually not sufficiently <lb/>resolved by standard AMS-techniques having particle en-<lb/>ergies below 1 MeV/amu. The measurement of CaF  2  sam-<lb/>ples at VERA has become possible by the availability of <lb/>so-called silicon nitride (SiN) foils, which offer a very ho-<lb/>mogenous foil thickness. The method applied is the fol-<lb/>lowing: mass selected ions pass through sufficiently thick <lb/>degrader foils and loose energy, depending on their atomic <lb/>number Z. Thus isobars, which have initially the same <lb/>velocity, have different velocities after the foil which is <lb/>measured using a high resolution time-of-flight setup. The <lb/>homogeneity of those SiN-foils yields resolvable energy dis-<lb/>crimination above the inherent energy straggling. <lb/>We could utilize a series of <lb/> 41  Ca standards, which were <lb/>kindly supplied by K. Nishiizumi [36] and G. Korschinek. <lb/>They span a range of isotope ratios from 1.2 · 10 <lb/> −10  and <lb/>5.9·10 <lb/> −13  . These standards allow us to optimize our AMS-<lb/>setup and to investigate the limits of a 3 MV tandem ac-<lb/>celerator for quantifying <lb/> 41  Ca using CaF  2  samples. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 2. Measurement of a <lb/> 41  Ca-standard dilution series. The nominal ratios represent the quoted <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca isotope ratios, the <lb/>measured <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca ratio is the raw uncorrected ratio of the <lb/> 41  Ca count-rate and the <lb/> 41  Ca particle current. Blank samples <lb/>with expected negligible <lb/> 41  Ca content were assigned to a nominal ratio of 1 · 10 <lb/> −15  . <lb/> The measurement procedure applied at VERA is the <lb/>following: in the cesium sputter source, negatively charged <lb/> 41  CaF <lb/> − <lb/> 3  -ions are produced and injected into the tandem <lb/>accelerator, which is set to a voltage of 3.3 MV. After the <lb/>tandem accelerator, <lb/> 41  Ca <lb/> 4+  ions, having energies of about <lb/>15 MeV, are identified with the detector setup described <lb/>above. However, the detection efficiency drops with the ad-<lb/>ditional scattering when the beam is passing the thick SiN <lb/>foils. To this end, the flight path has been reduced from <lb/>2.2 m as used for heavy ion measurements (see fig. 1) to <lb/>0.65 m. The time resolution is still sufficient since energy-<lb/>loss straggling is the main contribution to the width of the <lb/>peaks. Besides the time-of-flight information, utilizing an <lb/>ionization chamber at the very end of the beam-line, the <lb/>total residual energy of the incoming ions is measured, too. <lb/>Six different Ca-standards have been measured apply-<lb/>ing this technique. In fig. 2 the measured <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca iso-<lb/>tope ratios are plotted versus their nominal values. Mea-<lb/>sured data represent the absolute ratios, uncorrected for <lb/>background events. The absolute value of these data re-<lb/>flects the beam losses between the position of the current <lb/>measurement and the particle detection system. Losses are <lb/>mainly due to the beam scattering in the thick SiN foils. <lb/>The data should follow a straight line if background in-<lb/>terference is of no concern. Blank samples are plotted at <lb/>the left part of the figure assigning them a nominal ratio <lb/>of 10 <lb/> −15  . The background value found for such samples <lb/>during these measurements was about 3 orders of mag-<lb/>nitude lower than the value of the highest Ca standard <lb/>with a quoted ratio <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca of 1.16 · 10 <lb/> −10  [36], which <lb/>results in an normalized value of about 1 · 10 <lb/> −13  for that <lb/>blank samples. The uncertainty of these blank samples en-<lb/>ters into the final values and dominates already the error <lb/>of the standard material with the (lowest) nominal value <lb/>of 5.9 · 10 <lb/> −13  (see error bars). Different symbols in the <lb/>plot depict the use of SiN degrader foils of different thick-<lb/>ness: measurement series I was carried out using 1000 nm <lb/>thick SiN foils and measurement series II using a 1650 nm <lb/>thick foil. This figure clearly shows that <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca iso-<lb/>tope ratios of a few 10 <lb/> −13  can be quantified with this <lb/>setup. In a later measurement series the K-background <lb/>showed a somewhat enhanced count rate, which was up <lb/>to a factor of 20 higher than for the previous measure-<lb/>ments. A possible reason for this higher background rate <lb/>might be the preceding cleaning of the ion source which <lb/>was combined with the replacement of some source parts. <lb/>Those new parts are suspicious to K-contamination. A sys-<lb/>tematic investigation of possible sources for this enhanced <lb/>background is presently underway. <lb/> 5 Summary <lb/> It has been shown —for the first time— that a 3 MV tan-<lb/>dem accelerator is capable to measure <lb/> 41  Ca/ <lb/> 40  Ca ratios <lb/>down to a few 10 <lb/> −13  . The reproducibility of those mea-<lb/>surements was found to be between 5 to 8 %. Applying <lb/>the deltaTOF technique allows the use of CaF  2  samples <lb/>despite potassium will form negative ions and therewith <lb/>isobars of <lb/> 41  Ca will be produced, too. For samples with <lb/>ratios on the order of or below 10 <lb/> −12  a moderate <lb/> 41  K <lb/></body>
