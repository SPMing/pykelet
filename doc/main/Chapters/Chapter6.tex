\subsection{Key Results}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Different training algorithm and regularisation.
\item Emulating our modelling of head collaborations in references.
\item Expanding training set (it turns out HEP papers are distinct from )
\item Combining features. We did in fact try combining some if our best features, but the performance did not improve (cite McCallum)
\item Enhancing the evaluation utilities. We went some way towards this in \ref{subsec:extensions} which tells us the worst k documents. But it would require further work.
\end{enumerate}
